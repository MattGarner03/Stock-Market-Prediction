===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome, and thank you for joining the SBA First Quarter 2025 Results. This call is being recorded. All participant audio lines are in listen-only mode. There will be a Q&A session at the end of prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you. Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2025 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 28, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll now turn it over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Great. Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon. 2025 got off to a good start in the first quarter. Results were broadly in line with our estimates, and activity levels continue to demonstrate a healthy level of growth. In the U.S., our mobile network operator customers continued growing their level of network investment around our macro tower sites. We had our best quarter going back several years in terms of new domestic leasing business signed up during the quarter. Most encouraging, though, is that our leasing backlog also grew from December 31, meaning we are adding new applications at a greater pace than we are signing up new business. This bodes well for the balance of the year. We also continued to see a higher percentage of our new U.S. leasing business coming from new lease colocations versus amendments to existing leases. And our U.S.-based Services business had a great quarter as well, with activity levels and results ahead of our expectations. We also saw our new business backlog grow for Services during the quarter and as a result of the strong start to the year and our growing backlog, we have increased our full year outlook for Services. In our international markets, we also saw a positive start to the year with solid leasing activity. In addition, elevated CPI rates in some of our markets have presented the potential for better existing lease escalations during the year. Across our markets, our customers have many network goals, which will require continued investment. Macro sites remain the most effective and cost-efficient way to advance wireless coverage and deploy new spectrum and technologies. Our portfolio is well-positioned to capture growth from these initiatives over the next several years. In addition to our operational achievements during the quarter, we also made progress in the areas of portfolio management and capital allocation. During the quarter, we completed our exit from the Philippines, and on last quarter's earnings call, we announced our planned exit from Colombia. We were able to finalize the required steps to complete this exit and formally sold our Colombian operations prior to quarter end. These steps have allowed us to improve our focus and allocation of resources. We continue to evaluate all of our operations to identify ways to improve our market positioning or gain further synergies. In addition, during the first quarter, we closed on a small portion of the Central American sites previously put under a purchase agreement with Millicom International. While there are numerous regulatory and diligence steps remaining, we will continue to explore opportunities for additional early closings. Against the backdrop of the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and the resulting market volatility, the stability and consistency of our company and our business stand out. We have not experienced nor do we foresee any direct impacts from the current tariff policies. Our business continues to generate steady cash flow, and the underlying needs of our customers remain robust. As a result, we have significant confidence in our company and our future. Subsequent to quarter end, we have demonstrated that confidence by repurchasing 583,000 shares of our stock at an average price per share of $210.87. We have also announced today that our Board has approved a new $1.5 billion share repurchase plan, supporting our ability to return significant value to our shareholders. The combination of this plan and our industry-leading dividend growth provide a direct line of shareholder returns, while our existing capital structure allows us the flexibility to still pursue meaningful asset investment opportunities. We are very well positioned. For the balance of 2025, SBA will be focused on operational execution, driving efficiencies in our processes, particularly through the incorporation of new technologies and systems, enhancing our relevance to and relationships with our largest customers, and bringing a balance of entrepreneurial spirit and informed financial discipline to capital allocation and expansion. Some of these focus areas may seem straightforward or mundane, but our ability to excel in each of these areas will be what sets SBA apart from our peers. The wireless ecosystem will continually evolve, providing new opportunities for those willing to take them. I believe we have the people, experience, and DNA makeup to maximize these opportunities. Before turning it over to Marc, I'd like to thank our team members who represent that experience in D&A. Our team members represent SBA well every day and continually put the goals and objectives of our customers first. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the balance of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Marc, who will provide additional details on our results.
Marc Montagner: Thank you, Brendan. Given the solid start to the year, we are increasing our full year outlook for all key metrics, including Site leasing Revenue, Tower cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, and AFFO Per Share as compared to our initial 2025 guidance. The primary drivers of these increases include in line first quarter result, the closing of a small portion of the acquisition of Towers from Millicom earlier than expected, an improved outlook for Services, slightly higher straight line revenue due to the extension of some leases and a reduction in the share count from recently completed buybacks. First quarter domestic organic leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 5.2% on a gross basis, 1% on a net basis, including 4.2% of churn. $20 million of our first quarter churn was related to the Sprint consolidation, which we anticipate to be approximately $50 million to $52 million for the full year 2025. Our previously provided estimate of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next seven years remain unchanged. Beyond 2025, we anticipate approximately $50 million in 2026 and $20 million thereafter. Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn continues to be between 1% and 1.5% of our Domestic Site Leasing Revenue. During the first quarter, 80% of consolidated Cash Site Leasing Revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. International organizing leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant-currency basis, was 1.6% net, including 5.6% of churn or 7.2% on a gross basis. Total international churn remained elevated in the first quarter due mostly to carrier consolidation. We believe that post carrier consolidation in some of our international markets, the remaining wireless operators will be stronger in a better position to invest for the long term. This will support a steady growth rate for our operation in those countries. During the first quarter of 2025, we acquired 344 sites for a total cash consideration of $58 million, mostly related to the acquisition of sites from Millicom in Nicaragua. The contribution to the 2025 outlook from closing earlier than previously assumed is $4 million of site leasing revenue and $3 million of tower cash flow. The remaining 6,700 sites related to the Millicom transaction remain under contract, and the guidance continues to assume the September 1 closing date. The closing date is dependent upon regulatory approval and other requirements and may differ from this date. We also built 67 new sites in the quarter, mostly outside of the U.S. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity from both cash on the balance sheet and a fully undrawn $2 billion revolver. The recent share buybacks were funded fully with excess cash and did not require any borrowing. Our current leverage of 6.4 turns, net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains near historical low. As of the end of the first quarter, our weighted-average interest rate was 3.7% across our total outstanding debt, and our weighted-average maturity was approximately four years. Including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate on 98% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. And finally, our net debt maturity is a $750 million ABS security due in January of 2026. Now, let me turn the call over to Mark.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.5 billion of total debt and $11.8 billion of net debt. As Marc mentioned, our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.4 times below the low end of our target range. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remained strong at 4.9 times. During the second quarter, we repurchased 583,000 shares of our common stock for $123 million at an average price per share of $210.87. On April 27, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase plan, replacing the prior plan that was authorized in October of 2021, which had a remaining authorization of $82 million. This new plan authorizes the company to purchase from time-to-time up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock. The new plan has no time deadline and will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by the Board of Directors. In addition, during the first quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $122.3 million, or $1.11 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.1 -- I'm sorry, $1.11 per share payable on June 17, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 22, 2025. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 13% over the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2024 and approximately 35% at the midpoint of our full year AFFO outlook. Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs.
Jim Schneider: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first on the overall carrier environment. It sounds like fairly constructive commentary on the direction of travel here. Maybe just was wondering if you could comment on any updates in terms of carriers' plans in the U.S. and their willingness to devote any capacity to fixed wireless access, as far as you can see at this point? And then secondly, on the capital allocation front, the buyback of $1.5 billion was encouraging to see. How are you thinking about just the overall environment for capital allocation at this point? Rates are obviously probably a little bit higher than you might have thought six, nine, 12 months ago. How are you thinking about the refinancing needs potentially for 2026 and the level of buybacks you'd want to do right now and assuming nothing changes in the rates environment today? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure, Jim. So on the carrier environment overall, as you heard in our prepared comments and in our press release, things are generally pretty positive here in the U.S. There's a lot of work to be done. We're seeing a greater amount of leasing activity than we've seen over the last two years. So broadly, we feel very positive about that. And the fact that the backlogs continue to grow is an indication that there's still a lot of work to be done. And so that's part, as I said in my comments, that's perhaps the most encouraging thing. In terms of the specifics of what they're focused on in fixed wireless access. Our belief is that fixed wireless access is certainly a contributing factor when you look at our customers' recent reports on their own results, you saw that that's where a significant portion of their subscriber growth is coming from. We know that is a very heavy broadband-consuming product, and therefore, it drives a lot of usage of the capacity of the network, and therefore, would be a driver of the need for incremental investment in their networks and infrastructure. So, I can't tell you specifically because it's using the same frequencies and spectrum, generally speaking, as their mobile network, but we do think it's a driver, and there are many drivers. So we just feel good about the pickup in activity. On the second question around capital allocation, I -- the rates are certainly staying higher here for longer. It's hard to say for sure, obviously, in the current environment, as to when we'll see rates moving lower, if we'll see rates moving lower. But our positioning is very good. As you heard, our leverage position today is well below where we've historically carried our leverage balance. And as a result, that gives us a lot of flexibility. We did buyback shares because we saw the opportunity to do it here in April, as there were some dislocation around some of the announcements that were affecting the market more broadly. We took advantage of that. And I think if we see additional opportunities, we'll continue to take advantage of it. The new plan that was put in place by our Board is evidence that we expect to be allocating capital towards share repurchases. But as we said in the past, you should expect that our approach to capital allocation should be really a mix of buybacks, new asset investments where we see good opportunities, and debt repayments in addition, of course, to our dividend. So it hasn't really changed, and we're pretty comfortable with our positioning to be able to be flexible and adjust as opportunities present themselves.
Jim Schneider: Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: All right. Moving on to Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin: Hi.
Brendan Cavanagh: Hi, Jon.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. So I was curious about just given what you said about the current activity level, the backlog, where do you think you might end the year on a run rate basis for U.S. leasing? Any kind of products, and metrics you could share with us?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, it's a little hard to say absolutely at this point because I got to see how things continue to build, but it certainly would expect to end at a higher level than we're at in terms of what we produced here in the first quarter, and that was approximately $9 million from new leases and amendments here in the U.S. I definitely expect to be higher than that when we get to the fourth quarter, but I'll refrain from giving an absolute number there until we see how the rest of the year progresses.
Jonathan Atkin: And then secondly, I was interested just where you stand in terms of the bilateral contracting relationships you have with major customers in terms of pay by the drink or things like amendments, colocations, and just give us kind of a refresh on MLAs?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So we have -- I wish we not typically had the kind of holistic MLAs that you're referring to. We've always had master lease agreements in place with our customers, but they've usually been equipment-specific in terms of how they paid us for the use of our sites. The exception to that was the deal we did with AT&T a couple of years ago, which was more of a holistic approach. We're open to a holistic approach with our customers, but it really is just dependent on the specific give-and-take within the negotiations around those agreements. So, yes, we'll just have to see how it goes. But at this point, the only true holistic agreement we have in the U.S. is the one that we signed with AT&T a couple of years ago.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks very much.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Our next call comes from Batya Levi, UBS.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you. A couple of quick questions. First, can you talk a little bit about what's driving higher network services business and versus what you had expected earlier in the year? And when we look at domestic churn, it looks like it picked up a little bit excluding Sprint. What were some of the drivers for that? And maybe on the M&A front, a couple of Tower portfolios -- portfolios are available for sale in Canada. You have some exposure to the region there, slower growth market, but can you provide some color on how you would approach M&A in Canada? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. So first question was on Services and why it's growing faster than we expected. Really, it's as simple as one of our customers in particular, just operating at a much faster pace than we had even expected here in terms of their network investments. And so we're just seeing them, frankly, just move quicker. It's kind of that simple. And I would expect based on the backlogs growing, that they'll continue to keep a fast pace during the rest of the year, and that's why we raised our outlook for the full year. So we'll continue to try to meet their needs and keep up with them. On the U.S. churn, you said it was growing. It's basically in line with what we put out at the beginning of the year. So I don't think it's beyond what our expectations were. I don't know if you're asking about year-over-year, but --
Batya Levi: No, it's - I guess it's - yes, it's within the range you've given, it's just picked up slightly versus the last two quarters, maybe.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes.
Batya Levi: It used to be around 1%.
Brendan Cavanagh: I think that's really just a timing thing. If you look at our full year outlook, we didn't change it. And I think the implied percentage for the full year for the U.S. is around 1.2%. So it was 1.4% in the first quarter. So you should take that to imply that it will be a little bit lower at other points during the rest of the year. And then on the Canada side, really, we approach that the way we approach most major M&A opportunities and portfolios that come to market anywhere, really around the globe, particularly obviously in the markets where we already have operations. We will look thoroughly at any of those opportunities. And if we can see value there and see it at a price point that we think makes sense and is competitive and is better than, we certainly will be interested in pursuing that. I think you've heard us talk about our approach to our international markets over the last year or so in terms of what we'd like our positioning to be. Obviously, in Canada, if you have the mobile network operators up there divesting of their towers, whoever ends up buying those will certainly be in a lead position in terms of their size and scale in the market. So that would be something that we would consider in our analysis of any deal. But at this stage, you should expect that we'll look at any opportunities that come to market. And I can't say whether it will work or not, but if it does, it's something we will certainly pursue.
Batya Levi: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next caller, Walter Piecyk, LightShed.
Brendan Cavanagh: Walt?
Operator: Mr. Piecyk, your line is unmuted. Please make sure your phone isn't muted.
Walter Piecyk: What about now?
Brendan Cavanagh: Hi.
Operator: We can hear you now.
Walter Piecyk: Sorry about that. I guess I'll ask about -- I guess I'll ask about our friends at DISH. I think there were some press reports about them wanting to lease or looking to lease their spectrum. I think it might have been some rural areas, and maybe there's no impact there, but in general, just can you just characterize, kind of, what they've told you about some of their longer-term plans, what role you may play? And then alternatively, I suppose, has there been any inbounds from cable companies you might be considering spectrum that's available in the market and want to redeploy their own? I would guess that they want to do a little due diligence ahead of that to see what type of expenses that they want to take on. So I mean, basically, the same question about that DISH.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Well, you're probably not going to love my answer because there's not a lot of detail to offer there. I'll take the cable one first. There really hasn't been much in the way of direct conversation. We talk to them periodically, but there's no -- there's nothing really along the lines of what you just described. So, I think until they have something firmer in hand, they frankly don't really need to spend a lot of time talking to the tower companies just yet, but we'll see how it develops.
Walter Piecyk: Can I just interject on that one before you go back to it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Walter Piecyk: Even on CBRS, because I think Comcast has made -- mention at least in some investor meetings that the initial attempt with CBRS might have been tied to a vendor that didn't really deliver. They moved to, I think it was Samsung or something, and I know a lot of that's kind of in-home, but I thought there was an opportunity, especially with the current SEC, to increase the power ability of CBRS for them to start hitting towers. No, even early indications of them looking to try and offload of the rising expense at Verizon?
Brendan Cavanagh: Very limited, Walt. I mean, we have conversations with them. We've actually talked with them about CBRS over the years at various times. But when I look at it from a materiality standpoint to us, it's really completely immaterial.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. And then on the flip side, like the DISH, what do you -- have you heard -- have you seen the stuff about them leasing out specimen rural? Does that touch any part of your contract, and otherwise, what are they saying in terms of their intermediate-term plans, let's call it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. There's -- at this stage, they have -- there hasn't really been any specific conversations in terms of the leasing. If they do lease their spectrum, their contract doesn't allow for that to change it's in somebody else's hands. So there would have to be a conversation, and we've not had that conversation as of yet. In terms of just their broader commentary and feedback with us, we work pretty closely with them. They on the operation side are very clear about their desire to continue to pursue their standalone greenfield network. At this stage, obviously, things are much slower in terms of leasing activity with them. So we're hopeful that changes. But at this stage, it's really just meeting some very basic needs. There's some basic upgrades going on. They are signing a few leases here and there, but it's pretty small at this stage. So, I don't have much feedback for you there either, but I would -- I'll be interested to hear what they have to say on their call.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. Thanks. Sorry for the technical difficulties.
Brendan Cavanagh: No, no worries. Thanks.
Operator: Okay. Moving on to Michael Rollins from Citi.
Michael Rollins: Thanks, and good afternoon. Two topics, if I could. So first, on the international front, just curious if you could share an update on how the visibility is trending for organic growth as well as the churn dynamics, and specifically in Latin America, both for this year and over the next few years? And then second, I was just looking at the supplemental, and thanks for the refresh, I think you began on this last quarter. The supplemental, looking at the straight-line revenue, and what caught my attention was the straight-line revenue is negative this year for the first time in like five years, and goes more negative next year. And so, as these contracts on average are getting further into their life, does that increase the potential for some renewals? And is that something that could significantly just impact the way GAAP results look over the next few years, that might be different than what the schedule is currently inferring.
Brendan Cavanagh: Let me try to answer that second one first while I'm thinking about it. I don't think so. I mean, basically, if you think about what straight-line revenue is, it's essentially revenue that, from an accounting standpoint, we're booking, but we haven't actually received the cash. So eventually, it's going to all go negative and reverse out and end up at zero cumulatively. I think what you're seeing is that as we've had less new leases and moved further in terms of the dates and the timing of our portfolio as it gets more mature, you should expect that it would move back towards that sort of breakeven point. Now, having said that, we are signing more new leases today, and perhaps that will have an impact. And as we, in some cases, extend out the length of the terms. We'll see some adjustments up, and actually, that did happen in the first quarter. We extended some leases out. So that pushes the timing. But I don't think that there's anything to be read into it other than just we're a more mature business and we're in a more mature place in terms of our life cycle with our biggest customers. So it's going to move up and down over time, but eventually, if you went to the end of time, it would be zero cumulatively. And so the other question was on international, I think, Mike, right, organic growth and churn, is that what your question was on dynamics?
Michael Rollins: Exactly. Yes, the visibility into this year as well as into the next few years, as you're managing through some of the Latin American churn dynamics.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We are -- each market is a little different. And in some of the markets, we have experienced churn over the last few years due to consolidations and we're pretty close to being on the other side of that, and a number of markets, we are on the other side of it. If you look across many of our Central American markets, you had that consolidation take place. You've had most of the rightsizing of those leases happen as a result of that. And so I think we're going to be in a good spot there, and actually, you're going to have carriers that are more interested in their network development and investing further in their networks, and therefore, we're going to actually see some pickup in activity in that area. In other spots, like in Brazil, we're really just kind of in the throes of the consolidation impacts and everything that comes with that. We talked about it a bunch over the last year. So, everybody knows that Oi was replaced by the other three carriers taking a piece of them, each of them, but that leaves a lot of overlap and a lot of rationalization needs to take place, and we're seeing that take place. We're also still seeing the impacts of the Nextel acquisition by Claro, and that was done years ago. So, I would say for the next few years, we probably will see some elevated churn internationally as a result of those dynamics. And that -- I think the hidden cost of that is not just the churn, but it is the fact that rationalization takes a lot of the focus of the existing carriers. And so the organic growth in terms of new lease-up is also impacted, I think a little bit by that. So I would say the next few years will probably be a slower growth period in Brazil, in particular, which is the lion's share of our international business. But as we move beyond that, based on what we've seen in other markets, including the U.S., by the way, I would expect there to be an acceleration of leasing activity as we start to get further down the maturity cycle of that process.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next caller is Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank.
Matt Niknam: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. First, on the macro front. I'm wondering if sales cycles, conversations with carrier customers, particularly in the U.S., are lengthening at all? Or are you seeing carriers even potentially reevaluating spending plans in light of what's developing into a choppier macro backdrop? And then just secondly on the U.S. as well. If you can give us any color on the mix of colo relative to amendment for new leases signed in 1Q and how that compares to prior quarters? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We -- so the answer to your first question, Matt, is we have not seen an impact on any of our sales or leasing discussions with our customers. But I also think that it is pretty fresh and it's not something that I can swear won't take place over the coming months. I do feel very good in the sense that we obviously have no direct impacts from tariffs. Our carrier customers have limited relative to most companies here, international companies, obviously, in particular, the impacts on our carrier customers are very limited. So, I think we're not going to see a lot because there's still such significant network needs, and there's a competitive dynamic that exists among our customers that I think is also favorable to continued investment. But we'll have to see how the microenvironment around this topic evolves and where it ends up going, and obviously, there's a possibility that it has an impact. But as of today, we've not seen any of that. And your second question was colos versus amendments, right?
Matt Niknam: That's right.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So we've definitely seen a pickup in the colocations that started last year and has continued into this period now where we're seeing the vast majority actually of new revenue added in the U.S. coming from new lease colocations versus amendments. I don't actually have the percentage handy to give you, but that's something our team can probably provide to you in a follow-up call afterwards, but most of it is coming from new leases. And based on the backlogs and the way they're building, I would expect that to continue for the balance of the year.
Matt Niknam: Thank you.
Operator: Our next caller is Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead
Nick Del Deo: Thanks for taking my questions. First, Brendan, in your prepared remarks, you noted that driving efficiencies through new technologies and systems was a priority for the year. Can you expand on that at all, and maybe frame some of the areas that you're looking at, the sorts of savings that you're expecting? And then second, you decommissioned a lot of towers overseas this quarter. Is that all oil-related, or are there other drivers, anything we should be aware of there? And how should that trend in the coming periods?
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yes. So on the efficiencies, we are -- I mean, this is stuff that you should expect that we will be doing anyway, Nick, but I call it out because it's an internal focus area that we are definitely spending some time on. We have a number of new systems that we are putting in place in various areas of our business, some on the operational and front-end side around leasing, others around back-office operations, including our ERP systems, getting a total refresh. And as we do that and we incorporate AI and other things into the solutions that we're providing, we will look for efficiencies in the way that we run these processes. And I think through that, we will actually gain not only cost savings, but opportunities to drive additional revenue sources as well. It's too early at this point to probably quantify that for you, but over time, I would hope that I'll be able to give you some idea of places where we've actually realized real savings that make an impact on the financials.
Nick Del Deo: Only thing you mentioned…
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes.
Nick Del Deo: Sorry to jump in. You mentioned the ERP system. I know sometimes that's been problematic for some companies when they change that out. Do you feel comfortable from a risk profile because that's typically a big change for folks.
Brendan Cavanagh: I do. It is a big change, and it's actually a multi-year project, but I feel very good about where we are today and the progress we're making on that. But yes, okay.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Good.
Brendan Cavanagh: No worries. Yes.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. And then the decommissioning question?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. The decommissioning, so -- and just to be sure that we're clear, because you probably are looking at the total number for international, that includes the divestitures of Colombia and the Philippines, which took place. So, just to be clear, that's the vast majority…
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Yes. Okay.
Brendan Cavanagh: So if you strip that out, though, we are decommissioning some sites, primarily in Brazil, and that is -- it is an association with the consolidation where we're seeing places where we have taken towers that we don't think have much -- promise, sorry. In those cases, we'll take those towers down to save the cost, but most of that number is the sale of those two countries.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you, Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Next question is from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Good. Thanks for taking the question. Brendan, I think you talked a little bit about the increasing colo mix in your backlog. Any sense for you have for how much might be related to regulatory requirements that certain carriers have, that have specific time to be deployed, versus kind of any early signs of densification in your footprint from your early mid-band deployments.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Well, first, let me -- since you gave me the opportunity here to go back and answer Matt's question on the actual percentages, it was about 75% of the new leasing business signed up in the first quarter in the U.S. came from colos as opposed to amendments. So then, to your question, it's a mix of things. Definitely, the regulatory requirements is a part of it. And I only know that with confidence because when we look at least one of our carrier customers and we look at the locations and sort of the more rural nature of some of those, that gives us a pretty good sense of what they're trying to accomplish there. But it's really hard to say in every case because you have real network needs in all these different spots. And so, whether it's for a commercial reason or a regulatory reason, sometimes we don't have that clarity, but I would expect that we'll continue to see a balance of both of those factors as a driver.
Eric Luebchow: Okay, great. I appreciate that. And on the services guide uplift, I believe you over-indexed to one carrier in particular there. So would you attribute that uptick to that customer, or is it a little bit more broad-based than that? And I guess, do you think there's any correlation here between the services upside and some of the higher leasing activity that you've talked about in your backlog? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I do think that there is a correlation to the leasing at least a little bit because most of the work that we're doing, virtually all the services work we're doing now is on our own power sites. So it's definitely tied into leasing activity. And yes, I mean, we do have a significant percentage of our Services business with one particular carrier, but the increase at least proportionally among them is more broad-based. But obviously, that one customer makes up a bigger percentage, and therefore, as they get busier, that makes more of an impact to our outlook.
Eric Luebchow: Thanks, Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Our next caller is Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc.
Brandon Nispel: Thanks for taking the question. Brendan, I want to go back to your comments around new bookings and backlog. From a historical standpoint, what period is most comparable to the new bookings you saw this quarter? And then I was hoping you could help us contextualize what the book-to-bill ratio looks like today. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yes, I don't know if I could say absolutely, but it's been a couple of years. It's been over two years, I'd say, since we saw this level of applications that drive our backlog. So it's pretty good in terms of recent history. We were pretty busy back in the '22-'23 window. So, it's probably as good as it was any time since then. I'm sorry, Brandon, your second question.
Brandon Nispel: I was just curious book-to-bill backlog and sort of where that -- what that looks like today?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. It's still because of this shift in the mix to new leases, it's obviously more elongated than it's been historically. It's typically a six to nine-month for a new colo. We've seen a little bit of improvement in that. It's probably been a little bit shorter than that on average at least thus far into the year, which is not that much history, but they're turning them around a little bit quicker and getting them deployed quicker. So let's say, three to nine months, just to kind of hedge it. It's -- every lease is a little bit different, but that's the typical range.
Brandon Nispel: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Moving on to Mike Funk from Bank of America.
Mike Funk: Thank you all for the questions today. So, first one, just what do you attribute the increase in new leasing activity from the carriers based on your conversations with them? And then maybe split between the carriers would be helpful as well. And then second one kind of more bookkeeping. You mentioned during the prepared remarks that CPI rates have a potential for better escalators throughout the year internationally. If you can quantify, that would be helpful.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, So the increase -- I don't want to get too specific by customer in terms of what they're each doing. I think you can look at their own reports and get a sense of the things that they're focused on that would be the logical drivers of activity in terms of leasing on macro tower sites. But it's broadly increased subscriber activity, certainly certain product offerings that are more network bandwidth-intensive, such as fixed wireless access. There are some regulatory requirements, which we referred to a moment ago, for at least one of our customers, that's T-Mobile, who has some need to meet obligations in terms of downlink speeds and coverage that they committed to as part of the Sprint acquisition. So that's ongoing as a driver as well. So there's a variety of things. I think we'll continue to see a mix of those things. But overall, it's going to be a strain on the network and competitive pressures between the carriers. And on the CPI question, yes, I mean, particularly in Brazil, we've seen an increase in the CPI rates down there. I -- we will have to see whether that holds up. We obviously didn't raise our outlook around international escalator contributions for this year. But if we continue to see elevated CPI rates down there, there's a potential that we would actually be able to raise our leasing outlook. And we're really talking about on our total for the full year, you're talking about a million or $2 million of impact. So it's not a massive number, but as a percentage, it's a reasonable contribution increase.
Mike Funk: Great. Thank you for the question.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: All right. Moving on to Ric Prentiss from Raymond James.
Ric Prentiss: Hi, Good afternoon, everybody. I think I messed up my pound too here. I appreciate the questions.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Ric Prentiss: First question, I want to follow along the lines. A lot of people touched on the colocation amendment. Appreciate the 75, 25 for 1Q number. Was that revenue-based, I assume instead of application-based, because I would expect new colocations come in at a significantly higher amount of revenue than an amendment?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Yes, that's revenue-based dollars.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. Which also then leads to activity. Also, associated with that kind of looking at new colocations versus amendments, what's your outlook as far as when spectrum -- new spectrum, not just secondary like Walt was asking about, but what new spectrum could be found auctioned and put into the system that would drive more spectrum deployments instead of having to split sites? Any update from Washington that you're seeing on the spectrum front? And when we might see some blocks come out, and when they might show up on your towers?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I don't obviously have any insight that is specific to when you're going to see it. But the general commentary that we get back in the conversations that we have and that our industry association WIA has is that there's definitely much more of an interest in this administration and the FCC to get new spectrum out there and auctioned off. And so we're encouraged by that. I think even if they get that done in relatively short order by the time it gets cleared and is available and then is actually deployed, I mean, you're talking four or five years from now, probably before we would see an opportunity for increased leasing activity as a result of that, Ric. So it's a ways off. But the faster that we get it done and out there and get this process started, the quicker we can get to that point. So, we're definitely pushing for that from our industry.
Ric Prentiss: All right. Industry could definitely use more spectrum, but it's going to take time, which means we should probably count on colocations, more so than amendments being a trend it feels like.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, which obviously isn't bad. I mean, we're fortunate in terms of where we're placed in the ecosystem, and that if you don't have the spectrum, the only solutions you've got are to densify your network, and that typically means more locations for us and more equipment, which is a good thing.
Ric Prentiss: Great. Last one for me. Obviously, good capital allocation, jumping on the dislocation in the stock price. But when you think about M&A that might be out there, Batya asked about the Canada towers, but are you still seeing private multiples being well above, or just above what the public multiples are going forward? And kind of how is that still impacting the ability to compete and win for external towers?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We are still seeing that. If you're talking about the U.S., because there is a limited supply of potential assets, and there are a lot of people very interested in acquiring U.S. towers. When those opportunities come about, the private valuations are much, much higher than the public valuations, and that makes it a challenge for us. Internationally, in some of our emerging markets, we're -- we've seen that rationalize a little bit more, but what you're actually seeing is very few assets trading hands at all. So I think what's happening is sellers are not getting interest at the levels that they'd like to or that perhaps they were getting in the past, and buyers aren't willing to come up to those levels. So you end up having deals, just not trade. So I'm feeling better about there being a little bit of rationalization in most of the international markets, although I'm not seeing that so much in the U.S. and hopefully, we will see that kind of balance out because I think it will be good in terms of that the health of the overall industry if we have more rationality brought to some of these analyses. You can't have cost-of-capital raising the way that it has and have no change in the approach that people take to valuing these assets. So, hopefully, we'll start to see that.
Ric Prentiss: It makes sense. In the U.S., much, much higher. Are we thinking mid-20s, high-20s, even into the 30s? Is that kind of what we're seeing out there?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, it just depends on the portfolio to some degree because of the maturity of it makes a difference. But we're definitely seeing assets that are trading in the mid-30s, in some cases even higher.
Ric Prentiss: Well, great. Yes. Well, appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: All right. Moving on to Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.
Ben Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions. Brendan, we touched on it in a few of your answers. Just trying -- can you give us a sense of your visibility into sort of the full year domestic site leasing growth? Should we look at the activity to service revenue growth, and the mix-shift to colocations is adding to that visibility? I just wanted to get a sense, sitting here at late April, sort of the line of sight into the improving revenue trends domestic -- in the domestic business as we look through the rest of the year? And then I just thought a little bit of a housekeeping. Can you just update us on if there's any change to how we should think about the Millicom contribution to revenue and gross profit when the rest of the bulk of the acquisition closes on -- assuming it closes September 1? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So, we do break out in our press release, our outlook for the contribution to leasing that we expect during the full year, and the range that we set for that for the U.S., we did not change after this quarter. It's only been two months since we gave that outlook originally. And I think at this stage, while my commentary is accurate in terms of the accelerating pace, and that we're feeling very good about it as the backlogs have been bigger and the lease up was a little bit ahead of pace. I think that it's a little early to think that we're going to be outside of the range that we gave. But we'll see where we are next quarter, we'll certainly have a much better sense by then as to whether there's an opportunity to beat the range. But, perhaps we'll be more towards the higher end of the range if things continue on this track. So stay tuned on that. At least we're talking about it being towards the higher end and not towards the lower end.
Ben Swinburne: Okay.
Brendan Cavanagh: That's a good sign. And then on the Millicom question, yes, I mean, at this stage, the outlook that we put together originally hasn't really changed outside of the sites that we closed on early. Obviously, we adjusted for that. There's -- I don't know, Ben, if you're looking for something in particular, but basically what we laid out in terms of the total expectation when it's all said and done, that's still the same as what we put in our original press release when we announced that deal. No real changes there, but we'll be excited to get it done as soon as we can.
Ben Swinburne: Okay. The only change, I guess, is just part of that acquisition is closed already, right?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, just a timing difference.
Ben Swinburne: Yes.
Brendan Cavanagh: So it's a fairly small piece of it. There were 320 sites that we were. And if we can close other pieces early, we will do that too. I think there's not as great an opportunity to break off other pieces each -- this particular market, there was an opportunity to buy the asset separately as opposed to an entity. And so that allowed us to close a few early. But we'll see how it goes. If we can close them early, we'll do that.
Ben Swinburne: Great. Thank you so much.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks.
Operator: Okay. Moving on to Richard Choe from JPMorgan.
Richard Choe: I had a follow-up on the Services side. Was the increase more in near-term activity, or is it just feeling more confident about the level through the year? And then also, how much more services revenue could you fulfill, or how much capacity you have in that Services business kind of from this 180 to 200 level?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, the Services -- the increase in guidance for Services is a mix of the contribution from the first quarter where we did a little bit better than we had anticipated when we set the original outlook as well as the increased backlogs, which gave us some confidence that we will do better during the balance of the year versus our original projections as well. So it's really a mix of both of those. And on your question on capacity, I'm not sure what you're getting at. I mean, obviously, we've given an outlook for this year of now updated of $180 million to $200 million. In the past, we have had even bigger years, a couple of years ago, we did almost $300 million in Services revenue, high $200 million. So we have the capacity in terms of our capabilities and scalability to handle increased volume if we can find the right work. And so if we see that opportunity, hopefully, we'll continue to see it grow. But we're not restrained in terms of our capabilities or capacity.
Richard Choe: Great. Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Moving on to Jonathan Chaplin from New Street.
Jonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Just one clarifying question from me. So, I think in the past, Brendan, you said that the 2.5 gigahertz and 3.5 gigahertz spectrum that the carriers have deployed on their sites is sort of 55% to 65% of sites. Is that of your sites, or their sites? The way I've understood it initially was there at sort of 55% to 65% of their sites, and they still got a lot of growth to go. And I would have thought that would have traded into -- translated into a lot more amendment -- amendments, full to come as opposed to what you're seeing, which is the bulk of growth coming from new leasing.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. No, it's -- when we give those statistics, we're giving it on our -- their presence on our sites, the leases that we have with them on our sites. Yes, it's not to their overall position that's up to them to comment on. So -- and the carriers are not balanced in terms of that. Obviously, T-Mobile is further ahead because they had 2.5 spectrum well ahead of the other incumbents having their mid-band C-band spectrum. So it's a mix between them, and that perhaps is what's contributing to the shift of who's moving towards new leasing versus amendments faster. But either way, they're through -- on a consolidated combined basis, cumulatively, they're through about close to 60% of our leases with the three incumbents have been upgraded for mid-band spectrum.
Jonathan Chaplin: Got it. So wait, that's 60% of their sites. So they -- they've done amendments on 60% of their sites for mid-band spectrum already. And so there's another 40% they could -- they could still do amendments on.
Brendan Cavanagh: As a -- yes, as a group. When -- we're talking about their leases on our sites.
Jonathan Chaplin: Yes. And so they're not doing incremental. So, but that's not where the activity is coming from at the moment. It's mostly coming from them putting equipment on new sites.
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, yes, I mean, we're still signing a bunch of amendments, and the amendment activity is largely around that. It was largely 5G-related upgrades. Yes.
Jonathan Chaplin: Perfect. Thanks for that clarification.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Next caller, David Guarino from Green Street.
David Guarino: Yes. Thanks. Hi, Brendan, going back to your comment on the transaction front. You said the bid-ask spread might be too wide for some deals to cross the finish line. Was that comment in reference to the past few weeks and the volatility we've seen, or is that something you've observed over the course of the year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. No, it's something we've observed really for the last year or so internationally, where you're seeing we've seen a number of potential transactions come to market, processes run, some we participated in, others we have not, and there are a number of them that did not actually get completed. So it's been a dynamic. That's been happening for the last few years. So really, if you look at the timing of when cost-of-capital started to increase sometime following on that time period, you started to see this dynamic.
David Guarino: It makes sense. And then you had a comment in your press release talking about the business having very reliable cash flow amidst economic uncertainty. And that's definitely been true in the past. But since the tenant landscape has evolved since that, we've really had any sort of economic stress-test. How should we think about SBA's portfolio performing if the U.S. economy were to hit a soft patch?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, I think, David, if you look at it from a big-picture standpoint, we produced a tremendous amount of cash flow. Our AFFO is about $1.4 billion a year. And even if there's softness in the U.S. or anywhere else, you're talking about a variation of leasing activity and incremental dollars being added that is relatively small in the -- in the big picture of the cash flow that we're able to produce, the amount that we're able to return back to our shareholders. There's no risk to our ability to continue to operate, or in quote some saying, sell our product. Well, it's already been sold. It's already happening. So we're talking about impact happening on incremental additions. And right now, that's a positive environment, and that's great. But even if things were to slow down, you're talking about fairly small amounts. So my commentary is that compared to most businesses out there, the cash flow that we're able to produce can be relied upon. It is very steady and consistent, and that's a good place to be in a -- in an unstable environment.
David Guarino: Good point. Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Here, moving on to our next and last caller, Ari Klein from BMO Capital Markets.
Ari Klein: Thanks for squeezing me in here. The commentary on domestic leasing activity and signing continues to get better. Based on the conversations with carriers, is that something you expect to continue to accelerate and maybe build here for the next couple of years, or does it level-off kind of in the range where you're at now?
Brendan Cavanagh: I think that's a hard question to answer to look out multiple years. We -- we've seen this play out over decades of being in this and there are some periods where the carriers are busier than others, but it tends to move in cycles as different events happen. And I think if you look out over the coming years, this year, we're obviously feeling very confident and excited about the level of activity as it's continued to increase based on the specific drivers that are in place today. That -- there are a number of factors that could come along that cause that to slow, and there are factors that could come along to cause that to increase. As we look out longer term, we know that there will be new spectrum that's eventually made available and that will be a driver of increased activity. There's eventually a 6G cycle that will take place down the road. And so over time, I feel very good that there will continue to be cycles of investment in networks by our customers, and we will see -- we will be a beneficiary of that. But to say from one year to the next, whether this year is going to be a higher or lower year, it's hard to say without -- with too much precision if we look out multiple years. So, I'll just leave it at that. We'll see how it goes, but you should feel comfortable that there's always another cycle of something needed.
Ari Klein: Got it. And maybe if I can just kind of move it -- moving that leasing activity to backlog, up from backlog to leasing or to leasing revenue. I think one of the things is the guide this year is the midpoint is down a little bit from last year, despite the improvement in activity. Is that something when we look out to '26, we should expect that a decent ramp given how active you've been?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. If we continue to see it move the way that it's moved thus far this year and it stays with the same trajectory as we move through the balance of the year, that should be favorable to next year because that's -- the reason this year is down compared to last year, even though the activity is better this year than last year is because there's a drag. There's a lag time between when you sign up these agreements and when they start to hit your financials. And so we will see this benefit into the balance of this year, but particularly into next year as it carries over.
Ari Klein: Thanks for the color.
Brendan Cavanagh: No problem. Well, thank you all for joining the call today, and we look forward to reporting our second quarter results at the end of July.
Operator: That concludes the SBA first quarter 2025 results conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome, and thank you for joining the SBA Fourth Quarter 2024 Results. This call is being recorded. All participant audio lines are in listen-only mode until the Q&A session of the call. We'll give you instructions on how to enter the queue at that time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss in this call is forward looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2025 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 24, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found under supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. As part of an ongoing effort to improve our earnings materials, we have made certain modifications to the supplemental financial data package and will be providing the materials in both PDF and Excel form. Note, the revised package does not exclude any previously provided financial or operating metrics. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon. The fourth quarter was a solid finish to the year. Results for the quarter were in-line to slightly ahead of our estimates, even with worse-than-assumed foreign exchange rates. Domestic new carrier activity or bookings continued to increase sequentially from the third quarter. The shift in the makeup of our new business also continued, the higher percentage coming from new lease colocations versus amendments to existing leases. Our carrier customers continue to expand their 5G mid-band coverage, including adding capacity for fixed wireless access, as well as extend network coverage into areas of the country that have little to no cell coverage today. Even with increased bookings in the quarter, our leasing application backlogs grew throughout the quarter and finished at the highest level of the year, and our US-based services business had its best quarter of the year as well. The beginning of 2025 is also off to a strong start, suggesting another quarter-over-quarter increase in new leasing business to begin this year. Our 2025 services outlook contemplates a year-over-year increase in that business. Our US customers are busy and we expect to be a key partner to them this year in support of their network goals. Internationally, our fourth quarter results were in-line with expectations as our customers continue to invest in their networks. In almost all of our international markets, the mobile network operators are well behind the US in terms of 5G coverage. We anticipate continued network investment to close that gap and to broadly expand coverage to underserved areas. In many ways, wireless is an even more critical service in our international markets than in the US. International churn, unfortunately, continues to be elevated, largely due to customer consolidations, and we are working closely with our customers to help them achieve necessary network efficiencies. We believe the surviving customers will be stronger and better positioned for ongoing investments, and ultimately, will support greater stabilization in our international cash flows. Overall, 2024 was a successful year. While our stock performance was hindered by the headwinds of the macro interest rate environment and a strong dollar, we had several accomplishments that set us up well for the future. Operationally, we expanded and strengthened our relationships with our largest customers. We grew our leasing and services backlogs, refreshed our mission, vision, and values, and streamlined a number of our operations and processes. With regard to capital allocation, we invested over $550 million in asset acquisitions, stock repurchases, and new tower builds, all while growing our dividend at an industry-leading 15%. We also improved our balance sheet and liquidity position. In the beginning of the year, we refinanced our $2.3 billion term loan, pushing out the maturity to 2031, extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility and increased it from $1.5 billion to $2 billion and subsequently entered into a forward-starting interest rate hedge, reducing our future floating rate interest exposure and locking in a much lower rate than can be achieved today. In addition, in October, we refinanced $2.1 billion of tower securities at rates well below where those same securities would price today. We ended the year at 6.1 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, the lowest level in our history. In February of last year, I laid out my strategic priorities, focusing mostly on ways to enhance the portfolio with the goals to stabilize results, grow the core business, and improve the overall quality of our assets, be it through inorganic growth or new agreements with our customers. While we still have work to do, we made major strides toward these goals. As announced last quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase approximately 7,000 towers from Millicom in Central America. This immediately-accretive transaction positions SBA as the leading tower operator in the region with over 10,500 pro forma sites. Beyond just the absolute size and scale, this deal aligns us with one of the leading MNOs in the market under long-term US dollar denominated lease agreements. We also entered into a significant build-to-suit agreement with Millicom that we expect will drive growth and further improve our position in the region for years to come. In fact, our 2025 outlook incorporates a planned level of up to 800 new tower builds this year, the largest number for SBA in over 20 years, with the majority of those in Central America. Needless to say, we're excited about this transaction and its contributions to our future growth and stability. Alternatively, when we are in a subscale position and don't see a path to scale or other potential limitations on a market's future performance, we'll look to exit those markets. Like, we did in Argentina back in the fourth quarter of 2023, we officially exited the Philippines in January. And today, we've also announced we are under agreement to sell our operations in Colombia. Colombia market represents less than 200 sites and the impact of the financials are immaterial. It is not our desire to exit markets. In fact, it is much more our preference to find ways to scale, aligning with leading carriers and driving returns. We will continue to look for ways to do just that across our remaining markets. Each of the steps taken over the past year will help our teams be better focused and better positioned to maximize new business opportunities. Looking at 2025 and beyond, the key growth drivers remain intact. Mobile network consumption continues to grow and limited new spectrum availability means more equipment at the cell site. Fixed wireless access, the incorporation of next-gen AI applications and handsets, regulatory buildout requirements, and remaining 5G coverage expansion are expected to contribute to ongoing network investments. The strength of our balance sheet and the significant free cash flow that we generate every year will allow us to continue investing in high-quality new assets, as well as shareholder remuneration through industry-leading dividend growth and share repurchases. We are optimistic about our future opportunities. Before turning it over to Marc, I'd like to thank our team members. The company's ability to achieve our vision to be our customers' first-choice provider and the industry leader in quality infrastructure solutions is only possible because of the incredibly hardworking team members we have here at SBA. I'd also like to thank our customers for their trust in us and we look forward to collaborating with them to achieve their network goals. And with that, I'll now turn things over to Marc, who will provide additional details.
Marc Montagner: Thank you, Brendan. Fourth quarter domestic organic revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 5.1% on a gross basis and 2.2% on a net basis, including 2.9% of churn. In the quarter, we added approximately $8.5 million in new leases and amendments billings. With respect to the 2.9% of churn, 1.6% was related to Sprint consolidation or approximately $7 million. Year-over-year, international organic recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 1.7% net, including 6% of churn or 7.7% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, gross organic growth was 8.7% on a constant currency basis. [Core] (ph) international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter to mostly to previously announced carrier consolidation. During the fourth quarter, consolidated cash site leasing revenue and adjusted EBITDA denominated in US dollars was 78% and 81%, respectively. The majority of non-US denominated revenues from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.6% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. This earnings press release includes our initial 2025 outlook. Domestically, outlook reflects both the lower level of carrier bookings we experienced in 2024 and our expectation for increased activities throughout 2025. We're guiding to a range of $35 million to $39 million from new leases and amendments. The outlook also assumes a range of $50 million to $52 million related to Sprint churn and $20 million to $22 million regular churn. Our previously provided estimate of aggregate Sprint related churn over the next several years remains largely unchanged with an estimate of approximately $50 million in 2026 and approximately $20 million thereafter. For international segment, our outlook reflects steady network investment, guiding to range of [$16 billion to $18 billion] (ph) for new lease and amendment. The outlook also assumes a range of $27 million to $31 million related to churn. Churn continues to be elevated as we work through carrier consolidations, some carrier bankruptcies or restructurings, and wireless operators' network rationalizations. We are working with our current customers to minimize churns over the long-term. Additionally FX continue to be a headwind and we're guiding to a negative $25 million year-over-year impact from FX on site leasing revenue. Turning to services, we're guiding to a range of $160 million to $180 million in revenue, reflecting the increased carrier activity we are seeing at our sites today. We saw a meaningful increase in activity in the second half of 2024 and we expect to see similar levels throughout 2025. Outlook assume an anticipated closing date of September 1 for the previously announced Millicom transaction, contributing approximately $42 million to cash site leasing revenue and $29 million of total cash flow to our 2025 outlook. The ultimate closing date is dependent upon regulatory approval and other requirement and may differ from this date. Please also note that outlook does not assume any further acquisition beyond those which as of today are under contract and expected to close by year-end. We also do not assume any share repurchase in outlook. However, it is possible [we may] (ph) invest in additional asset or share repurchase or both during the year. I will now turn the call over to Mark, who will provide additional details.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Marc. As we previously announced on our third quarter call in October of last year, the company issued through an existing trust two tranches of Tower Revenue Securities for a total of $2.07 billion, which included a tranche of $620 million issued at 4.654% with an anticipated repayment date of October 2027 and a final maturity date of October 2054. We also issued a tranche of $1.45 billion issued at 4.831% with anticipated repayment date of October 2029 and a final maturity date of October 2054. Our next maturity is a $750 million ABS note due January 2026. Our current leverage is 6.1 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was very strong to 5.5 times. Our weighted average maturity is approximately 3.4 years with an average interest rate of 3.2% across our total outstanding debt. As of today, our $2 billion revolver remains fully undrawn. During the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $105.4 million or $0.98 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $1.11 per share payable on March 27, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2025. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 13% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2024 and approximately 35% of the midpoint of our full year AFFO outlook. And with that, operator, we are ready to turn the call over to questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And let's go ahead and go to our first caller, Batya Levi from UBS.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you. Can you provide a little bit more color on the increase in the backlog that you're seeing right now? Do you see that coming from increased applications from a specific tenant or is it more broad across your -- all your tenants? And maybe some color in terms of how should we think about the book to bill cycle to be with colocation increasing? I know you just guided for '25, but if we assume it's a back-end loaded year, is it fair to assume you have good visibility for US leasing to be up next year? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So, the mix in terms of the backlog, I would say, is fairly broad. It's not exactly the same for each carrier. There are certain ones that are perhaps a little busier than others, but generally speaking, they're all up in terms of the applications that are coming in. And there are more -- as we mentioned in our prepared comments, there definitely are more -- there's more business coming from new leases relative to amendments to existing leases like we've seen in the past. And so that shift in the mix of the type of new bookings that we're seeing will drive the book to bill cycle to be later, and therefore, we would expect to see growth quarter-over-quarter throughout this year in terms of the contributions domestically from new leases and amendments. And so, yeah, I think that generally speaking would be favorable to next year, but it's certainly a little premature to be talking about what next year's number is going to look like. Let's see how this year plays out, but our expectation is we'll see growth move up as we move through the year.
Batya Levi: Sounds good. Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: All right. Moving on to our next caller, Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs.
Jim Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. With many of your carrier customers in the US having sort of given a multiyear outlook for CapEx, which is sort of consistent with what the past couple of years, how should we think about your ability to sort of grow domestic leasing in the outyears relative to this year's guidance, if those budgets remain where they are? And maybe what are some of the areas that would allow you to sort of outperform those overall CapEx growth envelopes, whether it's densification, fixed wireless or otherwise?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, Jim. I mean, the carriers obviously have very large CapEx budgets. And so, what would probably be relatively minor shifts in the mix or makeup of those CapEx budgets can have a more meaningful impact on us. And so, I'm not too concerned about their overall CapEx budgets being relatively flat because what we're seeing on the ground is a lot more activity around their wireless networks and specifically the macro-based networks. So, as I look out into the future, I can only see what's happening now and what they're telling us today, and that suggests, a lot more activity. And I think, actually, the lack of incremental spectrum being added to the mix means that they have to make sure that what they have stretches farther. And I think that's actually going to turn out to be decent for us in terms of their planning in the next couple of years.
Jim Schneider: Thanks. And then, Brendan, just to follow-up on that, I believe in your opening script, you mentioned that there you saw demand specifically for fixed wireless capacity additions. Can you maybe clarify whether that is fixed wireless capacity above and beyond or completely separate from conventional mobile capacity, or maybe any color on where that is happening would be helpful. Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I mean, honestly, it's a little bit hard to distinguish from what we see going on to the sites in terms of basic 5G mobile capacity versus fixed wireless access, but what we're hearing is in our conversations with the carriers on the ground that that is a meaningful driver of the incremental investment in some of these locations. So, what I'm giving you, I guess, I would characterize as anecdotal, but we're definitely seeing the increased activity. And so, we mentioned that because it is one of the drivers that we hear from our customers as to the increased investment that they're making, but I think it's probably an all-of-the-above type of thing ultimately.
Jim Schneider: Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] All right. Let's move on to our next caller, Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank.
Matt Niknam: Hey, thanks so much for taking the question. Two if I could. First, on the leasing outlook for '25, maybe Brendan, if there's any commentary you can offer in terms of what's baked in for customer-specific activity across the three nationals in DISH? And then, just secondly, on the services outlook, so the guidance for $160 million to $180 million, it's a little bit shy of the annualized exit rate from 4Q. If you just annualize the fourth quarter number, it implies closer to $190 million. And so, I'm just wondering if there were any one-timers in the fourth quarter, or if you're assuming any sort of moderation from any customers next year? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yeah. So, on the second one first, there's no one-timers in the fourth quarter. I think what we're giving you is based on what we have in our backlog today and the conversations we're having with the carriers, the services guidance is a little bit harder to be completely precise on when you look out for the full year at this stage of the year because it's not a long-term contractual cycle the way it is in the leasing business. So, as you get to the second half of the year, we tend to take perhaps a slight bit of conservatism in our approach to the back half of the year. So, I don't think there's anything really that you should read into that, Matt, in terms of against the fourth quarter of last year. On the leasing outlook, yeah, I mean, we prefer to stay away from too much detail on a customer-specific basis. As I mentioned in the answer to a previous question, we're seeing each of the big three carriers increase their activity levels, and so, they're all contributing to that. We do have contributions from certain carriers that have regulatory obligations for coverage and download -- downlink speeds that are driving big percentage of the activity that we're seeing. So, in one particular case, that's a main driver, but really they're all busier. So, I would say among the big three, that's the case. And as it relates to DISH, we're not seeing nearly as much as we have in the past. So that's a much a much, lesser contribution.
Matt Niknam: Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Okay. Moving on to Richard Choe, JPMorgan.
Richard Choe: Hi. Just wanted to follow-up on the mix of business. I assume still kind of heavier amendment versus colo, but by the end of the year, do you see that being more even or actually even more colo?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. It's actually -- we're actually seeing in terms of dollars more -- and this is the US we're talking about specifically, but we're seeing greater contribution from colos today versus amendments. Historically, it's obviously been amendments predominantly, but that has happened in terms of that shift, at least on a dollar basis. The number of agreements, because the amendments are lesser dollars, tend to still favor the amendments.
Richard Choe: And then, you have Sprint churn this year and some next year. Is there any kind of positioning in terms of maybe wanting to get that all into this year at some point, or is it still just kind of waiting for it to roll off?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, Richard, I mean, at this stage, most of this year's Sprint churn is stuff that's frankly already happened or just about to happen in some cases. And this is -- the financial impact of it is what's in our numbers for this year. And when you look at next year, which is the last big year, most of the impact of that will be driven by leases that expire right towards the end of this year or the beginning of next year. And so, there's really not that much time to try and pull something in. And in order to do that, you would expect, I think, that T-Mobile would expect some sort of balance in that, but there's something in that for them if they're going to pay it off early. So, the quick answer is I don't think that's likely to occur, in terms of accelerating it. But at this stage, we're down to the final years of the material impact. So, I think everybody knows what it is at this stage.
Richard Choe: Great. Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Okay. Moving on to Michael Rollins from Citigroup.
Michael Rollins: Thanks, and good afternoon. Two questions. First one, if I could follow-up on the last one, as the merger churn is picking up in the US, is there a corresponding increase in fees for carriers leaving the equipment behind? And is that something that could be a significant contributor, whether it's this year or over the next few years as you kind of wrap up some of this merger churn? And then, secondly, just maybe taking a step back on capital allocation, if you can give us an update on how you're thinking about your target debt leverage and the priorities for capital? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. On the Sprint piece, there are fees associated with decommissionings or pay-and-walk type of fees, But, actually, a lot of that stuff has been incurred, because even though, the churn is sort of spread out over this time period, in a number of cases, the installations have been decommissioned already. In fact, actually, if you look at our -- the other bucket, if you look at our bridge of revenue and you look at the other bucket domestically, you'll see that it's actually down a bit. And that is one of the contributors is that we've had a decent amount of that kind of contributing to our numbers in the previous years, and so it's a little bit less now. There's still going to be more of that because there certainly are sites where they're still continuing to decommission the equipment at those sites, and we typically do that work, but I don't expect it to be something that would be all that meaningful to the results that we report. And then, on the target debt level, going forward, you know what our historical target range has been, and we've been well below that target range for quite a while now. And I think at this stage, I don't see any reason that we will likely shift from the level that we're at sort of between 6 turns and 6.5 turns of net debt to EBITDA leverage. And I say that not because it's our desire to necessarily keep it at that level, it's really about the opportunities for the investment of capital. And I think if we see meaningful investment opportunities of size and we needed to lever up a little bit to accomplish those investments, then we will be comfortable doing that, but as I sit here today and knowing that we can fully handle the Millicom deal that we're closing on later this year, I think it's a reasonable expectation that we'd probably be somewhere below 6.5 times as we get to the end of the year. And that's what's implied in our current numbers that we've guided to.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: All right. Our next caller, Ric Prentiss from Raymond James.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks, everybody. How are you doing?
Brendan Cavanagh: Hey. Good, Ric. How are you?
Ric Prentiss: Good, thanks. Hey, I want to follow-up on Michael's question a little bit further. Where do you think leverage needs to be investment-grade? You guys don't have a lot of final purchase options. Could you be investment-grade kind of in the 6%, 6.5% -- or 6 times, 6.5 times range?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. Well, based on where the agencies have indicated, and it's actually out there publicly, as the break points, I do believe that we could be investment-grade certainly with at least one of the agencies and I think with both, at the level that we're at today. It's really more of a commitment as to our intention to stay there or to go lower. And we're frankly not yet ready to make that commitment, but at some point, that will be the natural course for things, and it'll happen. I just think it's a little premature to do that today. And, frankly, I'm not sure that we get much benefit from doing it right now, particularly on a cost of debt basis, it would be very small to give up the flexibility that I think is more valuable right now.
Ric Prentiss: Right. Of course, sometimes they let you flex up as long as you commit to bring it back down.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Ric Prentiss: The Millicom transaction, remind us how much turns of leverage that should be putting on as we look at closing the deal in September and what it means kind of leverage next year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I mean, by itself, it puts on about 0.2 turns of leverage, so very, very small. And obviously, depending on what we're doing in other places, that may or may not even show up as we get to the end of the year. So, when you're producing $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion of AFFO, we can absorb actually a lot, and not really move our leverage.
Ric Prentiss: One more kind of strategic question and then one kind of [outyear] (ph) question. But when you think about AI, you touched on in your opening remarks, when and how will AI affect towers? We've seen it obviously affecting data centers, but will AI benefit towers and how so and when?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, if I could answer that as explicitly as I'd like to, that would be good. It's hard to say for sure, Ric, is the honest answer. We are -- we do believe that there certainly will be a positive impact as we mentioned in the prepared comments when you -- as you see these generative AI functionality embedded into the handsets. And that's really because it's a driver of incremental usage and incremental network capacity that we expect will actually be taken up as a result of those solutions. So, it's not that different from other things that have been introduced in the past that have driven greater use of the network. So that broadly is very good for us. Obviously, there are AI benefits within our own business that we're introducing every day and continue to evaluate here to become more efficient, provide better information to our customers, that we think could drive [leasing] (ph), that kind of thing. But in terms of something more explicit than that, I think there could be, but I think it's a little too early to know for sure.
Ric Prentiss: Makes sense. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, sure.
Operator: All right. Moving on to Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery: Good evening.
Brendan Cavanagh: Hi, Simon.
Simon Flannery: To Millicom, you talked about a September 1 close. Can you just update us on where the deal timelines are? What's the sort of sensitivity is that going to be? Do you have good line of sight to that? Could it be earlier? Could it be later? Might it close in stages? And then, Marc, you talked about the Sprint churn. Could you just give us a little bit of update on the international churn '26 and beyond what you're seeing remaining from Oi and some of the other consolidation? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So, on the Millicom closing date, we gave you what we consider our best guess, at September 1. There's a lot of different factors that are potentially going to contribute to the timing of that. It definitely could be a different time than that. I mean, honestly, it's our desire and, frankly, it's Millicom's desire to close earlier or at least close parts of it earlier. And if we can do that, we will do that because it's additive and we'd both like to get going here, but there are certain regulatory hurdles that need to be cleared and other diligence items and certain other things that need to get addressed. So, we pegged it at September 1 for purposes of issuing the outlook. And, obviously, if it closes earlier or parts of it close earlier, we'll update our outlook as we move through the year if that happens. I don't expect that it would necessarily close later. It's certainly possible, but I think that's unlikely. And then, the international churn, there's a mix of things going on there. I mean, unfortunately, most of the churn that's in our outlook internationally is in Brazil. And, I would say, unfortunately, it's a little bit higher than we probably would have thought before, largely built around the Oi consolidation. But it's not necessarily just the direct consolidation. It's also all the steps that the carriers are taking, going through that process, the surviving carriers are taking to rationalize their networks and deal with other focus areas. And so, they're -- as you would imagine trying to be as efficient as they can. And we're trying to help them through that in a way that is balanced for us too, but it is pulling forward, I would say, some churn that we probably thought would have been spread out over a little bit longer period of time. And then, beyond that, it's a lot of different cats and dogs in different markets. The next biggest thing outside of Brazil honestly is a few million dollars of churn in Panama associated with the Claro-Liberty consolidation. So, we have those things that are still going on. But as I think that runs down, we'll see that improve. And actually, it'll be good for these markets as it will stabilize the markets.
Simon Flannery: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next caller is Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, good evening, guys. With respect to services, you've got one customer that's historically been much larger than the others. I guess, are you seeing any diversification of services work in '25 versus '24, or would you say it's broadly similar?
Brendan Cavanagh: I would say, we're seeing increases across the board, but that one big customer is increasing quite a bit as well. So, I'm not sure that the mix is going to change all that much. We're still pretty heavily concentrated. And a lot of that just is based on agreements that exist with some of the other carriers with turfing vendors and things like that. And we continue to work with them because I think I believe in my opinion that they would all agree that, when we do the work for them, we do it as well as anybody in the industry. And so, we're seeing more and more of a preference to use us, particularly on our own sites. There's a lot of advantages for the carriers, but it has to be profitable work for us too. And so that balance makes it a little bit more challenging. But my -- it is one of our internal goals, Nick, that you're touching on to diversify our revenue base in that business because I think it's important to do and I think it's something we can accomplish.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. That's good to hear. Second, unrelated topic, Brendan, you had mentioned a step-up in the rate of new builds in '25. Can you share anything about the kind of initial development yields that you're expecting with those builds? And should we think of the change in the cadence as basically being attributable to Millicom as opposed to other factors?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I mean, the Millicom deal is definitely a big driver of that. It's by far the biggest driver of that. I mean, we've got -- I mentioned in the script that we had approximately 800 new builds we expect to do this year. That's what's implied in our outlook and in the discretionary CapEx. Most of that, say, ballpark close to 500, it would be Central America as part of the Millicom deal. So, that's definitely the biggest driver. But there are other markets as well. Tanzania is another market where we're building a lot of sites. So, it's concentrated in certain markets. But the ones that we're doing are very good. We feel really good about the yields on those day one. They don't require a ton of lease up, but I do think there's a lot of good opportunity for lease up in a number of these situations. So, it's a positive contributor and I think will help our return on invested capital that we report as we start to get into them and get them done.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, great. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Our next caller is David Barden from Bank of America.
David Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So, Brendan, Brendan Carr has been a vocal proponent of kind of changing the BEAD program to incorporate a little bit more flexible technological approaches to achieving some of these broadband goals, and fixed wireless access has been one of them. This has been a question we've been dealing with on the other side of the equation, which is how does it affect the wireline providers. I'm interested to hear your perspective on the extent that anyone has been phoning in asking SBA, could you help me figure out a way to address fixed wireless access as a BEAD solution? That'd be one question. And then, the second question is, another big question that's kind of arisen, subsequent to DISH kind of refinancing itself and getting $5 billion in capital, the question was, what were they going to do with that money? Were they going to use it to invest in handsets and marketing? Were they going to try to get to their build out requirements? And, obviously, that build out requirement extension that they just got from the Rosenworcel FCC is under threat. And I'm interested to know if there's some change in the conversation around how DISH might factor into your thinking in tower demand for the next couple of years? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. Okay. Well, there's a lot there, David. On the...
David Barden: Sorry.
Brendan Cavanagh: No, that's alright. On the BEAD program, I guess the short answer is no. I've not -- we've not really heard much from folks who are looking to us to try and help them with fixed wireless access as a BEAD solution per se. What we are, as I think, well, in my opinion and I think others would agree with this, that it was obviously a very fiber-oriented program. And I think expanding it out to cover more than just fiber to consider wireless as a solution is a good thing, and we would be very supportive of that. So, I do think that it could be good if, in fact, it goes that direction. But it feels a little early on that, there's been it's pretty far down the road in terms of a lot of the money being out the door and what the plans are. So, I'm not sure how much, of an impact we'll see from that, but I have some -- little bit of -- little glimmer of hope that it is, a favorable contributor for us, and we certainly are supportive of that. On the DISH side, when I think about the impact to us over the coming years, I think I mentioned in response to an earlier question that, we don't expect a whole lot of contribution this year. And that's really because we're just not seeing that much from them. They've been much quieter. I think that they have a lot to do, and when we have conversations with our network folks, it sounds like they have a lot of plans around that. But I think the extra time that they received for these build outs has given them the sense that they can take a little bit more time and focus on their financial house. if it's under threat and that change, I guess, we'll see what that does. If that, in fact, is the case. I'm not sure about that. But, at this stage, it's pretty slow with them. So, we'll see, and we're hopeful that it'll pick up. We have a very good relationship with them. We have a lot of existing embedded leases, and I think there's a lot that we can do together, as soon as they kind of get clarity on their plans over the next couple of years.
David Barden: All right. Thanks, Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: All right. Up next is Ari Klein from BMO Capital Markets.
Ari Klein: Thank you. Maybe just going back to the international churn, curious to see the level you're expecting in 2025. Do you think that that's going to be the peak? And do we need to kind of move past the churn you're seeing to kind of see leasing start to accelerate in international markets or can they kind of be separate from one another?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I mean, unfortunately, Ari, I don't actually think that it's the peak. I don't think it's necessarily going to be higher, but I do think that next year is likely going to be at a similar level to this year in terms of international churn. But its impact in terms of organic growth overall, obviously, it weighs on it, but there is -- different markets have different dynamics right now going on. I mean, we've got a lot happening in Central America and in Africa and Tanzania specifically, and I think we will see not only a lot of new build activity like we're working on, but we will actually see reasonably good lease up in those markets. And in many cases, particularly in Central America, we're pretty much through the churn, the consolidation churn. A lot of it has happened at this point. And so, we'll start to see that pullback. It's really Brazil, which is we're obviously heavily indexed to Brazil. So, as Brazil goes, that kind of is the deciding factor for a lot of these things. And I think Brazil probably has another year beyond this year at least where things will be a little bit challenging on that front.
Ari Klein: Thanks. And then, just maybe on share repurchases, how should we think about that? Are those likely to be on hold until the Millicom deal is completed? Or is it kind of in the independent of that and how you're thinking about it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I'd say it's somewhat independent of it. Obviously, we know that we have that commitment, that we have approximately $1 billion of capital that we are obligated to pay out. And as I mentioned earlier, the timing of that, hopefully, will be earlier than what we put forth. That's what we're shooting for if we can make it happen. And if it is earlier, that means we have to have that ready and available, which we do, but it does influence our thinking a little bit. However, having said that, we typically have run our share buyback program and I expect it to be the same for the time being in a somewhat opportunistic manner. And so, if we don't see other things going on and we see an opportunity where we think there's a meaningful dislocation that happens that doesn't make any sense to us, we may react more quickly to that.
Ari Klein: Thank you.
Operator: All right. Moving on to Brendan Lynch from Barclays.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Another follow-up on the government policy. Can you talk about the potential for more spectrum auctions over the next couple of years? And if you're having any conversations with customers on how that would inform their intentions and how you can support them?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So, obviously, that's one of the things that's being talked about by the new FCC that we are extremely favorable on and are very supportive of, as, of course, are the wireless MNOs here in the US. And so, I am hopeful that we will actually see an acceleration to improve the likelihood of having more spectrum auctioned off. But having said that, even if that is the case, with the current delay that's taken place and the time it will take to get to that and then ultimately for it to be cleared and available for deployment, you're talking about a number of years, off into the future. And so, conversations that we have with our customers are less about what they'll need to do with potential new spectrum years from now. It's more about how do they optimize and maximize what they have today that they either still have to deploy or that they can maybe redesign a little bit in order to maximize what they're able to produce with the current holdings. So that's the more immediate thing, and that's the type of thing that we would discuss rather than around future auctions at this stage.
Brendan Lynch: Sure. That makes sense. And another issue, you're selling the portfolio in Colombia. Should we expect you to exit additional markets throughout this year, or is that process pretty much complete at this point?
Brendan Cavanagh: No. I mean, it's not our intention to necessarily exit additional markets. In fact, as I mentioned, I think in my comments, we much prefer to not do that and to find ways towards improved scale and better positioning with the leading carriers in those markets. So that's what we're focused on. But having said that, in some cases like we did in Colombia, and like we did in the Philippines, if we come to the conclusion that we don't see a reasonable viable path to getting there anytime soon, then for purposes of being focused with our operations and where we are spending our time and energy, we would consider it. But it's not currently something that we have in the hopper.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thank you for the color.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: All right. That was our last caller in the queue. [Operator Instructions] All right. Looks like there are no further questions at this time. That concludes the SBA fourth quarter 2024 results conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA Communications Third Quarter Results Conference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you. Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, October 28, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page on Investor release on website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to comment on the third quarter.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. Operationally, the third quarter ended up rolling out largely as we expected, with leasing results in-line with our outlook and services results a little ahead of our outlook. Foreign exchange rates were a little stronger than our estimates a quarter ago, and domestic new carrier activity was up from the first half of the new year. All of these items combined to allow us to increase our full year 2024 outlook across all of our key financial metrics. In the US, new business executions were up from the prior three quarters. And applications and inquiries have increased as well. We are beginning to see a shift in the makeup of our new business signed up and applications with a growing percentage coming from new lease [co-locations] (ph) versus amendments to existing leases. We anticipate this trend continuing into 2025. All of our major customers have significant network needs over the next few years as mobile network consumption continues to grow at a healthy pace. The limitation of new spectrum availability over the next several years will challenge our customers to meet the demands on their networks through incremental equipment deployment and densification of sites. Our macro tower portfolio should be a beneficiary of this dynamic. Other growth drivers, which we have discussed before, such as fixed wireless access, the incorporation of new generative AI capabilities into handsets, regulatory build-out commitments and remaining 5G coverage expansion will all contribute to a healthy network investment environment over the next several years. In addition, our customer relationships are strong. We are a trusted and valued partner to each of them. We are very focused on helping them to achieve their objectives through providing exceptional service and quality. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we are in the business of long-term assets and long-term customer relationships. Things don't change much from quarter-to-quarter, but consistently delivering over time, as we have done for the past 35 years, is the best way to be our customers' first choice provider and ultimately, to maximize growth for our shareholders. Internationally, we have adopted the same philosophy. And as a result, we are seen as a valued partner to our carrier customers in each of our largest markets. The quarter was solid with international leasing results in-line with our expectations, and we expect a solid finish to the year. The broader market internationally though, still presents some challenges as we manage through customer consolidations and network rationalization. However, we see light at the end of this tunnel as the surviving customers are stronger and better positioned to invest in growing their wireless product offerings and their ARPUs. To accomplish this, increased network investment will be required, 5G upgrades across all of our international markets are really just at the very beginning. And wireless broadband consumption is growing across our markets just as fast, if not faster, than the US. Overall, we believe our International business will continue to be additive to our organic growth profile over time and the long-term prospects are still very good. As part of maximizing the long-term prospects of our International business, we continue to strategically review our operations and future potential in each of our existing markets. As I have shared with you before, we believe that in order to create the longest -- the greatest -- excuse me, long-term stability and the opportunity to maximize growth in a particular market, it is important to be of scale and positioned as an industry leader in that market and to be closely aligned with the leading wireless carriers in the market as well. In alignment with that effort, we are very pleased to share with you today's announcement of a purchase agreement signed with Millicom International Cellular, for the acquisition of over 7,000 sites throughout Central America, for an initial cash purchase price of approximately $975 million. Pro forma for this transaction, SBA will be the largest tower company across the region. We are very excited to increase our partnership with Millicom and to help them grow their business for many years to come. The assets are located across five countries in Central America, increasing SBA scale in four of those countries where we already have operations. The assets are anticipated to produce approximately $129 million in site leasing revenue and $89 million in tower cash flow during the first full year of operations after closing. And significantly all of the cash flow will be denominated in US dollars. Millicom will be a tenant on each site under a leaseback arrangement in which they have committed to an initial 15-year term. In addition, as part of the leasing arrangement, Millicom has agreed to extend all of their approximately 1,500 existing leases with SBA that exist on our existing assets in the region for a new 15-year term. SBA and Millicom have also entered into a new build-to-suit agreement under which SBA will exclusively build up to 2,500 new sites in Central America for Millicom over the next seven years. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and we expect it will close sometime in mid- to late 2025. The Millicom transaction demonstrates one way in which we are carrying out the learnings from our strategic review of each market, increasing our scale in existing markets and establishing long-term relationships with the leading customers in those markets. In some markets, however we may conclude this type of opportunity is not available to us. In those cases, we will consider divesting markets where we are subscale. One example of this is in the Philippines. Our original strategy in the Philippines was to gain scale through build-to-suit arrangements with local carriers and continue to grow our portfolio through organic growth, smaller acquisitions and further builds. Unfortunately, over the past two years, the market has changed, with the leading carriers awarding large build-to-suit opportunities to tower companies as a component of significant sale-leaseback transactions with those tower companies at very high valuations. We have successfully built a valuable portfolio of tower assets in the Philippines. But today, there are over 30 independent tower companies in the market, and our market share is still less than 1%. Given our lack of broader presence in the region and a limited path to scale over the near to medium-term, we have begun a process to exit the market through a sale of our existing business. We will continue our strategic review of all of our operations and markets with a focus on stabilizing long-term cash flows and positioning ourselves to maximize organic growth opportunities in each market. Some markets may grow and others we may exit, but I am confident that each decision will strengthen SBA's prospects for the long-term. Pivoting now to our services business, we had a very good third quarter. Revenue was up over 23% from the second quarter and gross profit was up over 33%. Our carrier customers meaningfully stepped up their construction activity in the quarter, contributing to better results than we had anticipated. As a result, we have increased our full year outlook for services revenue from the outlook provided last quarter. And our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook also benefited from these strong results. Our services teams continue to execute very well, and they provide a true differentiation for SBA with our customers. During the third quarter, we also made significant progress in managing our balance sheet. With three very positive capital markets transactions, which Mark will discuss in a moment. These transactions demonstrate our access to attractively priced capital and our position as a preferred issuer across the debt markets in which we participate. Our leverage remains near historical lows. We have one debt maturity over the next two years, and our $2 billion revolver is fully undrawn. So we are in excellent shape in terms of capital structure and liquidity. In addition, we continue a targeted approach to capital allocation. Completing our recent refinancing, which provides us with flexibility to opportunistically allocate capital into strategic and value-enhancing asset investment, with a key example being the Millicom transaction. During the third quarter, we also acquired a portfolio of high cash flowing sites in the US, at an attractive price and we will continue to look for opportunities to grow our asset base at appropriate valuations, as well as to opportunistically repurchase our stock. Our business continues to perform well, and our customers continue to enhance their networks. As a result, we are set up well for a strong finish to the year. Before turning it over to Mark to share more specifics on our third quarter results, I'd like to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. Our operations teams deserve a special thank you for the tremendous job they did through the recent hurricanes affecting the Southeastern United States. Between the two storms, we had over 1,000 sites in the path of one or both storms. Our sites once again demonstrated their resiliency with relatively little structural damage. More impressive, though was the quick and dedicated response from our team members to assess the damage, clear access and assist our customers in getting their networks up and running as quickly as possible. I greatly appreciate the dedication and commitment of our teams on the ground in these challenging situations. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark who will provide additional details.
Marc Montagner: Thank you, Brendan. Our third quarter results were mostly in-line with our expectations. Third quarter domestic same tower revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 5.3% on a gross basis and 2% on a net basis, including 3.3% of churn. Of that 3.3%, 2% was related to Sprint consolidation. International or same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.1% net, including 4.3% of churn or 7.4% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see solid organic lease-up in our international market. Total international churn remained elevated in the third quarter to mostly to previously announced carrier consolidation. Pro forma for today's announcement with Millicom, approximately 80% of cash site leasing revenue and 84% of adjusted EBITDA are expected to be denominated in US dollars. Let's now cover our results outlook for 2024. Even excluding the impact of better-than-expected foreign currency exchange rates in the third quarter, we increased our full year outlook across all key metrics, including site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and FFO per share as compared to our prior outlook. With regard to site development revenue, we increasing the full outlook by $5 million to mostly to strong third quarter outperformance in that business. Please also note that the outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those which as of today or under contract and expected to close by year-end. We also do not assume any share repurchase beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets or share repurchase or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expenses and for FFO and AFFO per share now assume the recent ABS financing and repricing of our term loan B. Additionally, we enter into a new [forward starting] (ph) interest rate swaps starting in April 2025. It will have no impact on our 2024 outlook. We are quite busy with our balance sheet in the last 2 months. During the third quarter, the company issued, through an existing trust, 2 tranches of tower revenue securities totaling $2.07 billion. This includes a tranche of $620 million issued at 4.654% with an anticipated repayment rate of October 2027 and the final maturity date of October 2054. The also includes a tranche of $1.45 billion issued at 4.831% with an anticipated repayment date of October 2029 and a final maturity date of October 2054. The net proceeds from the offering we used to repay the $620 million total maturity and will be used to pay back the $1.165 billion ABS maturing in January of 2025. Cash proceeds to repay the January maturity will sit in an escrow account until then, at which time, the $1.165 billion will be repaid. Our next maturity is a $750 million ABS during January 2026. Let me now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Marc. In September, we repriced our $2.3 billion term loan by lowering the spread above one-month term SOFR from 200 basis points to 175 basis points. This improvement represents approximately $6 million of annual interest expense savings. In addition to lowering the spread on our term-loan by 25 basis points, we also further hedge the future floating rate component of the loan by entering into a forward-starting interest rate swap. This swap will fix the otherwise floating one-month term SOFR at 3% for a notional amount of $1 billion, significantly lower than today's current one-month term SOFR rate. Similar to the existing $1 billion forward-starting interest rate swap we entered into back in the fourth quarter of 2023. The new swap has an effective start date of March 31, 2025, and a maturity of April 11, 2028. Together, the blended one-month term SOFR rate, we will pay starting in March 2025 on $2 billion notional will be 3.45 -- excuse me, 3.15% and inclusive of the new spread of 175 basis points, the all-in cost for the $2 billion fixed portion of the $2.3 billion outstanding term loan will be 5.165%, starting in April of 2025. The remaining unhedged portion of the loan will continue to float and accrue interest at one month term SOFR, plus 175 basis points. Pro forma for the new swap, approximately 98% of our non-revolver debt outstanding is fixed, which will reduce the impact of future interest rate fluctuations and create greater certainty in our future AFFO. Our current leverage of 6.4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains near historical lows. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a very strong 5.3 times. Pro forma for the ABS refinancing, our weighted average maturity is approximately four years with an average interest rate of 3.2% across our total outstanding debt. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, our $2 billion revolver is fully paid down. And finally, during the third quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $105.3 million or $0.98 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.98 per share payable on December 12, 2024, to shareholders of record, as of the close of business on November 14, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15%, over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2023. And operator, with that, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of -- excuse me, one moment. Batya Levi. Your line is open.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, domestically, you mentioned that carrier activity is increasing from the first half levels and shifting to more co-location versus amendment. Can you size that mix? And if this holds up into 4Q, how should we think generally about '25 leasing versus '24? Can it be flat to up? And on the Millicom deal, can you provide more color on the AFFO per share accretion in year one and maybe the lease-up opportunity on these sites? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. So on the carrier activity mix, we have seen an increase in carrier activity in the US in terms of new business signed up. The third quarter was higher than the first half of the year, really in the last three quarters, actually. And we would expect, based on the backlogs growing, that we'll continue to see that move up. It's not at levels of where it was during the height of a couple of years ago, but it's moving up in the right direction, and obviously that's favorable for the future. The mix of that shifting, we've begun to see, as I mentioned a little bit more of that revenue coming from new co-locations as opposed to amendments. We've had such a large percentage from amendments over time that now as we start to see more new leases, it's starting to shift a bit. And I guess what that really means is that we are obviously getting more points of presence with those carrier customers, which is a good thing for future growth as a big baseline. It does mean, I guess slightly on the negative side is that there is a little bit greater delay from when those leases, when that revenue gets signed up to when it commences, the amendments typically commence a little bit quicker. But if we continue to see something similar in the fourth quarter to what we saw in the third quarter, we'll be in okay shape for next year, but I can't really comment on how it will look relative to this year. There's a lot of moving parts. So we'll see where we are when we get there. As it relates to the Millicom deal, I think it is a little premature for me to give you the exact AFFO accretion. I think you can look at the numbers that we released in our press release in terms of the Tower cash flow, it will be because we are in many of these markets, there will be limited overhead increases associated with that. In addition, I would expect we'll have some income tax implications, but it definitely will be accretive to AFFO per share once it closes. The issue is really just the timing of when it closes is so, as we get a little bit further down the road and we have a better sense of timing, we'll share that more specifically with you, Bob, yes. You asked one other question, too, which I don't think I answered, which is about the lease-up potential on those sites. The current tenancy ratio on those sites is [1.2%] (ph), with 1 being Millicom’s leaseback, so they’re fairly under-penetrated in terms of co-locations, so we think that actually will set them up pretty well to see some nice growth in the future.
Batya Levi: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: And the next we’ll go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Ric Prentiss: Hi, good afternoon everybody. Hey, I'm glad you all made it through the hurricane okay, got the network stack up and running as a Florida based firm. We feel you there. Glad everybody is doing well. I want to follow-up to Batya's questions on the [Tigo] (ph) deal. Can you help us understand kind of maybe a rough magnitude of EBITDA? I know you said it would be limited added overhead. Just trying to get that an understanding. It looks like the multiple on tower cash flow was about 11 times for the initial payment. Just trying to get a sense of what the EBITDA multiple might have been ballpark.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I would expect that the incremental SG&A will be between $3 million and $5 million, Ric. So maybe half a turn or so higher on a multiple.
Ric Prentiss: Yes. So still something kind of in the sub-6 times probably for EV, the EBITDA multiple paid for the assets?
Brendan Cavanagh: No. It would be 11.
Ric Prentiss: Yes, right. [11.5%, so 12 like 11.5%] (ph)
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. So help us understand maybe a little bit more about why that price. Can you talk a little bit about the quality of the assets how robust are they as far as adding tenants? And then just what's the carrier universe like in each one of those markets and we can understand the leasing potential, given the multiple was kind of like [11.5 times] (ph)?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So Ric, first of all, we just kind of go to the overall premise, which I tried to lay out a little bit in my scripted comments, but we're operating throughout Central America today. We're one of the leading tower companies there. But as we kind of -- and I talked about this earlier in the year, as we kind of look through each of our markets and where we are operating, we -- tried to kind of say, what does the future look like? What's the potential look like for us? And we came pretty early on to the conclusion that you need to be a leader in the market in terms of your size and scale to be of the most relevance and importance of the carriers that operate there. And not only that, you needed to be aligned as closely as you could with the leading carriers in the markets so that you weren't as subject to some of the challenges that we faced when we've been indexed to maybe some of the weaker carriers in certain markets that we've been in, and it obviously has created churn and some disruption to the stability that this business is well known for. And so with that in mind, this was an opportunity to one, take a leadership position where we're clearly the largest, most dominant tower company across the region; and two to partner with the leading carrier across the region. So that was really the biggest driver. We could -- and the fact that we could do it at a price point that was good for us and good for Tigo, I think it worked very well. Obviously, it's a way for them to unlock value in assets that are not core to their operations. And for us, it's a way to make the most of our skill set, which is delivering these types of infrastructure assets at the highest quality and making them available not only to Tigo, but also to the other carriers in the region. Now when we look at the growth potential across the markets, we have a number of these markets, one of the good things about where we are today as we look forward is that many of them have already experienced the consolidation that kind of disrupted things for a little while over the last few years. And because of that, we feel very good about the remaining carriers in each of the markets. So, each one is a little bit different. Each country is a little different. Some only have two carriers that are fairly well balanced with Tigo being one. Others have more carriers than that. But the fact that there's only 1.2 tenants on these sites, and looking at where a number of them are located with Tigo as the leading provider in many of these markets, we believe it leaves a nice opportunity for some additional growth in the market.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. And any CapEx that's required kind of to get them up to handle that additional tenancy.
Brendan Cavanagh: There may be some, but that would obviously be figured into the analysis as we sign those leases with new carriers. So there is no required CapEx other than to the extent we see that it's appropriate in connection with the lease-up opportunity.
Ric Prentiss: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jim Schneider: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I guess first question would be relative to Millicom deal. Clearly, you're doubling down on the Central America footprint. What should we draw away from this in terms of anything you may say about or not about foreclosing the possibility of a larger out-of-footprint deal in Europe or elsewhere?
Brendan Cavanagh: I don't think that it necessarily means anything as it related to that. Our top priority was certainly to look at the markets where we already are operating and to improve our position in those or, frankly to look at exiting those if we don't see a clear path to doing that. But that in and of itself isn't a commentary on expansion into other places. I think the expansion in other places is simply secondary to strengthening the position in the markets where we already are.
Jim Schneider: Understand. And then in terms of the commentary on greater proportion of new leasing on the domestic sites, can you maybe just talk a little bit about qualitatively how much of that is sort of new leases in, say rural markets and sort of outside of urban, suburban areas? And are you seeing anything on the margin in terms of densification?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I’d say it's a little bit of both, Jim. I mean it's fairly early that we started to see this shift. We've really just seen an uptick in the sheer number of brand-new leases that we are signing relative to the pace we've seen over the last two years. So some of that is definitely in more rural markets as -- at least one of our customers has an initiative, regulatory requirement frankly, to build out some of those areas. So that's a part of it. But other parts of it are definitely densification as well in some of the more suburban markets. And I think it's our -- this is our best guess based on what we are seeing in the conversations we're having with our customers, but I expect both of those things to actually continue into the future, particularly given the lack of new spectrum that's going to be made available.
Jim Schneider: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brandon Nispel: Thanks for taking the question. Brandon, I'll try the leasing activity question a little bit away. I was hoping you could quantify the growth in lease applications in terms of the backlog of new leases that are signed but not commenced? And then Mark, just looking at the guide implied by 4Q leasing looks like something just shy of $9 million, is that the bottom? And when do you actually think there is an inflection in the leasing activity? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Brandon, I'm sorry to [hear this to you] (ph), but it was a little hard to hear you. I think you were asking about the organic growth and the timing of the inflection? Is it possible for you to just repeat it a little bit?
Brandon Nispel: Yes. I can try again. I was hoping you to take the activity question a little different direction and hoping you could quantify the application backlog in terms of signed but not commenced new leases. And then just looking at 4Q implied by guidance seems like new leases domestically is just shy of $9 million. Is that correct? And when is the bottom for that leasing metrics? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the application backlog is of a similar shift in mix that we talked about. Your number for the fourth quarter is pretty close, I would say within $0.5 million or so of what we estimate. And on the timing of the bottom, I think that's around it. I can't tell you for sure yet as we get into next year, but I think we would expect to see that sort of represent right around the bottom area. I mean some of that is dependent upon what we continue to see happen here as we move through the balance of the year in terms of leasing activity. The other caveat to that, the reason I'm hedging a little bit is just that shift in the mix of the lease-up has some impact on timing. The two different things they're obviously related. One is what we sign up and two is when does it commence and hit the financials and that shift in the mix to some degree, can push it out a little bit further. So until we see how that plays out for the balance of the year, it's hard for me to say exactly. But we're seeing an uptick in the overall leasing activity. So I'm pretty confident we'll start to see it move upwards.
Brandon Nispel : Great. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Simon Flannery: Hi, thank you very much. Good evening. I want to come back to the Millicom deal. You did a an additional build-to-suit agreement with them. Could you just talk about how you think about underwriting that return on investment and so forth, and it's a seven-year deal. So is that ratable over that time period? And then I think leverage stayed in the sort of mid-6s. How are you thinking about where you want leverage to go over the next year or two as you balance M&A and buybacks and keeping flexibility on the balance sheet? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. So yes, the build-to-suit agreement was actually a piece of it that we're very excited about because it allows us to continue to expand our partnership with Millicom basically what it is as we are their exclusive provider of build-to-suit opportunities over the next seven years up to a total of 2,500 sites. We underwrote that with as we looked at what we expected the estimated costs and the pricing of it was tied into those estimated costs. We expect it to be a high returner, certainly north of double digits without any lease up. And again, we think that there will be plenty of opportunities to see second tenancies on a number of those sites as we add them over time because they're typically going in locations where there isn't any coverage today. So I think it will be certainly additive over time. In terms of the timing of it coming in over that seven years, there isn't an expected time frame. It may come in evenly over that or it may come in quicker. So we'll just we'll report that as it progresses. So there's no requirement in that regard. On the leverage front, yes, our leverage is still hovering around the lowest level that it's been at for us historically at 6.4 times. Even with the Millicom deal pro forma for that, that's a fairly small impact. You're talking about 0.2 turns is what I'd estimate of incremental leverage when that eventually closes. So I don't really have the desire to necessarily see the leverage go lower. It's really more a function of good places to use the excess capital that it generates. This deal is an example of an opportunity that we saw, that we thought would be very value enhancing. And so having that flexibility to do that is a nice place to be. And that leverage being lower allows us the opportunity to do that. But going forward, we'll continue to look for places where we can invest in assets. And if we don't see asset opportunities, we'll invest in share repurchases. And that if doesn't seem like the best spot at a given time, we'll obviously continue to pay down debt. But my preference is to do one of the first-two.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jon Atkin: Thank you. A couple of questions. So as you manage your Latin American portfolio, my recollection is that you had somewhat of a centralized model doing a lot of it out of Florida. And is that still the case now that you've got a couple of quarters under your belt as CEO? And does the Millicom transaction change that at all?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, John, it's basically still the same. And really, what it is, is the things that can be done centrally, we try to do centrally, meaning back-office functions, accounting, HR, legal, those types of things. We obviously have to have a presence, of course in the markets for operational purposes, for sales purposes, interactions with our customers. those sorts of things. And we do have local representation of these other functions there. But we try to have everything kind of funnel back through our core systems here and our teams here. And the reason we do that is, one, it's cost effective. But two, it gives us a much greater insight into what's happening across all of our international markets by having it run that way. And three, it also allows us to have consistency across all these various markets and the way that we operate and the way that we approach our business. And I think, over time, that has generally benefited us relative to our peers. So I don't expect to change that going forward. And even with this Millicom deal, we'll obviously have to have a few more people in the field and maybe one or two more here. But I think the general structure will stay the same.
Jon Atkin: And then a couple of US questions. Just wondering if you're seeing any kind of different impacts or activity from some of the build to relocate tower development activities as well as any impacts that you might expect to see in the industry with a Verizon portfolio sale changing hands into an independent operation.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We're not really seeing too much on the relo stuff anymore. It was a little bit hotter a couple of years ago, but is largely died down. We see very limited situations for that. I think most people have come to realize that building towers next to other towers is kind of await to mutually assured self-destruction in those particular situations. So we're seeing a lot less of that. In terms of the Verizon sale, yes, I mean there was a nice -- that was a nice sized portfolio here in the US, there's obviously very few portfolios of that size available in the U.S. market and it looks like it went for a very nice price, which I think is representative of the value of towers here in the US, and we think is supportive of the fact that SBA has a very high-quality, high-value platform and portfolio.
Jon Atkin: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Richard Choe with JPMorgan.
Richard Choe: Hi, I wanted to ask about the site development. The revenue picked up and the guidance was moved up slightly. Is that following that type of work following with the increase in co-location and new leases? Or is there something else going on there? And how should we think about it as we roll into next year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Richard, it is a little bit. We had actually a better quarter than we had anticipated when we gave guidance three months ago, which is why we're moving our outlook up for the year. And I would say a lot of that -- there's a couple of carrier customers that were particularly busy. And it does seem to be because of the shift to more new leases and the fact that actually, we're doing a lot more of the full term fee work than we used to. So there's a heavy construction component to it. That doing that heavy construction piece drives the total volume up even on the same number of agreements. So I do think that's one of the contributing factors. And I would expect, as we move into next year, we'd see the same types of drivers for it.
Richard Choe: Great. And you talked a little bit about domestic M&A, but you did have a smaller deal that you said was highly cash flow accretive. Do you think there's more of these smaller deals to come and build upon? Or is that -- is it just a one-off type thing?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Unfortunately, I would say it's somewhat limited. We do our best to look at everything that's available and the volume of opportunities in the US is somewhat limited, which is part of the reason that they go for such high valuations because the folks chasing them outnumber the folks, making them available for sale. But Yes. I mean we're going to continue to look, and I think every so often, we're going to find opportunities to jump in and take advantage of something where maybe somebody else has missed it or we see value unlock opportunities that others don't. But I do think unfortunately, it's more limited than I would like.
Richard Choe: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Matt Niknam: Hi, guys thanks for taking the question. Just to dovetail on some of the questions that have been asked around the US. Can you talk maybe a little bit more around what necessarily changed in 3Q that drove the uptick in activity? Was it one carrier in particular or more broad-based? And then maybe just a follow on to that. On the DISH front, any changes in activity and any thoughts you can offer up on some of the moves they've made of late. Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, the change in the third quarter, I would say it's more broad-based. But in any given quarter, one carrier can be a little more active than another. So I don't know that as I kind of look at the pieces of it here in front of me, I don't see too much to highlight and we don't really like to get into the individual customers. I'm not sure that it would mean anything in anyway because the next quarter, that shift can turn around a little bit and just be a different carrier. It all depends on when they're hitting our specific sites, I think. With regard to DISH, obviously some positive news that I think sets us up well for the future, just the fact that one of our key customers, they have a lot to do. The fact they got some relief on the regulatory deadlines. I think it is clearly positive because it allows them to actually be able to achieve this build-out that they seem very, very committed to. And the funding that they've raised through the sale of satellite business, I think is also obviously positive. It's really just a question of timing. What they've done here is they've -- they've raised the funding, they've got themselves a schedule that they can work with, but I do think it will take some time for them to go through that and so it's a little early for me to know what the short-term impacts will be, but I do know long-term, it's obviously very positive.
Matt Niknam: Great. If I could just throw one more follow-up. In terms of colo relative to amendment in the US, what's the mix now? And how does -- I mean because you mentioned more of a mix of colo, but I'm just curious, at least in the third quarter, what that mix was in the US.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. And this is based on dollars, but it was roughly 60%, a little over 60% from new leases.
Matt Niknam: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.
Nick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, a couple of clarifications on Millicom. The Millicom press release highlighted the potential for them to get earnouts over time if you meet certain financial milestones. Are those likely -- would they need material to the purchase price? And from a churn perspective, is it fair to say that the 15-year MLA kind of locks Millicom in without any opportunity to get off any of the towers over time?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, on the second one. It's a 15-year committed term. On the first question on the earnout, there are some potential earn-outs for them. Those would only be paid if certain financial milestones were reached and that would be actually a great win for both parties. I don't think it materially will change the numbers, and it actually will be certainly enhancing to the overall multiple of the deal, if it happens.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Okay. And then you cited a deal with a nice yield on it that you closed. I think you're referencing the Televisa Univision deal. Can you share anything about the expected contribution there or the degree to which that thesis is based on the existing broadcast revenue stream versus potential lease-up? And how big is share of your business of broadcast today?
Brendan Cavanagh: Broadcast is a fairly small percentage of our business. We have some existing embedded broadcast towers that we've had for a lot of years in our portfolio. This particular portfolio was something that we spent a number of months with them on looking at each site and what its potential was. Obviously, the price point is well below where the typical wireless towers are trading here in US. So that allows for a lot more flexibility in terms of what we needed to do from an organic growth standpoint. But we do think some of the sites have potential for some growth, but it doesn't really require much. And we have a long-term commitment from Univision on that leaseback.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Great, thanks Brendan.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. One moment please. And your line is open.
Eric Luebchow : Could you maybe touch on kind of how not you see non-Sprint churn in your domestic markets looking beyond this year? I think you've talked about getting that down to below 1% range. But any update on kind of timing to when you guys think you could get there?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think that -- and guys are correct me if I'm wrong, I believe we were -- for this quarter, it's at about 1.3%, the non-Sprint churn. So it's already down into the lower ones. And I think it will probably improve from there. So I think that next year, I would expect that we're going to get somewhere close to 1% or so. So it continues to dwindle in terms of overall numbers and impact.
Eric Luebchow : Got you. Good to hear. And then just a follow-up on the Millicom MLA. You noted it's mostly US dollar-denominated, but any kind of color you can provide on kind of the escalator structure whether are those fixed? And are the new leases with more comprehensive or holistic in nature? Or will that growth be more subject to their kind of future activity levels, just kind of comparing it with what we typically see in the US. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I can't get into too much detail on all the -- first of all, on the dollar piece, the MLA is 100% US dollars, are referenced to significantly all the cash flow has to do with a few other small oddball things mostly around expenses. But the MLA is all in US dollars. And it's got all of the typical things you would see there are escalators in it, but I'd rather not get into all the detailed structure on that, if I can avoid it.
Eric Luebchow : Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed Partners.
Walter Piecyk: Can you just refresh my memory on how long it does take from order to implementation for colo? I know you said it obviously takes longer than amendment, but just kind of a ballpark number of months.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I'd say ballpark, six months, Walt.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. So if the order flow is kicking in now, but obviously, that revenue should kick in in conjunction with the capital plans for these operators in 2025. And then on the dividend, obviously, you stated what you're doing in the fourth quarter. Last year, the growth was 20% this year. It's -- it was 15% it sounds like the outlook in terms of growth might be a bit better, maybe not. But is the expectation to -- when you look at the investor base out there that's available to you on the yield side. Is there kind of like a floor that you think about in terms of growth in the dividend year-over-year as we contemplate '25 and '26?
Brendan Cavanagh: Not explicitly. I would expect that we will be certainly the fastest-growing dividends within our small industry here. And one of the fastest among REITs broadly. It is 15% this year, which is the lowest it's been actually at any point in our history. Obviously, we're starting with relatively small numbers, so the percentage growth can be higher. Part of it, Walt is that we're triangulating a little bit towards our REIT obligation. We have NOLs that we've been burning off. And so we've been able to use those as kind of a supplement to limit us from having to pay the full REIT dividend. But as we burn those NOLs, that starts to kind of lock in more and more what our number needs to be. But I would expect -- I don't really want to jump ahead because we are going to look at our dividend increase next quarter that we typically do it with our fourth quarter earnings. But I would expect it will still be a very healthy growth relative to the rest of the industry.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.
David Barden: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And apologies to ask when tower companies do something new and exciting, we have to ask about it. So I'll have to ask about the Millicom deal. Brendan, the Millicom, I think, is operating in nine markets in Central America and you guys bought, I think, 5. Is there some sort of potential that there's something more that's going to evolve out of that? Or can you explain a little bit more about why you bought -- what you bought and didn't buy what you didn't buy. And then I guess another question for the Marks is, if I'm kind of reading this right, you've kind of swung from a worldview where having a 15% to 20% variable rate debt portfolio was the right mix. Now you're 98% of non-revolver is fixed. Can you talk a little bit about why you chose now to make that decision? And you had a lot of activity in the quarter. A lot of it had to do with the $2.3 billion term-loan expiring in 2025. Are there more moves to make? Or is this kind of the balance sheet that SBA is going to have for the next 12, 24 months that we can come just kind of chew on and put into our models? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: So on the Millicom markets, We -- I believe, bought every market that they operate in, in Central America. I think when you're referring to their extra markets, you're including South American markets, David. And so what we focused on is the places where we had operations and frankly, where we have a good size presence and this was a meaningful enough transaction to put us in a much stronger go-forward position. Some of the markets where they operate, we are not currently in some of those markets and others were well below scale and it didn't really seem like it was going to change things. And it was actually a much cleaner separation to Central America versus South America. There's nothing that you should read into that in terms of future additional items. This was one specific deal and it stands on its own merits. And then your other question on the debt, which Mark you can take if you want, but I don't think there's any change, though, in our philosophy. As you mentioned the fixed versus floating, as though it was a change. We actually already had hedges in place for the vast majority of our floating debt. Sometimes it changes because of the amounts outstanding on the revolver, which is obviously floating. And part of the reason is 98% is because there's zero outstanding on the revolver. But we already have most of our term-loan, which is the other floating instrument fixed today through hedges. And what we've done is enter into some forward starting hedges to continue that fixing to provide some certainty. And we did that more to be opportunistic around the rate environment that we saw locking in rates that were materially below where the rates are today will require significant reductions in rates. And so it's really to provide the certainty but also to take advantage of what we thought were actually pretty good rates. I don't know Mark, do you want to add anything?
Marc Montagner: No, I think the existing hedge on the term loan for $1.95 billion expires in April of 2025. So we just put -- two new hedges in place $1 billion each one a few months ago at 3.8%. And another one on the cap at 3% that we did last month. So the average -- or the max interest rate on SOFR now for the $2 billion of the term loan B would be 3.41%, and SOFR is at 4.7% now. So I think we just took advantage of a debt in interest rate to locking a cap on the max interest rate we're going to pay on the term loan B, starting in April of '25.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean they're really just replacements of what existed when they're set to expire. And I think going forward, you asked a question about whether the balance sheet looks the same here for the next 12 months or so, I mean we only have one maturity during the next 24 months, and that's in January of 2026. And frankly, it's only $750 million, which is really not that much can be managed in many different ways. So I think the answer to that question is yes, David. It's going to stay very much similar to what you see today. The only caveat to that is other opportunities that come along that will require some shift in the way we're capitalized to take advantage of them. But otherwise, you should expect it would be the same.
David Barden : Okay, great. Thank you guys.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Mike Rollins with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Michael Rollins: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Two, if I could. First, as you're seeing more opportunity and leasing from your carrier customers does that increase the likelihood that you would enter into new multiyear comprehensive deals with additional domestic national wireless carriers. And then second, philosophically, how are you looking at updating escalators in the domestic business when you have renewal opportunities with your customers? Do you still prefer a fixed long-term rate? Or just given some questions of inflation and future rates, are you considering taking a CPI-based approach with possible floors and ceilings? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So -- we have -- as you know, we already have a comprehensive MLA that we signed with AT&T about 15 months or so ago. So that is already set in place and isn't really impacted by what's happening. Now I think as we have continuing the conversations with our other customers, if we can find a way to agree on things that work for both parties that our comprehensive nature, we're open to doing that. In either case, I would expect us to have, what I'll call, regular MLAs, meaning things that define the overall merits of the relationship, they don't necessarily have to be the all-you-can-eat structure. That really just depends on if it's something that works for what their needs are in the short term and what we think is the best way to monetize value. So I don't really know. Honestly, Mike. We'll continue to talk to our customers and whatever structure works the best for both parties is what we'll go with, but we don't have a disposition towards trying to do more of those. In terms of the escalators, they don't really change much because even when we negotiate new agreements sometimes, we'll look at what the escalator will be for the brand new co-locations that they sign. We don't touch the ones that are in the embedded base, and that's obviously the bulk of our business. So there's little impact on the base escalators. For the new ones, we will discuss it, but we usually end up focusing on a fixed rate as opposed to a CPI. But really that's a matter of just negotiation on each individual case.
Michael Rollins: Thanks very much.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of quick ones on Millicom. The first release alluded to 7,000 communication sites. Can you talk about the mix of towers versus rooftops? And then also on the tenancy ratio being [1.2] (ph). Can you talk about whether Millicom was pursuing a strategy of co-location or perhaps they were trying to avoid, leasing to some of their competitors to maintain a competitive advantage in some of these areas?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the vast majority of these are towers and even the ones that are rooftops, which is a fairly small percentage are typically towers on rooftops. So it's basically all effectively towers. I don't know the exact number off the top of my head. I think it's somewhere around 90% is ground-based towers and the other 10% to 12% or so is rooftop based. And then on the tenancy side, the Millicom did have these in a -- they had established a tower company entity that they called [LOGI] (ph) . That's where these towers resided. And the intention was to lease space on them to other parties with so they did do some, efforts around that. However, it's our belief that a number of these sites were held back because they were better sites and therefore, for competitive reasons for the wireless business. They did not make them available. And even in other cases, competing carriers, we're not as inclined to go on the sites when they're owned by one of their competitors. So we do think there's an opportunity to unlock lease-up value here.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of David Guarino with Green Street Advisors.
David Guarino: Thanks. I just want to go back to that earlier question about the earn-out because it's really helpful for figuring out the valuation you paid. So I know in your SEC filings, you disclosed potential obligations on prior transactions, but those don't end up being shown up on your balance sheet. So I guess as we kind of think about when the deal closes, should we assume that line item in your queue is going to increase materially? Or is the earnout not that material? And then also just an idea of the time frame for when those earnouts would be payable? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I don't think it is going to change on our balance sheet. There may be some disclosure around potential earn-outs, but honestly David, the deal was just signed today, so I'm not 100% sure what the disclosure will look like in our financials, but we'll -- that's something that maybe our guys could look at that and just give with you off off-line on that. In any case, it's not that material to the overall picture. So I think even if you see what it might look like, I don't think it's going to -- it's not going to change the way that the deal looks. And as I said, to the extent that anything is paid, it will actually be a success because it means that we've added more revenue than perhaps we even expected.
David Guarino: Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
Brendan Cavanagh: Colin, I think we're probably ready – I think we’ve already used up our allotted time. So I just want to thank everybody for joining the call, and we look forward to catching up with you next quarter to share our year-end results.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our teleconference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, VP of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Executive Officer, and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, July 29th, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, some of our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package which is located on the landing page of our investor relations website. With that, I'll now turn it over to Brendan to comment on the second quarter.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon. The second quarter was another solid one with good execution operationally and financial results in line with our expectations. Accounting for recent weakening in foreign exchange rates, we have modestly lowered our full-year outlook for most financial measures. However, on a constant currency basis, we have slightly increased our projected full-year results. The year has largely unfolded as we had expected. Steady carrier activity across our markets, but no material inflection in new lease and amendment executions thus far into the year. In the US, we have continued to receive increased inquiries from our customers, which is a good sign, but to date we have only seen a modest increase in new business executions. Looking out over the next several years though, we are very excited about the prospects for further increased demand. Mobile network consumption continues to grow at a very healthy pace, adding strain to existing networks. The offering of fixed wireless access by all three of our major customers will only add to this network strain. I have mentioned it before but I believe it bears repeating. The average fixed wireless access user consumes 15 to 25 times the data that a typical mobile wireless user consumes. As a result, the equivalent mobile subscriber additions to our customers networks is significantly higher than it has been in the past. This phenomenon will require continued network investment by our customers to keep pace with the demand. And all have publicly discussed plans to continue to grow fixed wireless access subscribers over the next several years. We also expect that the eventual incorporation of new Generative AI capabilities into handsets will further increase network consumption. In addition, the percentage of our existing leases with the big three carriers that have been upgraded with mid-band 5G spectrum still remains at just over 50%, leaving a significant growth opportunity ahead of us. Varying rates of 5G progress among our largest customers creates competitive pressures that we believe will also be a driver of future network investment, just as it has been in past cycles. Incidentally, mid-band 5G spectrum upgrades in our international markets are at even lower percentages of completion than in the US. Beyond all these demand-oriented drivers, we expect increased network spending driven by 5G coverage commitments made in connection with past regulatory approvals. Some of these commitments not only require coverage of POPs, but also minimum downlink speeds. This means that denser buildouts and expansion into areas not previously prioritized, particularly rural areas, will become more important as deadlines approach. We believe we are well situated to assist our customers in meeting their objectives with both our assets and our services support solutions. We are in the business of long-term assets and long-term customer relationships. Things don't change materially overnight, but the signs of numerous demand drivers are all there, and we are confident in our long-term organic growth prospects. In our services business, we had another good quarter as well. Revenue was up 15% from the first quarter and our gross profit contribution was ahead of our internal expectations. We have lowered our full year outlook for services revenue by $10 million at the midpoint due to a lower anticipated level of construction work, although we still expect to increase that number in the second half of the year over first half levels. Notwithstanding this lowered revenue outlook, we have not reduced our expected gross profit contributions to our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook as we continue to secure higher margin work. Our services teams continue to perform very well for our customers, helping them to significantly reduce their deployment cycle times. Internationally, results were also in line with expectations in the prior quarter, although we did see a pick-up in new leasing activity during the quarter, increasing the contribution to full year revenue from new leases and amendments. Each of our markets has opportunities for increased organic growth as new spectrum and new generations of wireless technology are rolled out. Challenging macroeconomic factors and imbalanced market share among mobile network operators in some of our markets has led to consolidations and increased network rationalizations, presenting some near-term challenges, but ultimately bolstering the strength and sustainability of our customers' prospects. We continue to work toward enhancing our own market positioning and our alignment with the leading carriers in each of our markets. We believe our efforts will ultimately enhance the long-term strength and stability of our cash flows and increase our opportunities to capture incremental organic leasing revenue growth. During the second quarter, we also continued a balanced approach to capital allocation with a mix of portfolio expansion, stock repurchases, dividends, and debt reduction. I anticipate that we will continue to balance our capital allocation for the remainder of the year. Since our last earnings call, we have largely focused on debt reduction and have reduced our outstanding revolver balance to just $30 million as of today. We have some upcoming debt maturities that we anticipate refinancing in the near future. But until that time, we will likely continue to prioritize debt reduction and liquidity. The debt markets are wide open to us and have also improved over the last few months as we have seen some tightening of rates. Our quarter-end net debt to adjust to EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.4 times. So, while our current priority is debt reduction, we have preserved the flexibility to take advantage of material value enhancing investment opportunities if they arise. We continue to explore and stay educated about the numerous asset portfolios available throughout our markets, but we'll retain an informed financial discipline in our approach to these opportunities. Our approach has really not changed, but our increased cost of capital has certainly underscored the emphasis we place on precise valuation and strategic rationale. I still believe we are the best in the business at valuing, integrating, and operating tower assets. So I believe we can continue to create value through asset acquisitions. We have a great long-term steady cash flow, low-risk business. The underlying strength of wireless dependent products and services will continue to drive increased needs for enhanced infrastructure solutions, and we have positioned ourselves as a key partner for our customers in meeting the challenges of addressing those needs. Before turning it over to Marc to share some more specifics on our second quarter results, I'd like to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. With that, I'll now turn things over to Marc who will provide additional details.
Marc Montagner: Thank you, Brendan. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectation. Second quarter domestic same tower revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 5.9% on a gross basis and 2.3% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. $8.2 million of the second quarter churn was related to spring consolidation churn. International same tower recurring cash easing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 2.7% net, including 5.3% of turn, or 8% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.4% on a constant currency basis. As compared to the previous quarter and full year 2023, the reported international growth rate continued to be impacted by a declining local CPI link escalator in Brazil. We continue to see strong organic leads up in our international market. Total international returns remain elevated in the second quarter due mostly to previously announced carrier consolidation. During the second quarter, 79% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in US dollars. The majority of non-US dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. Let me now cover our revised outlook for 2024. Excluding the impact of weak foreign currency assumptions, we slightly increase our full outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, and FFO per shares compared to our prior outlook. The devaluation of the Brazilian real versus the US dollar is estimated to have a negative impact to our site leasing revenue of approximately $19 million in 2024 versus our prior forecast in May. With regard to site development revenue, we are forecasting lower construction volume for the full year and therefore have lowered our full year outlook by $10 million. However, we have not reduced expectations for gross profit contribution for this business as we continue to execute well and secure higher margin work. Please also note that the outlook does not assume any further acquisition beyond those as of today that are already under contract and expected to close by year-end. We also do not assume any share repurchase beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets or share repurchase or both during the year. Outlook for net cash interest expenses and core FFO and FFO per share now assume a September 1st refinancing of the $620 million ABS Tower Securities scheduled to mature in October 2024. We assume that we're financing at a fixed rate of 6% per year. Actual rate and timing may vary from these assumptions. As a result of this revised financial assumption and projected lower cash taxes, a full-year FFO per share outlook has increased by $0.09, excluding the impact of FX changes. Let me now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Marc. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity. Our current leverage of 6.4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains near historical lows. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remains very strong at 5.2 times. Our weighted average maturity is approximately four years with an average interest rate of 3% across our total outstanding debt. Including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate of 97% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, we have a $30 million balance under our $2 billion revolver. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $105.3 million, or $0.98 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.98 per share payable on September 18, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 22, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% of the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2023. And operator, with that we are ready to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess the first question, if I could, maybe either for -- I don't know who this question goes to. Just talking a little bit about the evolution of the financing market, there's been a lot of movement in the last few weeks. You guys took some steps to try to maybe pre-finance the term loan coming due in 2025. I'm wondering if you could kind of comment a little bit about what the landscape looks like and how the rates that you are being presented look relative to what they might have looked like a month ago? And then if I could, the second one is, just for our, just as a reminder, Marc or Brendan, when we think about how you guys choose to budget FX into your guidance, with the real blowing out to like BRL5.60, are you looking at forward rates? Are you looking at spot rates? How are you deciding what you're going to bake into guidance, which seems to be the biggest moving part in what happened this quarter? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I'll jump in first, David, and Marc can add in anything that he thinks I need to -- that I missed on the financing market. The market certainly has been improving. Obviously, there's a greater expectation in terms of rates. The next financing -- the refinancing that we have to do are of ABS debt that's outstanding. And we expect to do that with a like instrument and those instruments are typically priced as a spread to treasuries. So the improved general sentiment around forward rates affects the treasuries and that obviously is helpful to the potential pricing of those financing that we have ahead. But just beyond that, there's a high demand for the type of paper that we issue. And I think there's opportunity to see that continue to improve moving forward. As it relates to the term loan that we did before, it's floating rate, so really that didn't change much and we had a hedge in place. So obviously an improving rate environment will directly help that particular instrument, particularly when the hedge falls away next year. So on the second question regarding the FX forecasting, we typically will use as we go into the year, a forward market. We'll look at what are the general consensus of projections for that year, primarily around Brazil, around all of our foreign currencies, but Brazil is the biggest one. And we will usually pay it to that. Unfortunately, those projections have not turned out to be right thus far this year, and the currency has weakened much more than was originally expected. And the rate that we're using now for the balance of the year is pretty close to spot, which is also in line generally with projections, but obviously it's an inexact science. So we would prefer to try and nail it right on and not have to change it, but that's a hard task.
David Barden: Okay, great. Thank you for the color, Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. Good afternoon. First, on M&A, you put this comment in about taking advantage of material value, enhancing investment opportunities as they arise. Has something changed that you're looking more closely at that now, maybe given you get through some of this financing, or is it just consistent with where you've been before? And any thoughts around how you're thinking about geographies? I know you talked before about Europe being interesting, but is it mostly developed market or US and Europe or would you look at expanding and existing or new developing markets? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yeah. The comment about material value enhancing, obviously that's not different than what we've done in the past. I think the key difference now is that with our leverage having come down to a much lower place, actually the lowest place it's been in our history, it allows for flexibility that if we saw something of material size that we thought would be value enhancing to be able to transact that maybe easier than it would have been in the past. But our approach is not that different. Obviously, cost of capital is higher, and so that affects what we can pay or where we see value in terms of the opportunities that are out there. But it's our goal and intention to hopefully find opportunities that are creative and add other value, even strategic value in terms of positioning to the extent it's in international markets for example. And I think you should expect that we're constantly looking and that hopefully we will find those opportunities just as we've done in the past. In terms of the where, it really depends. I mean, mostly we're focused on the markets that we're in, but we kind of scour the globe and we look at everything that's available. We look at opportunities that are in markets we're not in, because sometimes we see things that we think will fit very well and will be long-term value creating. So there's not a specific target, but to the extent that we can add in markets where we already are, there's obviously some synergies associated with the operations around that.
Simon Flannery: And do you think we're getting to a better place between private and public multiples? Because it seems like they've been quite a spread there for a while.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think it's moving more in the right direction than it has in the past few years. Specifically internationally, I would say we're seeing that constrain meaningfully in terms of the difference between the twp. Domestically, it's probably less so, and I think that's mostly a function of just limited supply in the US. And obviously, it's kind of the prime tower market. But even in the US, I'm starting to see some indications that maybe that gap will narrow a little bit.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jim Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, could you maybe tell us how you're thinking about the various international markets where you have a presence already today? Any attractiveness of staying in markets where you arguably are subscale relative to getting bigger in ones where you already have a meaningful presence?
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yeah. As we mentioned it at the beginning of the year on our first call of the year about our approach, that we're doing a review kind of all of our not only our international markets but all of our business lines. But specifically as it relates to our international markets, what we've determined as we kind of look through it is it definitely is an advantage to be of greater scale, to be of more relevance to your customers in the markets that you're in. And in some places we are in that position, and in other places we are not. And so, to the extent that we can solve that issue through expansion in some of those markets, we would like to do that. If we do not see a reasonable way to do that, then we may look to move on from certain markets as we've done, at least with one in the past. So we're continuing through that exercise, and even though there's no real update on that at the moment, it's not because there's no progress being made, there is in fact a lot of progress being made, but we're not at a point to be able to discuss specifics yet, but we will be down the road. So ideally, we'll look to be able to have a good scale in each of the markets that we're in, and we'll also look to be aligned with the stronger carriers that are operating in those markets as well.
Jim Schneider: That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe as a follow-up, relative to the downtick in site development expectations for the year, I know that's not impacting the gross profit line because you're picking more profitable business, but can you maybe just comment on what that signifies in terms of domestic care activity, broadly speaking, and whether that's any kind of leading indicator of a more of your environment, or is that just you being selective in the business you're taking from them?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I don’t -- it's not really signifying much. It is -- the mix of work that we're doing is a little bit different. It's a little more oriented towards consulting or site development services type of business as opposed to construction. So the top line volume ends up being lower, but the margin ends up being higher on that. And our outlook, although it is lowered in total for the year, and that's really based on the first half of the year, honestly, we expect the second half of the year, and it's implied in the number, to be higher in terms of the volume than the first half of the year. So I wouldn't say that it's necessarily a sign of it being more muted. I think it's just the mix of work as much as anything.
Jim Schneider: Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I may. First, there are a few assets on the market in Europe right now. I'm just curious, at a high level, could you give us your thoughts philosophically on the European tower market? Maybe if you could compare and contrast the opportunities and headwinds for that market. And then my second question would be, just based on everything you're seeing domestically at the moment, do you believe we can see domestic new leasing in 2025 be up versus 2024 levels? And kind of, if not, when is the drop dead for us to see a pick-up in activity for it to really be reflected in 2025? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure, I just -- I'll do the second question first. I mean, we're obviously not in a position today to give outlook on 2025, so I don't really want to get into that too much. And so much of what ‘25 will look like is going to be based very heavily on what we see happen in the second half of ‘24. So I would say just hold tight and we'll see how that goes. If we don't see any real uptick in carrier spending in the second half of 2024, then it likely would not be up, but there's still a lot of that story to be written, so we'll see where it goes. On your first question on Europe, we obviously don't have any operations in Europe. So my views and opinions are based on just looking at it from the outside in. We've explored opportunities as they've come up in Europe. And I think the positives there are obviously you've got a very stable type of market in terms of currency, in terms of rule of law and regulations. It's very established. But it's also slow growth and I think there are some churn risks that exist there, particularly as you see carriers consolidating their network operations. And so, any decision to expand into Europe will be opportunity specific and dependent upon the valuation as much as anything and what we see as the specifics around that particular portfolio if we decide to go that route. So yeah, we look at everything that comes available as I said earlier and if we see something we'll explore it. And if we don't, then we're perfectly content where we're at.
Michael Elias: Great, thanks for the color.
Operator: And our next question comes from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Just wanted to ask on the leverage. It's continued to go down and it seems like it'll continue to trend that way given if there's nothing out in the M&A environment. How low could we see that leverage go to over the foreseeable future? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Well, it's not our intention to necessarily see it continue to go lower. That's really going to be a function of the alternative uses of capital. So I can't give you an exact number. I think depending on the opportunities that come along for investment into the business and to assets, that will be the main driver of where leverage goes. If we see an opportunity to expand in a way that we think will be value additive to us long term, then you may see leverage tick back up. If we don't see that, then leverage will probably continue to decline. Eventually, we'll have to explore what that means in terms of investment grade, but I don't think we're quite there yet.
Richard Choe: It seems like the opportunities have been a little bit slow in the first half of this year. Do you think things will pick up in the second half and as we go into next year?
Brendan Cavanagh: You mean opportunities for asset acquisitions?
Richard Choe: Yes.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I would not say that they are slow. I would say that nothing has been secured, certainly signed up or closed as of yet that’s of a major scale, but there are a lot of different portfolios and opportunities out there. So I think my M&A team would not agree with that it's slow because they've been very busy. But what that ends up resulting in will depend on whether we can find something we like in terms we find attractive.
Richard Choe: Great, thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.
Brendan Cavanagh: Hey, Ric.
Ric Prentiss: Hey. When you get quarters, like most recently, with the FX rate, does it cause you to pause a little bit and think, why are we so heavily involved in some of these international countries? Or how should we think about what moments like this when you have to pull down the guidance because of FX to David's questions earlier? How do you kind of square that with where you want to see the company go longer term?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think, Ric, it's a -- obviously, we have what we have. We have a big embedded business, particularly in Brazil, and it's got that risk, and we've seen it in past cycles, too. And, of course, it's disappointing to us to have to lower outlook based solely on that particular issue. I think it does impact or influence the way that we think about the mix of our asset base and our revenue base to have something that's a little more stable. I think at the beginning of the year when we were talking about our overall goals and the way that we look at things, stability was kind of a key point in that. And obviously, this particular item introduces an element of instability that I would prefer not to have. However, we have a very good business down there. There's a lot of good things that are going on in Brazil. And so trying to navigate through the right way to reduce that exposure probably comes through increased exposure in other places that perhaps have more stable currencies. So we'll see if we can do that but I would say that it at least influences us to not get too overextended to some of these currencies that have greater volatility.
Ric Prentiss: Makes sense. And you had a comment earlier that the US is still about 50% done on the mid-band deployment varies by carrier significantly possibly and international as well. Can you give us kind of a spot number? Where are the international markets on kind of that mid-band or 5G spectrum deployment?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I do have that and it does vary by market and I think maybe something we can share with you offline because I don't have it right in front of me. It's kind of a mix, but I would say, this is me ballparking it based on what I've seen for each country that we've got. You're looking at somewhere in the probably 25% or less on average across all of the existing international markets that we're in.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. And then Simon asked a question about public versus private multiples. Take that a little bit further. And what are the pros and cons of maybe selling a piece of your domestic business if private multiples stay above public multiples, i.e. American Tower did it with the Telxius European, did it with core data centers. So it's kind of a way to bring capital in, could be used to address the balance sheet. But kind of your thoughts, pros and cons on kind of that disparity between public and private and that maybe you could sell, buy high, sell low, kind of find a place to say, well, can we get [them mark] (ph) to market?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think that's never been a big part of our goal is to shrink through selling off assets. I think certainly, partnerships that bring in partners is a possibility that we would consider. But in terms of selling assets, I would say it's on the table, Ric, if in fact evaluations are just at a level that we believe is clearly well above the credit that we're getting for those assets, but there's a lot of logistics that we would have to work through as well. We obviously have financing structures, we have MLA agreements, we have a number of different things that would impact our ability to kind of hive off assets here in the US. But I wouldn't rule it out altogether. I just would say that it's not at the top of the list ideally.
Ric Prentiss: Makes sense. It's complicated, but something should be at least studied.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, and maybe just one other thought on that as I'm thinking about it. We always talk about the disconnect, and I think the inference is always that the disconnect is that the private multiples are too high, I might flip that around and suggest that the public multiples perhaps are too low. So it's not -- when it closes, which way it closes will obviously have an impact on how you feel about that sort of an exit.
Ric Prentiss: Exactly. I know we agree with that and that sometimes a mark to market wakes the public up to what the real value is. All right. Hey, appreciate it, guys. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: Thanks. Two questions. One, anything about the build-to-suit opportunity, given your recent run rate of domestic builds-to-suit, and anything that you see that might cause you to want to get a little more aggressive on that? And then on the leasing side, I think I heard you say increased interest, some of it due to mandated kind of rural build-outs. Anything attributable to FWA, you mentioned that in your remarks, but anything yet apparent in your leasing pipeline that you would attribute to fix wireless access? And then I've got to follow up. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Okay. Yeah. On the BTS, I think you said, if I heard you correctly, you were talking specifically about domestic builds, John?
Jon Atkin: Yes.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I mean, we would like to do more of those certainly. I mean obviously you've seen our numbers over the last few years. They haven't been particularly heroic and a lot of that's because the carriers have tended to go to low-cost providers because that's a choice that they have because there's so much capital out there supporting this particular industry. So we would like to do more. We found a way to do that though is to secure high quality locations to get out ahead of where coverage needs are and secure those opportunities in more of a strategic manner as opposed to pure build astute, although we do some of those still. But yeah, I'd like to be more aggressive on it, for sure. I just don't know if we're going to get to numbers that really move the needle too much. In terms of our backlog and the fixed wireless access influence on it, it's hard for us to say exactly, because fixed wireless access is typically using the 5G oriented mid-band spectrum that is being deployed more broadly. And so I think to date, most of these fixed wireless subscribers have been supported through excess mid-band spectrum that's been deployed, capacity on that spectrum that's been deployed already but it's starting to get closer to a point where that's going to be harder to do because of the amount of consumption for that particular product. So I can't draw a direct line to it yet, but we see signs that the customer's networks are going to become more and more congested as a result of that product, and that ultimately is very good for us.
Jon Atkin: And then AMX seems to have kind of increased as a percentage of your international leasing. Anything around their activity level, or is it a matter of other operators maybe moderating their activity, any color there?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah it's actually Two things. It's one, they have been very active, they've probably been our most active leasing customer broadly across our international markets. But two, with the FX decline in Brazil, they are obviously a tenant there but they have a presence in a number of our other markets, so they're not as affected as some of the other carriers on that list that we share. So their percentage just by default comes up as a result of the FX shift.
Jon Atkin: And then lastly, I've got a question on the balance sheet. Is it -- would it make any sense to utilize your revolver to pay down the ABS debt and then see kind of what happens in terms of Fed cuts later in the year and wait to issue ABS after that?
Brendan Cavanagh: I mean, it could, although you're really making a little bit of a bet because if you're using the ABS market to refinance the existing ABS debt, you are using a benchmark rate that implies a certain expectation around the rate. It's not directly affected by when the Fed cuts, if they cut. So if you were to say, well, I'll hold off and take my chances and do it down the road, the revolver will be priced at a higher rate. So for the time being, you will be paying a much higher rate than you otherwise would. And so does it make sense? Plus we have other financings maturing, one big one in January and then others in January of ‘26. So you can only do that for a limited period of time. So I'm kind of inclined not to think about it that way. But the good news is, we have tremendous liquidity and we can be flexible if necessary.
Jon Atkin: Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. I had two questions. First, with respect to the domestic carrier conversations that you referenced, can you share if those are related to the typical a la carte business that you've seen from your carrier customers, or are these discussions possibly getting you closer to signing additional comprehensive MLAs with additional national wireless carriers? And second, is there any change in timing or magnitude of the anticipated multi-year churn from mergers and industry rationalization for both the domestic and the international segments? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yeah, I mean the conversation -- we're in regular conversations on a daily basis at all different levels with our carrier customers. And so, conversations cover a wide variety of topics and those certainly include the potential for larger, broader deals, but I wouldn't say that that is the sole focus for the time being. We're operating under the existing agreements that we have in place. We do have existing MLAs in place. Some of those involve a la carte type of arrangements, but they define those pretty well. So we continue with business as usual on that front and try to figure out where our customers could use our help the most in terms of their broader, bigger picture initiatives. And if that's best served through an MLA, we're open to that as a possibility. On the timing and the magnitude of the churn from the consolidations, it hasn't really changed too much. I think we tweaked our churn outlook in the US up just slightly, and that had to do basically with the timing of some of the Sprint churn being slightly earlier, but these are really fairly small changes in terms of the overall expectation, for instance, around Sprint. It hasn't changed from what we've given out in the past and I think was reiterated by Marc in his comments earlier today. And internationally, that's generally the case as well. The one thing that could change that is if we were to reach some sort of agreement, specifically with Claro around their Oi wireless overlap in Brazil that pulled forward or changed the timing for some of that, that could obviously have an impact. But as of today, it continues along the same path as we previously laid out.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brandon. I apologize. Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Thanks for joining my questions. First, regarding the pickup in new leasing activity overseas that you cited, can you drill down on that a little bit? Is it coming from a particular market or markets? Does it feel like a blip or the start of something more sustained? Any color there would be great.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, it’s -- I would say that it was across a number of our different markets. I mentioned earlier that Claro was busy. They were a big driver of that. And yeah, I can't say for sure whether it's to be sustained, but our backlogs continue to be pretty strong. And so I hope that in fact it will be. I think there's a lot to do as we look at the needs that these carriers have. It's really more of a financial question, I think, than anything else. So I think it's a good sign to see it ahead of the pace that we expected to be at, at this point. And at this point, I think that that will continue throughout the balance of the year, and we'll let you know where we are as we get into next year.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. And then to follow up on some of the M&A questions, there might be a couple good sized portfolios for sale in the US. I guess, given your current size, 17,500 towers, do you think there are still meaningful strategic or cost efficiency or other benefits to having greater scale in the US? Or do you feel like, given your scale, for all practical purposes there aren't scale driven benefits to be had from a potential deal of those sizes?
Brendan Cavanagh: I think from an operational standpoint that the scale benefits are very limited because we're pretty streamlined at this point. I think there are some certainly but I think it's relatively small part of any large scale deal that we would do here in the US. But there probably are some benefits in terms of just being able to help our customers achieve some of their broader reaching goals if we have a bigger portfolio. That does make a little bit of a difference, I think. But I don't think it's a major factor. I think ultimately they'll need the sites that they need, and we have a lot of great sites and a lot of great locations that are frankly ones that can't be duplicated. So it's something that we would think would be marginally beneficial from a strategic standpoint but marginally being the key word.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks, Brendan.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brandon, you mentioned the US increase in the -- moderate increase in new business execution. Can you comment…
Brendan Cavanagh: Hey, Brandon.
Brandon Nispel: Yep.
Brendan Cavanagh: Brandon, I'm sorry. You were muffled there. I couldn't really hear what you said.
Brandon Nispel: Right, can you guys hear me okay?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, that's better. Thanks.
Brandon Nispel: All right, so you, Brandon, you mentioned increased increase and modest increase in new business execution in the US. Can you say the same for your backlog of lease applications? Is it up or down versus this time last year? Then as we look at the guidance for the rest of the year, it looks like from a new leasing standpoint in the US, it does imply lower in the second half versus the first half. Are you at the point where you can say with confidence that leasing has troughed or is it potential that we see leasing below this $42 million level for next year based on the application pipeline that you have? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I can't give you next year's numbers at this point. I would tell you that from an application standpoint, we have seen increases. Each of the last couple of quarters, quarter-over-quarter, continues to go up, so that's a good sign. But an application doesn't necessarily tell the whole story because you have to see how that plays through and what's the level of equipment that they're installing and so forth. I do think with the increases that we're seeing in terms of interest and applications that we'll see an opportunity to have greater executions as we move through the year, particularly into next year. But there's so much that still has to be -- has to play out for us to know what that does to next year's number that -- it's premature for me to say.
Brandon Nispel: Got it. And could I follow up? On the services guidance cut, last year, and historically T-Mobile's been north of 70% of that business, can you say that the client and services guide was broad, meaning more than one customer, or was it concentrated in one customer? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I would say that it was broad in the sense that it was across the customers that make up that revenue base, although we do have certain concentrations. So obviously it's a greater absolute dollar amount from certain carriers. But there's nothing that stands out about that. It's really more, as I said earlier, it's really more about the mix of work being a little more SDS related instead of construction related.
Brandon Nispel: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. Just two follow-ups. First, I guess to the topic of carrier activity, any changes in activity or uptick in conversations with DISH? And then secondly, on the operational review of the business, I know it was a bigger topic last call and I know it sounds like there's more going on behind the scenes, but is there's any initial findings or when we can anticipate more meaningful updates on that front? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. On DISH, there's been -- we continue to have conversations. They actually do continue to sign leases with us, but there hasn't been any material inflection in that. And we're waiting to see how their plans evolve, if they evolve. I'm sure there are conversations ongoing in terms of the deadlines around their commitments for coverage for next year, and financing, and a number of other things. But we're just here trying to be the best partner we can be to them on their needs. And they continue to sign leases in places where they need it, but it's obviously at a lower level than it was a couple of years ago. So nothing really new there. On the strategic or operational review, yeah, there's only so much I could say at this point because we've done a lot of work, but until we're ready to share with you specific takeaway, specific actions that are being taken, it would be premature for me to talk about that right now. But I do think certainly by the end of the year, I would expect that there will be a number of things that we can share.
Matt Niknam: Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Our Next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thank you for taking my question. It seems on a number of fronts you're in sort of de-risking mode, reducing leverage, considering going at investment grade, exiting some non-core markets. How should we think about your risk tolerance going forward over the next few years relative to what it's been over the past few?
Brendan Cavanagh: I think it will be an informed amount of risk. There's always some degree of risk, particularly when you're making decisions to invest capital and expand by buying or building new assets. So I believe that all of the learnings that we have over the years and what we've seen in each of the markets where we operate make us better informed to understand the risk that we're taking on and to manage and frankly price that in in any decisions that we make. So I don't know that it's changed a lot. I think the knowledge that we have changes every day and that informs it, but our overall risk tolerance is probably not that different, just our education is a little different.
Brendan Lynch: Maybe just to dig in on that a little bit more. Obviously, there's been changes in the cost of capital and the opportunity set. But maybe talk about those dynamics also in the context of just the maturity of the market and how much risk you're willing to take to pursue the next level of growth that might be available.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean, so much of the decisions around investments in the new assets is impacted by your view of the future of those assets in the markets and what are the M&Os in those particular markets going to be doing and what are their needs going forward. And I think almost in every case, when one tower company buys a portfolio instead of another, it probably comes down typically to their view of the future. And one has maybe a slightly more favorable view than another, and therefore they are able to see their way clear to pay a little bit more. And I don't think things are any different than that today. Obviously, the cost of capital being higher makes a difference, but it's higher for everybody. And I think that's what started to normalize. It started to make its way through the system, whereas before you had certain folks who were using capital that was priced at a much lower point, and that was allowing them to continue on buying stuff at prices that were suddenly becoming not as attractive to some of us that were affected more quickly by the change in cost of capital. So I don't think it's any different. I think it's just a matter of everybody adjusting to the cost of capital and then how you see your way clear to obtain the growth necessary on the assets that you're buying.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thank you for the color.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ari Klein: Thank you. Maybe just going back to the carrier inquiries you alluded to, is there any additional context you can provide as to how they've changed and how typical or atypical is it for these conversations to ultimately materialize in better leasing?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, they change in the sense that, at a given point in time in a given market a carrier has more or less initiatives, certain specific needs. They either have them or they don't in a given window of time. But that's not really different than the history of it. It's just as cyclical in different places. So I don't think that the conversations are necessarily that different. I think when they change more meaningfully is when there's a big initiative, a big project, a new spectrum band to roll out or a particular initiative that is carrier specific and that will lead perhaps to maybe a bigger scale agreement, that sort of thing. But the conversations inform our view on where they're going and allow us to better position ourselves in order to capture a greater percentage of the business that's going to come as a result of those initiatives.
Ari Klein: Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Jonathan Chaplin] (ph) with New Street. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. It's Jonathan Chaplin. Two questions, if I may. You mentioned earlier that if you didn't secure attractive assets, that your leverage might continue to tick down. Of course, you could repurchase shares. And I think you also said earlier that you thought the public multiples are too low. Your stock is undervalued. So it's the reason that leverage would tick down. But for asset acquisitions that don't include your own assets, it sort of indicates that you think it's probable that you're going to pick up a decent sized portfolio in the relatively near future. Otherwise, you'd be buying back stock. Or rather, buying back stock and keeping leverage constant.
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, yeah, I didn't say that we are definitely buying a material portfolio. I'd say that we are looking at all kinds of things that are available. And some of those include material portfolios. But whether those happen or not remains to be seen. So sometimes you have to be patient in terms of how you use your capital. We've in the past had people say, well, you must not like your stock because you didn't buy it this quarter. Well, that's not necessarily true. It depends on other things that are going on that take a lot longer than one or two months to determine how they're going to play out. So I think what you should expect is going forward, we will over time have a mix of all of these things. We will do buybacks, we will do debt paydowns, and we will also hopefully buy assets.
Jonathan Chaplin: Got it. And then on a completely different track, which markets do you feel like you're subscaling? And what was sort of different about the thesis when you entered that market versus how it's played out in terms of, did you expect there to be more organic growth in those markets or more portfolios to come up for sale or the portfolios that did come up for sale came at prices that you weren't willing to compete for?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think in the past when we first were entering certain of these markets, our view on scale was that scale is reaching a point that you cover your overhead and you produce positive EBITDA. And I think where our view has evolved is that scale is more than that. It's your relevance to the leading carriers in the market and if you don't have that and in particular international more than this is the case in the US internationally, if you don't have that the way that work is handed out, the way that carriers engage with providers, tower providers in this case, is influenced by the relative importance to their network that you represent. And so we have some places where we simply have small portfolios and there are much bigger players. And so we either need to figure out how to become a bigger player that's more relevant to our customers or we shouldn't be there.
Jonathan Chaplin: All right. Thanks, Brendan. I appreciate that.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Thanks. A couple of follow-ups. First, on the domestic side, normal churn is still running at the high end of 1% to 2% you've laid out. Do you see some opportunity to lower that to the low end? I think some of your peers are suggesting it. And a reminder on the exposure to US seller would be good and how long you have left on that contract? And lastly, SG&A stepped down sequentially, can you talk about if that level is sustainable going forward? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. The opportunity for lower domestic churn, yes. I do think that excluding, of course, Sprint or any other material consolidation that might take place that we would see that number trend down over time. A lot of that was made up of stuff that was smaller companies and that kind of thing. So, I expect to see less and less of that. But we'll see as we get into next year and the years beyond. US Cellular, we have a fairly immaterial exposure. We have less than $20 million a year in revenue from US Cellular and even, obviously a smaller percentage of that overlaps with T-Mobile. So I don't think it'll be overly material, whatever happens there. And on the SG&A front, it did step down quarter over quarter, but typically the first quarter is our highest quarter because of payroll taxes and a number of other specific things. So I think we're at a fairly normal level, but over time it will probably move up with the typical cost of living type of increases that you would expect for overhead of our type.
Batya Levi: Got it. Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Hey, thanks. We don't often get to hear about your track record on deals, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of your recent investments like in Tanzania and the Philippines? How they fare? It would be great just to hear about actual performance in those markets versus your initial underwriting, especially if we kind of consider the capital allocation track record you have as you pursue external growth going forward?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to get too specific on all that, but just to touch on the ones that you mentioned, Tanzania, thus far has worked out extremely well. We've had tremendous growth there that we've been very pleased with from an organic leasing standpoint. Obviously, the entry price we came in was attractive and so the return on investment capital thus far has been tremendous in that market. In the case of the Philippines, it was a little bit of a totally different animal. There wasn't an acquisition there. That was almost all brand new builds. And it's really at a fairly early stage. So I'd say that so far it's gone well. The leasing has been strong, but we have a very small portfolio and they're brand new sites. So we've got to give that a little bit more time to see how it plays out.
David Guarino: Okay. And then, speaking on the topic on acquisitions, you might have mentioned this in the past, but just to clarify, are you more focused on macro tower assets, or given your experience, you guys have made investments in DAS networks and data centers, is that on the table? And then I guess you kind of carry that over to active equipment. We hear about some of that in Europe, and then some fiber assets as well. Just wondering how far you'd want to stretch out that in macro towers?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean, we're a macro tower company, so that’s obviously we've spent the vast majority of our time. The other things were specific items that had ancillary strategic rationale that we were looking at, but it's not the core of what we look at.
David Guarino: Okay, thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you all for joining the call, and we look forward to reporting our results next quarter.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA first quarter results conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 And I now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead. 
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. 
 Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 29, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. 
 In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Marc. 
Marc Montagner: Thank you, Mark. 
 Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currency assumptions, we increased our full year outlook for tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share as compared to our initial 2024 outlook. The primary drivers of these increases are direct cost savings associated with towers to be decommissioned and a reduction in our estimated full year share count from completing share buyback. 
 Due to the current strength of the U.S. dollars versus local currencies in some of our international markets, our overall outlook for site leasing revenue, total revenues, tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA were slightly down versus our initial guidance. 
 First quarter domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 5.9% on a gross basis, 2.3% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. $7.5 million of the first quarter churn was related to Sprint consolidation churn, which we anticipate to be approximately $30 million for the full year 2024. As expected, domestic operational leasing activity of bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was consistent with the levels of activity we saw in 2023. 
 Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn continues to be between 1% and 2% of our domestic site leasing revenue. Our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain unchanged. We anticipate a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2025, $45 million to $55 million in '26 and $10 million to $20 million in 2027. 
 International same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.3% net, including 4.8% of churn or 8.1% on a gross basis. 
 In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.8% on a constant currency basis. As compared to the previous quarter and full year 2023, our reported international growth rate continued to be impacted by a declining local CPI-linked escalator in Brazil. 
 Total international churn remained elevated in the first quarter due mostly to carrier consolidation. During the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue during the quarter. 
 As a reminder, our 2024 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi wireless consolidation other than the amount associated with the previously announced agreement that we executed with Vivo. If, during 2024, we were to enter into further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi wireless consolidation that may have an impact on 2024, we will adjust our outlook in future earnings calls. 
 Additionally, the judicial reorganization plan for Oi wireline was recently approved by a majority of creditors. As a result of this plan, we have increased our full year churn outlook for Oi wireline by $2 million to a total of approximately $4 million. This adjustment is including the updated full year site leasing revenue outlook. As a result, all wireline now represent approximately $20 million total annual site leasing revenue in 2024. 
 During this quarter of 2024, we acquired 11 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $9.2 million. We also built 76 new sites, mostly outside of the U.S. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or under agreement to purchase 271 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $84.5 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the third quarter. 
 Our outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today. We also do not assume any share buyback beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets, share repurchase or both during the year. 
 Our outlook for net cash interest expenses and for FFO and FFO per share continues to include the July 1 refinancing of $620 million ABS Tower Securities scheduled to mature in October '24. We assume a refinancing at a fixed rate of 6% per year. Actual rate and timing may vary from these assumptions. 
 Our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity. If not for the recent share buyback, our $2 billion revolver would have been fully paid down. 
 Our current leverage of 6.5x net debt to EBITDA remains near historical low and well below our steady target of 7 to 7.5x. 
 Our balance sheet is very strong with a current weighted average interest rate of 3.1% across our total outstanding debt. 
 Our weighted average maturity is approximately 4 years, including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate of 96% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.
 And now I turn the call over to Mark. 
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.2 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.5x, below the low end of our target range. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was very strong at 5.2x. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, we have $195 million outstanding under our $2 billion revolver. 
 During the first and second quarter, we repurchased 935,000 shares of our common stock for $200 million at an average price per share of $213.85. We currently have $205 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2024, were 107.9 million. 
 In addition, during the first quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $108.1 million or $0.98 per share. And as of today, we announced that our Board of Directors has declared a second quarter dividend of $0.98 per share, payable on June 19, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close on May 23, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% over the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2023. 
 And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brendan. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. 
 The first quarter marked a good start to 2024. We executed well operationally and produced financial results in line with our expectations. As a result, we have made very few adjustments to our full year outlook on a constant currency basis. 
 In many of our markets, macroeconomic challenges have continued and, as a result, incremental network investments by our customers have remained measured and largely in line with activity levels that we saw last year. 
 In the U.S., leasing activity from an execution standpoint was only slightly higher than the fourth quarter. However, during the first quarter, we saw increases in applications for both new leases and amendments as well as an increase in our services backlog. 
 Our customers continue to have significant network needs. A large percentage of our sites still require 5G-related upgrades. And data-heavy use cases, including fixed wireless access, will compel continued investment by our customers over the next several years. I am personally of the belief that the current high cost of capital environment is perhaps the biggest overhang on this spending and is driving the more elongated spending cycle. 
 Nonetheless, the needs are great. Consumers are demanding and competitive pressures will continue. Our infrastructure will be a critical component of the delivery chain for our customers to meet these challenges, and I believe we are well positioned to support them in their efforts. In addition, the current cost of capital may persist longer than anticipated just a few months ago, but I believe it will ultimately come down in time, which will encourage increased network investment. It is all really just a matter of timing. 
 Internationally, results were also in line with expectations. Although each market has its own specific dynamics, on average, we are in a period of slower growth internationally compared to our historical levels. Lower inflationary escalators are a contributor, but the primary reason is consolidation-related churn and its associated impacts on carrier focus. 
 Internationally, we have found that during these consolidations, the surviving carriers direct most of their attention to rationalizing their existing networks, causing much of their incremental network expansion. However, new spectrum and new technology generation deployments remain important and we believe will result in an acceleration in organic growth rates over time. 
 As discussed on our last call, churn remains elevated due primarily to these consolidations, but we believe that the steps we have taken and are taking to reach mutually beneficial contractual amendments with these customers will enhance the long-term strength and stability of our cash flows. 
 Turning now to our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. We have not shifted our previously stated overall approach, but we do very much make adjustments along the way in response to broader market dynamics and opportunities. We prioritize our dividend and have again announced a quarterly dividend 15% higher than the prior year period. This dividend level remains less than 30% of our guided full year AFFO, leaving meaningful capital available for allocation. 
 During the first quarter, we added a relatively small number of towers to our portfolio and, as a result of carrier consolidation, we decommissioned almost as many sites as we added. We remain selective about the quality of the sites that we add to our portfolio, but we really remain particular about the price at which we add them, which these days has been the main gating issue. That's okay as our focus continues to be on return on investment, not growth just for growth's sake. 
 Opportunities will come along. In fact, they come along all the time. So we are comfortable being patient, appropriately considering the new cost of capital environment we are operating in and going after those opportunities that we believe we can best drive strong returns on. 
 The sites we are decommissioning are related to consolidation activity among our customers. We will be more proactive in the coming years in evaluating naked sites for cost-saving opportunities and potentially decommissioning. 
 As I mentioned earlier, cost of capital, and specifically cost of debt, remains high and is now broadly expected to remain elevated for longer. This dynamic beyond any other has had the most significant impact on public tower company valuations. During the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, we responded to some of this decline in valuations by spending $200 million to repurchase 935,000 shares of our stock. I believe that when there is ultimately a downward shift in rates, repurchases at this level will be even more accretive to future shareholder value. 
 Nonetheless, rates remain elevated today, and we recognize the impact of potential future higher interest costs on AFFO. So a portion of our capital allocation will continue to be appropriately dedicated to reducing debt. 
 We are not formally changing our leverage targets as we believe retaining flexibility for the right investment opportunities is valuable, but operating with lower leverage in the current environment is clearly prudent. 
 Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain in great shape. If not for the share repurchases, our revolver would have been fully paid down as of today. Our average cost of debt remains very low at 3.1%. However, over the next 12 months, we have approximately $1.8 billion that will need to be refinanced. The cost of that debt will certainly be higher than what we are paying today, but our ability to manage the amount of debt needed and the time we are locked into higher rates will be important factors in the approach we take. 
 Capital is widely available to us. It's really just a matter of cost. We are evaluating a variety of options and we'll provide further updates during the year as incremental steps are taken. 
 Finally, I would like to revisit some of my comments from our prior earnings call with regard to the portfolio review we have undertaken. On the last call, I mentioned that we had begun an effort to analyze all of our operations and our potential operations through a lens of stabilizing results, growing our core business and shifting our mix more and more to high-quality assets and operations. I do not see this goal as having a finite deadline as it is more definitional around the key decisions we make. 
 However, there are some very specific steps being taken and looking at each of our key operations, each of our business lines and each of our international markets. We are setting baselines as to where we think these operations end up on a status quo basis 1 year from now, 5 years from now and even 10 years from now. Then based on potential opportunities we see in each case, we are developing alternative results profiles based on different paths we might take, with the ultimate goal being improving the outcome relative to the base case. 
 We are making good progress and gaining good insights through the effort, but this is not an overnight initiative. Many of the potential steps identified to enhance our positioning in given markets or operations will take time, sometimes possibly years, to effectuate. 
 After our prior call, a lot of attention was paid to the possibility of divestitures of businesses or markets. While that may be an outcome in some cases, it is far from our priority or preferred path. I would much rather find ways to improve our position in the market through the addition of quality assets, enhance customer relationships and agreements and other creative solutions. 
 In fact, I was recently visiting our team in Brazil and learned a number of creative solutions we are introducing to enhance the customer experience at our sites and thereby improve the longevity of our customer relationships at those sites. I am encouraged by the seriousness with which our teams are approaching this initiative. 
 In the end though, as I stated previously, financial results always matter, and we will make the best decisions we can to protect or create shareholder value as our top priority. We have a great business and great assets. It is our job as the management team to maximize the value we can realize from those assets, and that is where our focus squarely is. 
 I'd like to wrap up by thanking our team members and our customers for their contributions to our solid first quarter, and we look forward to continuing to share our progress throughout the year. 
 With that, Jeffrey, we are ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Rollins. 
Michael Rollins: Curious if you could discuss a bit more about some of the preconditions you're seeing for better domestic leasing activity, the applications that you described for new leases and amendments, and does this give you encouragement that 2025 can see better leasing activity than 2024. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Mike, I think it's a little bit premature to say that. My comments about the increased applications are obviously positive in general, as increases, obviously, would be. But I think it's a little bit early. It's only been 2 months since our last report. And we haven't seen a material change. We've just seen a minor step-up directionally in those items. So at this point, I think it's too early to comment on where 2025 will come out. 
Michael Rollins: And in terms of just where the activity is coming from, is it coalesced around certain geographies or from certain carriers? 
Brendan Cavanagh: No. I would say it's fairly broad-based. And different geographies, different carriers are perhaps a little bit busier than others. But I think you're aware of some of the initiatives that some of our customers have going on. But I would say, it's generally broad-based across the big 3 carriers. 
Michael Rollins: And just one other question. You mentioned about wanting to manage leverage lower in this environment. Do you have a goal as to where you'd like to see your net debt leverage exit the year? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We don't really have a goal. In fact, we're actually not explicitly changing our targets, although we're obviously operating well below them today. And the reason we're not changing the targets is that opportunities come along and sometimes being flexible and levering back up to take advantage of a particular opportunity may be the best choice, and so I don't want to kind of present it like we have to be the lower number. 
 I think in absence of investment opportunities that we see as particularly value additive, in the current high interest rate environment, the best option in some cases will be to actually pay down absolute debt. So there's not a particular target, but I think outside of some meaningful opportunity for new assets coming along, you should expect that we would look to reduce our absolute debt levels. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin. 
Jonathan Atkin: I was interested in where you see the most interesting build-to-suit opportunities across your markets. And then as we kind of think about M&A, either within existing markets or elsewhere, can you just remind us in terms of what your guidelines are and where you might be seeing opportunities? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. On the new build opportunities, well, first of all, we're looking in every market that we're in for specific opportunities that meet our requirements because we already have a presence in that market and an operation scalability there. So ideally, we'd like to build sites wherever we can. But specifically, certain markets, in our African markets in particular, we're seeing more opportunities and certain select markets in South America as well.
 On the M&A front, I would say the same premise applies in the sense that if we can find high-quality opportunities in any of our existing markets, that's something that we prioritize. But at the end of the day, it really is a financial analysis around the pricing of those assets and what we think we can do in terms of returns based on growth that we think we can achieve over a period typically of about 5 years or so. Our approach hasn't really changed, although our return thresholds have moved up with the cost of capital. 
Jonathan Atkin: And then Brazil, can you remind us broadly where Oi is in terms of the equipment being decommissioned off of towers for their mobile network? And then prospectively, for the wireline, you gave a little bit of color in the prepared remarks, but where are they in terms of physical decommissioning as opposed to you haven't already maybe recognized it in your reporting? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. On the Oi wireless side, it varies by carrier. Obviously, they were absorbed into 3 different carriers. I don't know if I could give you an exact percentage, but they're probably 40-ish percent or so of the way through that effort would be my guess, on average. We're definitely seeing the activity there. But as we see here in the U.S., it's an elongated process and it takes some time. So I'd expect this to go on for a number of years. 
 On the wireline side, we've seen some decommissionings that were really in advance of the efforts that they're undertaking here. But that one actually has the most runway still to go. They just had their reorganization plan approved just a week or so ago. So it's very early days there. But I would expect over the next couple of years, we'll start to get a better sense of that. And in fact, under the plan, they're expecting to reorganize and continue to operate that network at least for the next several years, so we'll see how that progresses in terms of how many sites actually get turned on. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Elias. 
Michael Elias: First, I just want to delve back on the portfolio review. It seems like when you're talking about the M&A environment, valuation is the holdup. I think just interpretation, that's part of the reason why we're seeing you shift more capital allocation to the buyback. Just curious how your thoughts there have evolved, that would be the first thing. And then second, is there any color that you can share in terms of the 271 sites that you announced that you are acquiring, where they're located, that would be helpful. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yes. I would say in terms of evolution of our thinking, we announced this portfolio review publicly last quarter. And it hasn't been that much time, so we're kind of in the midst and throes of that. The one thing that has shifted a little bit, though, in that window of time is that rates are not only staying higher but are expected to continue to stay higher for longer, and that's something that we have to be sensitive to. And so my comments earlier in the prepared remarks are really about that, about the fact that we have to watch that. And in some cases, paying down debt may actually be more accretive than we would have thought even a couple of months ago. And so it's certainly on the table, perhaps more than it was before. And you're right, in that you see less M&A activity and more towards buybacks, for instance, because we see a better return there. So it is still very much financially driven. 
 In terms of the sites that are under contract, it's pretty much the same sites that were under contract, with a very few exceptions, at our last earnings call. There are a mix of markets, some are here in the U.S., but most are located internationally. South America is the primary place where we have those types of contracts. 
Michael Elias: Perfect. And one other question, if I could. On the last quarter earnings call, there was commentary that carrier activity in the U.S. persisted at the current levels that you can see the 4Q '24 exit run rate be below $40 million. Just curious how you're thinking about the potential run rate exiting the year based on the activity that you're currently seeing? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We didn't change any of our outlook for the year, so that still stands as of today that we would expect a similar number to what we talked about last time exiting the year. So right now, we haven't seen enough shift in carrier activity to change those projections. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery. 
Simon Flannery: Brendan, I wonder if you could just characterize some of the big 3 activity. Are you seeing them complete or move further on adding mid-band to existing sites? Are you seeing them move to densification? And any kind of parallels you could draw with the LTE 4G kind of phasing from that initial coverage phase to the next phase, how does this compare? Is it slower, as you noted, because of the rising rates? And perhaps you could just remind us, you talked about an uptick in applications, how should we think about timing from applications to actually execute leases and revenue generation? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean the type of activity, I would say, is a mix. There's still plenty of mid-band spectrum deployments that need to be done, particularly by AT&T and Verizon. And so we're seeing plenty of that. That's the primary driver of amendment activity. But we are seeing more new leases than perhaps we've seen in the past from the big carriers. It's a mix of both coverage and densification, but it's taking a normal transition, I think, that we've seen in previous generations of technology deployment. 
 The difference really, Simon, and you touched on it, you picked up on what I said, which is it's really just timing. We're seeing this kind of go at a much slower pace perhaps than what we've seen before. That can, of course, change rapidly, but I really do believe that just the cost of money has an effect on that. And it makes total sense why our customers would be a little more disciplined in their capital spending. So that's really what we're seeing. 
 And then in terms of the time frame from signing agreements or getting applications in and executing them to ultimately revenue generation, it's pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. It's really just the absolute volume that's a little bit lower. 
Simon Flannery: Great. And any color you can provide on DISH? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean we're still signing some leases with DISH. Obviously, it's at a much lower level than it was when they were busier. And we're here to support them with all their needs, but I don't really have much else I can offer you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rick Prentiss. 
Ric Prentiss: A couple of questions. One, can you unpack for us how much of the stock buyback you did within March and how much you did subsequent to the quarter? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think it's somewhere in our report, or maybe it's not, but it will be in our 10-Q anyway. I believe roughly half, just over half, was in March and the balance was in the beginning of April. 
Ric Prentiss: Sure. Okay. That helps. And then when we think about the leverage, I think the leverage went up to about 6.5 in the quarter. How should we think about stock buybacks versus allocating towards debt reductions as we look out through the rest of this year? Is 6.5 kind of the new normal in this operating environment? Do you want to go down closer to 6? Just trying to think through how buybacks are fitting in with the debt reduction absolute levels? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. It's not so much the leverage ratio. In fact, the ratio was up but the absolute amount of debt was pretty similar to what it was at year-end. It's a little bit higher because of the buybacks, but not much. It was actually higher on a leverage ratio basis because the EBITDA was down a little bit, mainly because of services. So I'm a little less focused there because we have so much room in our ratio and it's more of a focus on the absolute amount of debt that we're carrying, and specifically because we have these maturities that are coming up in the next 8 months or so. And so as I kind of eye that, our ability to kind of reduce the amount of absolute debt as we approach those maturity dates is really what we'll be targeting as opposed to worrying about where the leverage ratio is. 
 And I think on the buyback front, we obviously did a couple of hundred million here, and we would be open to doing more. We've generally been opportunistic about it. But in the short term, we have these maturities and so, to some degree, that takes priority. 
Ric Prentiss: Okay. And then on operational front, I think Marc M. was talking about the Sprint churn, confirming those kind of numbers. Legacy churn, non-carrier consolidation in the U.S. more than 2%. As we look out over the next 1, 2, 3 years, it seems like you might be heading to the lower end of that 1% to 2% historical level because a lot has already been maybe sucked up. Is that something that we might think of as maybe heading more towards the lower end of 1% to 2% as we look out over the next few years? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. That would be my expectation. 
Ric Prentiss: Great. Very helpful. And I appreciate your clarity on the strategic review. That helps. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo. 
Nicholas Del Deo: First, Brendan and Marc, you both commented on tower decommissioning as a source of cost savings and something that might tick up with the consolidation-related churn in the coming periods. Does this entail to anything different than what you have may done historically in churn, like having a lower tolerance for hanging on to naked sites? Or is it just the magnitude of the sites that may be different today versus the past? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I think it's really more the latter. You've got, obviously, on the Sprint/T-Mo related consolidations here. But internationally, with the Oi consolidation in particular, I mean, those are really the big ones. There's some others here and there, but those are the biggest ones. It's a lot of sites. And so as we kind of look at what can we do in this window of time where carrier spending is a little bit slower and we have some of these headwinds, what can we do to maximize our bottom line results. Costs become a little more material potentially to that story of improvement. So it's really more the volume than it is anything else. But that increased volume requires a little bit more of a concerted direct focused effort on it. 
Nicholas Del Deo: Okay. That makes sense. And then Brendan, one more for you. In your prepared remarks, you noted that your team in Brazil is taking steps to enhance I think you said the customer experience at your sites, which should be value accretive over time. Can you expand on that a bit and maybe share an example or two of what those solutions may have been? I mean it just struck me as interesting because at least those of us on the outside don't necessarily think of tower leasing as something where you tend to see a lot of innovation like that, so any description you can share would be interesting. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Well, I'm going to sidestep that a little bit because there are some specific things we're doing that are creative, that actually are adding value for our customers down there. Things that relate to power, that relate to other centralized hosting of wireless coverage solutions and even security-related items. As you add some of these types of things in terms of the service package that you provide, you make your site that much better. And when somebody has the choice to make the choice, you want to have your options be preferred. But it's not just that, it also comes with the ability to enter into longer-term agreements that secure that relationship for an extended period of time. And that's really what we're focusing on. 
 The reason I'm sidestepping it a little bit and not getting too specific with you is that it's a little early and, for competitive reasons, I prefer not to get that specific on it. But as it becomes something that's more material, I'll be happy to share at that point. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Barden. 
Alexander Waters: You got Alex Waters on for Dave. Maybe just first, maybe just when I think about the international churn, obviously elevated this year. I mean, Brendan, could you maybe just walk through the way we should be thinking about it for next year and the couple of years after? And then just in terms of M&A, I think we discussed a little bit about options you might have in existing markets. But can you just talk about your appetite for those that SBA does not have a presence in yet? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure, Alex. Yes, on the international churn front, I would expect that it will be elevated for the next couple of years, maybe not quite as high as it is this year, but it will be elevated by historical standards. We used to have almost 0 churn basically. But we've reached a point where you have a lot more consolidation that's taken place across many of our markets. That's driving a lot of it. And so as we just kind of look at when leases are scheduled to roll off and where there's been consolidations and what we think our exposures we might have, plus, frankly, the Oi wireline bankruptcy, those things will, I believe, cause it to stay elevated for the next several years, although, again, hopefully not quite as high as it's been this year.
 On the M&A front, yes, I mean, new markets are certainly on the table for us. We're very financially focused when evaluating the opportunities. I believe that our experience over the last decade or more of expanding into international markets has given us the comfort and the confidence that we can do that as well as anybody that we know the things that we need to understand before we enter a market, how to set up operations in a new market. So I'm confident that we can do it from an operational standpoint. 
 It really just comes down to opportunity that's on the table and the price point at which we can secure it so that it is value additive ultimately for the company as a whole and for our shareholders. That's the guiding issue. And that's harder and harder these days broadly, whether it's new markets or existing markets, because there are a number of situations where I don't think seller expectations have aligned still with where the market has gone. But that could change over time and our willingness to expand in our existing markets or in new markets would remain the same. We would be open to it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Batya Levi. 
Batya Levi: A couple of follow-ups. On the network services side, can you talk a little bit about the slowdown you saw in the quarter? And I think you're tracking below your annual guidance. Should we expect this quarter to be the trough and continue to improve from here? And maybe on the tower side, can you give an update on what percent of your sites have been upgraded with 5G equipment now? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. On the services business, yes, it's down a little bit. But as you saw, we did not change our full year outlook, and we do expect that the second half of the year will be slightly higher than the first half of the year. I mentioned in my comments that we saw an increase in our services backlog from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter. That is supportive of that. And all those little things around applications being up, services backlog being higher, support that I think we will see a little bit more services activity in the second half of the year. But I think we'll be able to give you more clarity on that on the next call.
 On the tower side, 5G percentage, we're a little more than half now. I think we've said we were around half in the past. While we've seen some increase obviously through the first quarter with volumes being a little bit lower, it's only a little more than half. So the actual percentage that's left to be upgraded is still significant. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Choe. 
Richard Choe: I have two follow-ups also. I'm not sure if you can tell, but the new lease densification applications, are they mainly in markets where there's a significant amount of fixed wireless? 
Brendan Cavanagh: I can't tell you that for sure, Richard. But that would not be an unreasonable assumption, but I can't tell you that for sure. 
Richard Choe: Got it. And then on the decommissionings and cost savings, is there a significant delay from when the decommissions happen and when you can do the cost savings given maybe the ground leases underlying? Or can you kind of get ahead of it and kind of close that timing gap? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, our goal is to achieve those savings as quickly as we can. And you're right that there will be many cases where we're able to do that ahead of the decommissioning. In fact, in some cases, it would be our desire to not do the decommissioning and simply put those costs on hold to allow enough time to see what happens. So I think it will be a mix. But where we're able to do that, obviously, it accelerates our ability to generate the cost savings. So that's our first priority. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Niknam. 
Matthew Niknam: Just two, if I could. First, on the debt maturities, I think you talked about evaluating a variety of options in relation to that. Is there any more color you can share in terms of what's being evaluated in terms of alternative sources of capital? And is there the potential for cap recycling with where multiples and valuations are in the private markets? And then just secondarily, on the tower decommissioning, it's more of a housekeeping item, is that what's driving the boost to tower cash flow ex FX relative to the slight reduction in site leasing tied to the Oi churn? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Your second question, the answer is yes. That is the primary driver. I mean it's small dollars, obviously. You're talking about $4 million for the year, but yes, that's the driver. 
 On the first question, when I talk about different options, we're mostly referring to different markets, types of debt that we might issue to refinance it. On the question about the cap recycling type of solution, at this point, I think I would defer on that. But the bottom line is we're open to looking at all the different options that are available to us, trying to find the most creative and cost-effective solutions that we can. And we'll let you know as we secure something. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow. 
Eric Luebchow: Brendan, maybe you could talk a little bit about the comprehensive MLA you signed with AT&T last year. Any kind of early learnings on whether you think that's helped generate more activity on your site with that customer and whether there may be appetite for similar agreements with some of your other customers? I believe that T-Mobile had an agreement that expired relatively recently. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, it's actually been very good in the sense that I think it's kind of loosen the gears up, if you will, between the 2 companies. They have a lot of work to do, and we're a big supplier of theirs in terms of tower space. So the ability to have a much easier, free flowing kind of understood process by which we they make requests and we help satisfy those requests has been a positive. And so I think that, in and of itself, is something that we love to have with all of our customers. And I think we generally do. But with AT&T perhaps, it was the one that given that we have never really had any kind of master agreement with them, there was a little more low-hanging fruit there to address. 
 In terms of the others, every agreement, I think, is very specific to the relationship with that customer and what their needs are and their existing relationship with us. So we're certainly open to master agreements. We've had them in the past with the others. In the case of the T-Mobile agreement, you mentioned that it expired, that's true, but we actually did extend it for a period of time while we kind of look at the longer-term needs for them and how we might structure something that's favorable for both companies into the future. So I think that evidences the fact that we work together well with our customers and are able to find solutions that are beneficial for both parties. 
Eric Luebchow: Great. And just one follow-up from one of the earlier questions. I think you talked about getting to 1% U.S. tower churn, excluding Sprint, in the next few years. So just a glide path to get there, is that coming more from some of your smaller customers? Are you also seeing some current opportunities with the big 3 or 4 customers? Does it have anything to do with less competitive activity from tower overbuilders or anything you can cite to kind of get down to those levels? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I think it's both. You have less smaller guys just in general. And so therefore, there's just less of a pool of potential leases to churn with the kind of more narrowband type of tenants that we have, so that is a contributor. And with the bigger guys, I think as you have these master agreements, you have less of these, as you said, over builders that are out there and others that are trying to find ways to take existing tenants. While not particularly successful in the past, there were some amount of that. I think that's sort of gone its way and you'll see less and less of that happening in general. So I believe all of those factors will play into it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Walter Piecyk. 
Walter Piecyk: I just wanted to go back to the math on the debt reduction and the share repurchase because I think, basically, the way you described it is you noticed what was going on, longer and higher, but then you continued to buy stock back into April, which, I guess, if you could comment on that because I'm not sure how those two things fit. 
 But then if you look at kind of the reduction on an empirical basis, in '23, we reduced it $600 million. Obviously, you're not on the pace of that yet this year for any reduction, but again, piecemealing, I know 3 or 4 people asked this question, you kind of referenced the $800 million of debt maturities. So if we look at you using another $100 million already in the June quarter and then just the free cash flow in advance of those maturities, it would seem to me that you basically have to turn that spigot off for any share repurchase for the remainder of the quarter and into Q3 if you're specifically targeting those maturities. 
 I get it that you're looking for other ways to, I guess, refi it or whatever. So if you could just comment on why you were buying stock back when things change. Should we expect more than $600 million given the comments that you made? And how can you do share repurchase if you've got these maturities that you want to address? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I'm not sure if there's just a moment in time when things change. We bought back stock in late March and basically the first few days of April. And I think that, that still is a good return on investment. The reality, Walt, is it's hard to be that precise and exact-timing all of these things. And I think as we go forward, it doesn't mean that we won't buy stock back at all. I'm just telling you that directionally, as I look at it today, that I think paydowns of debt is slightly more accretive than buying back stock where it is right now. But that doesn't mean there won't be opportunities to do both, and I expect we will do both going forward. But we're going to see what other options we have available to us as we move through the balance of the year, and that will influence how it plays out. 
Mark DeRussy: Well, I will add one thing here and that is to say buybacks have a certain mechanic to them where when we were in a blackout period, we typically put a plan in place. And those plans typically prevent us from actually making decisions. So the decisions are made ahead of time, and I think that may help explain the timing of this relative to your comments. 
Walter Piecyk: That's fine, Mark. I appreciate that. Just one follow-up though. Again, just based on math, right, this is a very predictable business, right? We can see what the free cash flow is. If you think share repurchase is more important for these reasons that you've outlined, which I don't disagree with, right, and assuming that, that view doesn't change, all of a sudden, the Fed doesn't start f***ing dropping rates left and right in the near future, again, unlikely, I just don't see how that doesn't mean that you have to mostly turn off the share repurchase spigot at least through the end of the year, like it's just the math of the free cash flow and what's available in terms of at least trying to top the $600 million reduction that you did last year. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. No, that's true. There is a certain amount of cash that's available under the current structure that we've got. We're producing a certain amount of AFFO and the proportion allocated to the dividend, and there's the rest, right? And the rest will go to one of these buckets or a mix of these buckets. So what you're saying is right. But things may adjust. Frankly, we may end up with an acquisition opportunity that we think is actually better than all, and that would put both of these things to the side. So I'm retaining some flexibility. But yes, if we're going to pay down a meaningful amount of debt, obviously, we have to stop spending on everything else. 
Walter Piecyk: Just got one last operational question. I guess I'll phrase it this way, outside of the big 3 operators and DISH, have you seen anyone demonstrating interest in or submitting applications for CBRS spectrum to deploy on your towers? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Nothing material. No, nothing really. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brandon Nispel. 
Brandon Nispel: A quick one for Mark. Could you just quantify the impact of customer consolidation churn versus normal course churn in the quarter, both domestically and international? And maybe for Brendan, sitting here, looking at your leasing and churn numbers... 
Brendan Cavanagh: Brandon, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we're having a little bit of a hard time hearing you, you're a little garbled. You may have to repeat that first. 
Brandon Nispel: Can you hear me better now? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, that's much better. Thanks. 
Brandon Nispel: Okay. I'll just start over. So a quick question for Mark, could you just quantify the impact of customer consolidation-driven churn domestically in internationally versus normal course churn in the quarter? 
 And then, Brendan, for you with where you're sitting today from a leasing standpoint and churn standpoint, internationally and domestically, and what you know about your maturities coming up, what do you think is a reasonable level of AFFO per share growth looking out to '25 and '26 when your heaviest maturities are coming due? 
Brendan Cavanagh: On the second question, AFFO per share growth. I think, Brandon, I mean, the real trick in answering that is that interest rates and interest expense play such a big role in it. So if it weren't for that, if I could tell you exactly what it was going to cost to refinance debt and what the timing was going to be, I could answer that question with a little more precision. Obviously, we make certain assumptions internally here, but I'd rather not speculate on that. If you kind of took that away, I think, a mid-single-digit percentage growth rate for AFFO per share would be what we would achieve even with the churn, but the interest headwinds are going to be a challenge to that.
 And then the first question was the customer consolidation churn percentage, Marc? 
Marc Montagner: Yes. So domestically, Sprint was more than half of the tower churn in the U.S. Internationally, I would say that the majority was in Oi for this first quarter, but Oi is going to pick up in Brazil. So I think we said overall the Oi churn in Brazil would be about $15 million for the year. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Brendan Lynch. 
Brendan Lynch: Yes, Brendan Lynch. Maybe just on the refinancings coming up this year, to what extent are you comfortable using the revolver to refinance that debt, if not longer term, at least in the in the short term? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean that's one option that's obviously on the table. The advantage to it, of course, is that it would allow you to retire it quickly over time or as you could over time without having to lock into a longer-term maturity date. But the negative is that it's some of the most expensive debt that we have right now. It would be more expensive than obviously whenever we would refinance it with in a different market. So it's an option. 
Brendan Lynch: Okay. And maybe just one on the technology front. A few quarters back, you were discussing dual-band radios as a potential driver of incremental demand. Maybe just give us an update on where that stands and any other technology initiatives that your customers might be looking at that could contribute to incremental demand going forward? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Well, we saw a decent amount of deployment of dual-band radios. That certainly was a driver last year and maybe even before that. But at this stage, it seems like most of the focus is on just deploying the mid-band spectrum that they have on hand and just incremental new leases, as we talked about before, for coverage and densification. I wouldn't say that there's anything more technical than that. 
Operator: There's currently no other questions in the queue at this time. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Great. Thank you all for dialing in. We appreciate your time tonight and look forward to reporting to you next quarter. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today. Thanks for your participation and using the AT&T Event Conferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good morning, everyone -- I'm sorry -- good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 26, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Marc to discuss our fourth quarter results and 2024 outlook.
Marc Montagner: Thank you, Mark. We ended 2023 with another strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allow us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Consolidated same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.6% net year-over-year including impact of 3.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 7.5%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.9% on a gross basis and 3.5% on a net basis, including 3.4% of churn. Of that 3.4%, 1.6% was related to Sprint consolidation churn. As expected, domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was consistent with the lower levels of activity we saw during the second and third quarter of 2023. Full year organic leasing contribution to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our previously provided outlook. Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn was also in line with our prior expectations and continues to be between 1% and 2% of our domestic site leasing revenue. International same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.2% net, including 5.9% of churn or 10.1% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 8% on a constant currency basis. Total international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due mostly to [carrier] (ph) consolidation. During the fourth quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in US dollars. The majority of non-US dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we expanded our tower portfolio, acquiring 23 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $21.3 million. We also built 138 new sites. Subsequent to the quarter end, we have purchased under agreement to acquire 281 sites in all of our existing markets for an aggregate price of $87.8 million. We anticipate closing on this site under contract by the end of the third quarter. Looking ahead, this afternoon, earnings press release includes our initial outlook for the full year 2024. Our outlook reflects a continuation of the reduced level of carrier CapEx that began early last year. Despite this, our leasing business will continue to grow organically through contribution from new leases amendment and contracted escalators. Domestically, our outlook assumes $55 million of customer churn in 2024, of which approximately $30 million related to Sprint related decommissioning. Our previously provided estimate of aggregate Sprint related churn over the next several years remain largely unchanged. We anticipate a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2025, $45 million to $55 million in 2026 and $10 million to $20 million in 2027. Internationally, our outlook includes approximately $22 million churn in 2024. During the fourth quarter of '23, we signed a multiyear agreement with Vivo in Brazil. Under this agreement, we expect to incur $4 million wireless consolidation churn in 2024 and an additional $2 million over the next several years. Total anticipated wireless consolidated churn remains at approximately $30 million. Additionally, our full year 2024 outlook reflects a year-over-year decline in service revenue and gross profit due to the lower overall carrier activity in the US. However, our outlook is in line with the historical performance, excluding our very strong result in 2022 and '23 due to the initial rollout of 5G network by some of our wireless customers during these years. This outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract and does not assume any share repurchase. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets and/or share repurchase during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and core FFO and FFO per share include the recent refinancing of our term loan B debt, the upsize of our credit facility and the future [refinancing up with rerating rate] (ph) in the future of our $620 million ABS tower securities maturing in October 2024. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we have ample liquidity. In January of 2024, we refinanced our $2.3 billion credit facility, pushing out the maturity to 2031. We also increased our revolver capacity by $500 million. Our $2 billion revolver is almost fully paid down. Our leverage remains at historical lows and well below our steady target of 7 to 7.5 turns, giving us plenty of dry powder for opportunistic acquisition and/or share repurchase. Lastly, we purchased a forward-starting interest rate swap in the fourth quarter. This will give us great certainty around great uncertainty on future interest costs. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark, who will provide additional detail.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.1 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.3 times, which is below the low end of our target range and near the lowest level we have seen in decades. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was very strong at 5.2 times. During the fourth quarter 2023, the company entered into a $1 billion forward starting interest rate swap, which will swap one-month SOFR for a fixed rate of 3.83%. The swap has an effective start date of March 31, 2025, which coincides with the expiration of our existing $1.95 billion notional interest rate swap. This forward starting interest rate swap agreement will expire April 11, 2028. Subsequent to the fourth quarter and on January 25th of 2024, the company issued a new $2.3 billion secured term loan B under its amended and restated senior credit agreement. This matures in January of 2031. The new term loan accrues interest at SOFR plus 200 basis points. The existing $1.95 billion interest rate swap will remain in effect until expiration on March 31, 2025. The term loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. The proceeds were used to retire the company's 2018 term loan and to pay related fees and expenses. Also subsequent to the quarter, on February 23, 2024, the company further increased the total commitments under the revolving credit facility from $1.75 billion to $2 billion. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts under the revolver. And as of today, we have a $70 million outstanding balance under our $2 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.1 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.4%. The interest rate on 97% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the fourth quarter, as we previously discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we repurchased 235 -- I'm sorry, 234,000 shares of our common stock, $46 million at an average price of $198.27 per share. We currently have $405 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at December 31, 2023, were 108.1 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $91.8 million or $0.85 a share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.98 per share payable on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 14, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% over the dividend we paid in the fourth quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. I am pleased for the opportunity to reflect on our 2023 performance and to share our thoughts about 2024 and beyond. 2023 was a year marked by some significant macro headwinds, in particular, the consistently high interest rate environment that not only directly affected SBA's floating rate debt costs and the views around our cost of future refinancing, but also impacted our customers and their network spending levels. In spite of these macro headwinds, SBA executed extremely well and produced solid financial results. When compared against the initial outlook for 2023, given in February of last year, our actual results for the year finished materially above the high end of the ranges given for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Most of the outperformance was organic as we spent very little incremental discretionary CapEx in comparison to our initial outlook. Our excess free cash flow was instead largely spent on paying down our floating rate revolver debt, and we finished the year at a multi-decade low leverage level of 6.3 times and today have a current revolver balance of only $70 million. Internally, it was a year of leadership transition for the company. Jeff Stoops retirement, the addition of Marc Montagner to the team and new leaders in our international, legal and IT functions. Everyone has stepped up extremely well into their roles, and I am very happy with how the team is collaborating and performing. The disciplined succession planning and highly capable team members assembled throughout the organization have positioned us well for the future. As we look forward to 2024, we recognize that we are coming off of a period of reduced network investment by our largest domestic customers. However, future network needs for each of these customers remain significant, and we anticipate being a critical partner for our customers in meeting their operational goals and objectives. A significant percentage of our sites still require 5G-related upgrades, which we are confident will take place over the next couple of years. In addition, the success and growth of fixed wireless access as a product offering for our customers will add greater demand for increased network capacity as the average user of this product uses 20 times or more broadband data than the typical mobile customer. And the evolution of AI-infused 5G offerings will continue to fuel the demand for improved speeds and lower latency. All of these factors as well as good old-fashioned service-based competition are supportive of steady organic leasing activity on our US assets for years to come. Internationally, we also see a dynamic of significant network needs, providing a backdrop for continued solid organic leasing activity throughout many of our markets. Financial pressures have impacted many of our international customers as well but the demand for advanced wireless products and services is significant, and in a number of cases, even greater than that seen in the US. We expect this will in turn drive continued demand for incremental space at our tower sites. Nonetheless, there have been customer consolidations in several of our markets. As a result, we have worked closely with our customers to help them achieve necessary efficiencies in their operations, but while preserving the breadth of our business relationships, and solidifying our contractual commitments for the long term. While this temporarily leads to elevated churn, we believe the long-term strength and stability of our cash flow streams produced as a result of these efforts meaningfully improves our go-forward value proposition. This is a good segue into my views around our forward strategy. Internally, we are highlighting a desire to analyze everything we do or consider doing through the lens of stabilizing our results, growing our core business and shifting our mix more and more to high-quality assets and operations. While this is not materially different than the approach SBA has taken throughout its history, we recognize that not all of our assets or business lines fit well within this goal. As a result, we are doing the work to evaluate our full portfolio and develop action plans around how we improve our position in each business line and in each market. For instance, in our international operations, we have found it to be valuable to be a market leader in the markets we operate in. In places where we hold a more significant position, we have tended to do better than those places where we do not. This ultimately means that we need to find a path to increase scale in certain markets or possibly exit a market. An example of this was our fourth quarter exit from Argentina. Not only was our market position subscale, but the economic instability in that country created operational challenges that were dilutive to the otherwise typically very attractive attributes of the tower business. We will pursue incremental investments to drive continued growth as we always have. But we will prioritize either an overall favorable shift in the quality and stability of our asset mix or an opportunistic investment that improves our standing and existing markets. Financial results always matter. We will be disciplined toward producing the best possible financial results over the long term. We believe high-quality assets ultimately produce that result. We also believe that when opportunities for incremental asset investments are not available, stock repurchases and debt reductions are worthwhile uses of capital. We intend to continually evaluate our optimal capital structure, and we'll look to balance the lowest cost of capital with retaining appropriate investment flexibility. Our attention to optimize capitalization of the company has placed us in what I believe is the best position in the industry. We are the fastest dividend grower, but yet have the greatest retained AFFO post dividend to invest in the business. We have maintained an average cost of debt very close to our larger peers, but have retained access to up to two turns more leverage. We have recently extended and expanded our revolver capacity by $500 million, creating increased liquidity. This structure provides us with significant optionality to move in whichever direction we believe will provide the best return for our shareholders. The strength and stability of our core tower business remains and it provides a tremendous foundation for all future endeavors. As a result, I have great confidence in our ability to create future value for our shareholders. I want to thank our customers for their support and their confidence in SBA. I also want to thank our team members for their contributions to our success. And with that, Eric, we are ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First, we will hear from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone and Brendan, congrats on the new seat. Mark with the K, welcome to the calls.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you.
Ric Prentiss: First, leverage obviously has been a key focus. You guys have been paying down floating rate debt. You've got your net leverage down to 6.3 turns. Almost all the floating is paid off as of today then. How should we think about 6.3, where it heads in the future versus stock buyback? And then on the M&A side, update us as far as what you're seeing out there, you mentioned that you like to be the leader in your markets. Are there any deals out there that would give you an industry-leading position? And what would kind of make that an interesting market if there were new markets out there?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So Rick, on the leverage side, we're at 6.3 times mostly because we believe that throughout the last year, the best use of our capital was into paying down that floating rate debt that we had with some of the highest cost debt in our structure. And we didn't necessarily see opportunities that we thought were a better use of capital. but we're comfortable at a higher level of leverage if we see the right place to use that capital. That may include some amount of stock buybacks, but it also obviously would include quality acquisitions if we see that opportunity. So really, what we're doing is, we're retaining flexibility as it relates to our balance sheet to go in whichever direction we think produces the best result. We don't feel that we have to stay at this level, but if we do, that's fine too. On the M&A front, yeah, it's one of the aspects of what we look for when we're looking at a new market or even at opportunities within some of our existing markets where we're perhaps not a market leader in terms of our position is to be a leader, if we can in terms of our size and importance to our customers. We used to just assume that we look at all opportunities that are available throughout the globe, frankly, as they come available, and we consider that among a number of other factors where we're looking at that. I can't really speak to anything specific that we're looking at, but there definitely are opportunities out there.
Ric Prentiss: Obviously, we're sitting here at the end of February. Can you help us understand the pacing of what you think new lease activity in the United States will kind of play out through the year? And is it still kind of three months, maybe closer to six months as far as when you get an application in to where it actually turns into revenue?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. The time frame from signing something to when it actually gets into revenue is still pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. Obviously, it's a little bit longer for a brand-new lease when we sign that. That's usually a good six months or more on the amendments, it's typically shorter, closer to three months, but it depends on the specific circumstances. So that's pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. In terms of the pacing throughout the year, our projections, if you look at our bridge in terms of what we've put forth as contributions, and I assume you're asking about domestic specifically. But domestically, that number should be a little bit more front-end loaded today because it's based on activity that we've seen throughout last year and that's kind of rolling over. And at this point, we're not necessarily forecasting a material pickup in activity. But to the extent there is that pickup in activity, it's mostly going to impact next year.
Ric Prentiss: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And next we will hear from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. Two questions. One, you talked about the willingness to examine an exit from markets where you lack scale, does that apply to product areas such as data centers? And then my second question is, you called out the Vivo relationship in Brazil. Anything with TIM or Claro along similar lines where you might be renegotiating some of your commercial terms or looking to kind of react to market conditions in Brazil? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. On your first question, there's no specific plans to exit anything -- to exit the data centers or anything else in particular. But I will tell you that we are applying the same lens to everything that we do as we kind of evaluate these various things, whether it's international markets or its other product lines. And we look at that through a financial lens and what the future can be, opportunities to grow it, what are the synergies with our base core business. I mean, ultimately, we're a tower company, how do things fit in with that. As we go through that analysis, we may come to the conclusion with something that we should exit it, but we may also come to the conclusion that we should grow it too. So at this stage, it's premature to say that we would make a decision one way or the other, but you should assume that we're looking at each of our holdings through that lens. With regard to Brazil, we did actually -- I don't know if you recall, Jon, but last year, we announced about a year ago at this time that we had entered into an agreement with TIM related to the Oi consolidation and it actually pulled forward some of the churn into 2023 associated with that consolidation, but it dealt with a number of other issues and extended agreements out. So we already have something largely in place with Tim. In the case of Claro, there's currently nothing in place, but we're constantly in discussions with them and it may or may not lead to something, but we're talking with them about what would be best for them and for us.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we’ll hear form Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for taking my question and congratulations both Brendan and Mark on your newish positions. Brendan, I guess to start, you noted that you tend to do better in markets where you have meaningful scale or a leadership position. How do you define a leadership position? Is that share of total assets owned both on threshold? Or is it some other measure? And does this general framework that you're embracing mean it's less likely that you're going to enter into a new market? Or is that sort of a separate consideration if you think you're on a path to a leadership position in it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. It basically means your relevance in the market to your customers, which generally means the size and scale of your operations. So the percentage of the portfolio that you represent for the larger, most important customers in that market. When you are at a level that is frankly immaterial to their network needs, your ability to drive additional business and to negotiate terms on new opportunities is just not as great as when you're a more meaningful partner. So that's really what I mean when I talk about the size and scale. As it relates to new markets, that would be a consideration, obviously, before we go into the new market, what's our position going to look like in that market. So it doesn't mean that we would not go into a new market, but we would consider that factor as one of the factors when we're thinking about it.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. And then regarding domestic leasing in '24 in the US, your guidance of $42 million this year, and you just said it was going to be probably front-end loaded. I think you've previously spoken to sort of the low end of a range of leasing over time as being around $40 million. It seems like the run rate in the second half of the year, if $42 million is front-end loaded, it might annualize to a pace below $40 million. I guess do you see a plausible scenario where full year leasing could go below $40 million in light of current conditions?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, yeah, it could. Obviously, we're just above $40 million now for this year. So if we don't see any pickup as we get to the second half of the year, I do expect that the run rate at the end of the year today, that's implied in our guidance would be slightly below $40 million. So it’s possible. I think though some of this is lumpiness in the way that things come in under our AT&T MLA agreement. So the fact that it's a little higher in the first part of the year and a little lower in the second half of the year could be something we see next year as well.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Thanks for that, Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Thanks so much for taking the questions. So I guess the first one, for the guidance, it was clear that you weren't assuming any new portfolio acquisitions or buybacks, but could you be specific about what you are assuming in the guide for the use of cash? Is it putting it in the bank at a 5% interest rate? Or what should we kind of use as a baseline as a comparison to what's going on? I guess a second question, if I could, is -- Brendan, is there a fuse on any of these decisions about whether to pull the trigger on portfolio acquisition versus stock buybacks, given that your stock buybacks could be pretty powerful if they happen sooner rather than later? And I apologize, if I could just one last one for Mark D. This $1 billion hedge on a forward basis that you've put in place, which replaces the existing hedge on the $2 billion term that comes due March '25, I'm assuming that there's an opportunity if you chose to do something additional to the $3.85 million that you've locked in, is there a timetable to make that decision? Thank you.
Mark DeRussy: There is the possibility to do that. We have done this in the past. This hedge only represents 50% of what our actual outstanding debt is. So there could be room to increase our or hedging along those lines as well. But with respect to any type of timetable, David, no, there is no timetable. We're just going to keep an eye on the market and act appropriately if we decide that that's the thing that we need to do.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. On that item, David, I mean, really the thinking was that we sort of took half of it and created some level of certainty given that there's some instability, obviously, in what interest rates will look like. And we've seen -- we've all seen over the last few months, expectations of when interest rate cuts are going to happen, move around quite a bit. So for us, we basically ensure that a portion of that debt, we would have some stability and certainty on it. And it locks in basically at much lower rate than exists today. So if we let the other piece flow, I think we can have a good natural hedge in that case. On your other questions on the use of cash in our guidance, we do -- because there will be cash that's obviously accumulated, part of it first goes into paying down the revolver, of course, what's left outstanding on that and it covers some of the discretionary spending that is implied in our guidance for deals that are under contract as well as new builds, the items that are basically covered in our discretionary CapEx guidance. Anything excess is assumed to be invested at about a 4% or so interest rate. So that is implied in our net cash interest guidance, some interest income on that. And then I think your other question was the M&A versus buybacks and the timing. I mean, we -- there's a variety of things that we're constantly looking at. And the timing of M&A transactions, you don't have as much control over. Obviously, we have complete control over buybacks. And so -- to some degree, we have to balance the capital that we have available and that we may or may not need. And so sometimes we can jump in earlier. If we have a clear vision as to what's going to happen and other times, we have to hold back a little bit and see how things play out. So I hear what you're saying, and we obviously believe our stock is a good buy at this level that we've got to balance that against all the different options in front of us.
David Barden: Got it, very helpful. Thank you guys.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I could. First, as you look at the business going forward, can you give us an update as to what are your North Star metrics that are guiding the decision-making and your measurement of performance? Is it organic leasing, EBITDA, AFFO per share or other metrics that are important to you and the Board? And can you give us some direction of how you see that growth in those metrics, let's say, over the next three years? And then just separately, just more of an operational question on the tower portfolio. Can you give us an update as to what percent of the sites have been upgraded and touched to bring them to 5G mid-band capabilities? And over what period do you think you get to 100%? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So, Mike, the numbers that we typically report on, we report on because we think they're the most important. I think the number one metric in our view here and with our Board and frankly, with many of our investors is AFFO per share because it represents that amount of actual free cash flow that is available to be returned to shareholders in some form or fashion, whether that be reinvested into the business, or be paid out as a dividend or be used for stock buybacks, whatever the usage is, it's effectively what's available at the end of the day after everything has been paid for. And so that's the metric that we focus on most of all. Having said that, obviously, the next few years, there are some challenges to our AFFO per share metric, largely because of two things that are not new. Interest rates, we've done an excellent job over the last many years locking in very low-cost debt, but the market is what it is. And at some point, you have to refinance at least some of that debt. And so you're going to see higher interest costs that weighs on that a little bit. And of course, the Sprint churn, in particular, that is kind of out there that we know we have ahead of us, and we've scoped for you as to what that looks like. But outside of that, the real goal, frankly, is to see that number go up over an extended period of time. This is a business that is a very long-term business at its core. We have very long-term contracts. Our relationships are long term. The assets are long term. And so we look at how we're going to maximize that number over an extended period of time. As a public company, it can be challenging because you're reporting every single quarter, and so it gets scrutinized every quarter, but the nature of the business is long term. So we try to take that long-term view on how we're going to grow that number out over a period of five to 10 years. And I think we'll be well positioned to do that. The other metrics though are very important as well. Obviously, growing site leasing revenue, growing adjusted EBITDA shows that we're able to find continued returns on our operations, but really AFFO per share is where I focus most of my energy. And then I guess your second question was about the upgrade percentage for 5G. We're a little bit over halfway in terms of upgrades to our sites for 5G, but that is different among the different carriers. Some are much further along and others are below that number. So we still have a pretty good runway. I think we're looking at the next two to three years to get to where they've upgraded all the sites they need to.
Michael Rollins: Thanks. That’s very helpful.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: And next, we will hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Right. Thank you very much and congrats on your new role, Brendan and Mark, great to reconnect and good luck in your new role. Two, if I could. First, on the M&A. I think in the past, you've noted that the M&A multiples haven't necessarily come in to reflect the new interest rate environment. It would be great to just get some perspective of -- if you see a better risk-reward balance there for the growth and the multiples that you're paying. Obviously, you've done some transactions versus buying back your own stock? And secondly, anything you could share with us on DISH and how you think about DISH within your leasing assumptions, especially given they have some specific FCC and DOJ targets to hit in mid-'25? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, the M&A market is still quite competitive. In the US, in particular, because there's such a limited number of assets available, they're very competitively bid. So we continue to see price points that are very high. Internationally, that is also true, although I would say we've seen a little more moderation with the increasing cost of capital in terms of international price points. But the interesting thing about that is what it's resulted in is not necessarily deals being done at lower prices in many cases, but frankly, deals not getting done at all where there's sort of a disconnect between where seller expectations are and where buyers are willing to pay. I think you'll start to see some of that shift over the course of the coming year, particularly if the interest rate environment remains elevated. In the case of DISH, yeah, they are certainly a component of our assumptions for our leasing growth for this year. They have -- they do have the deadlines that you mentioned, and we've had ongoing conversations with them, and we believe that they will be attacking those obligations aggressively. So we do have some amount of growth in our model associated with DISH. But I would say it's a relatively small percentage of the total.
Simon Flannery: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: And next, we will hear from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Just a two-parter. First, on the strategic review, Brendan, is this at all a pullback from I guess, more emerging markets and a pivot of the portfolio towards more developed markets? Is there anything of that sort underpinning the review? And then maybe on a related note, any additional color you could provide on the 281 sites that were acquired subsequent to 4Q just in terms of region or any other color you can share? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. I'll take the second one first. The 281 aren't necessarily all closed at this point. They're either -- I think a few are closed, but most are just under contract at this point. And about 10% of those are in the US. The remaining 90% are located throughout our existing markets in half a dozen different countries that we're already in. In the case of the way we're thinking about the strategic review, it's really -- it's not necessarily emerging markets versus developed although that can be a factor. It's a focus on how we maximize our position in those markets. So we have positions in emerging markets that are very strong because of the strength of our role and our existing relationships with the strongest carriers in those markets. And so if we can enhance that in places where we don't have it, then I think we would be comfortable with the markets regardless of whether they were necessarily developed or emerging markets. However, I think developed markets do offer some aspects of quality that we would find attractive if we can find the right opportunities, things like strong tower siding, regulatory regimes, certainly strength of the wireless carriers in the market and a relative balance to their market share, stability of the currency, stability of the tax regime, things like that would be things that we would find valuable. Because at the end of the day, sort of the value proposition of a tower company when most people look at it is this expectation that you have a long-term, very stable cash flow stream that is going to grow both steadily over time. And sometimes if you're in places that don't have some of those attributes I just mentioned, you can introduce a certain amount of volatility that we would be looking to obviously try to move out of the mix and focus more on that kind of stable growing cash flow stream. So I think we're open to shift in the type of market, but I think the markets that we're in have opportunities to improve our positioning and that's what we're looking at.
Matt Niknam: Is there a time frame attached to the strategic review?
Brendan Cavanagh: It's something that I would expect us to be working on throughout this year, but there are also factors that are outside of our control, things that we would like to do. That may take some time to figure out whether the opportunity is actually exist. So I think it will be an ongoing effort. But the real point -- and this isn't some wholesale change just to kind of reiterate that. It's not like we were doing something totally one way before, we completely shifted. This is more of a refinement of the approach that SBA has historically taken. We've always -- I think you know us to have always focused on quality, financial returns. All those things are still the same. What this really is, is kind of digging in a little bit deeper on some of our current holdings and looking at where we're underperforming, what are the root causes of that and what can we do to address that? And if we can't -- if we don't feel we can address it, then we would look at it like Argentina and say, "Hey, this we don't think we necessarily can fix so we'll adjust". So again, it's really just a refinement of what has been our long-standing policy.
Matt Niknam: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Hi, I just wanted to ask about the pacing of the services revenue through the year. And then another question on -- in terms of new activity. How much of it is coming from colocation versus amendments? And do you expect any significant change through the year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. The services revenue, we actually, in our outlook, expect it to slightly increase, but to be relatively balanced throughout the year. On the colos versus amendments, if you're -- I don't know if you're asking about the actuals of the fourth quarter, where it was more -- we've seen more of a shift towards new leases, but I would expect as we get into this year, you'll see amendment activity again be the lion's share of what we do.
Richard Choe: Got it. And a final one is in terms of Argentina, can you quantify what the impact would have been to revenue and EBITDA had you kept it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. It was -- it represented about $1 million of EBITDA and a little over $2 million, about $2.3 million of revenue on an annual basis.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Michael Elias with TD Cowen.
Michael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First time caller, long time listener here. My first question for you is, you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks about the stability of results. I'm curious if on the US side that we should take that to mean you're more open to doing what's holistic MLAs with the carriers that you have with AT&T. That's my first question. And then the second question is when you talked about the use of cash, you were essentially mentioning that you assume the remainder is reinvested at around 4%. So when I take a look at the AFFO yield of your stock, it's implying over 6%. You talked about earlier how you may hold back if you see some opportunities. I guess what I'm getting at here is, are you holding back on the buyback under the expectation that you're going to go forward and do more M&A? Just trying to get some more color in terms of what you're thinking on the buybacks versus the M&A. Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: So on holistic MLAs, I think that is a -- when we talk about a goal of trying to ensure that we have stabilized our cash flow streams and results, one of the ways you do that is through enhancing and improving customer relationships. And that can be done in part through master agreements. We obviously signed one with AT&T last year. We've signed others in the past with each of our customers along the way. So I would expect we will continue to make use of that, assuming that it's the best structure for what our customers need to get done and SBA is able to achieve a certain amount of certainty and length of commitment as part of those agreements. But each of those will be determined on an individual basis based on the needs of the customer and what we need. Again, the buybacks versus M&A, yeah, I mean, we are -- we're not necessarily sitting here saying we've got all this cash we're ready to spend on buybacks. We are -- in fact, we still have balances out on our revolver. So I don't feel like we've necessarily been in that position. We have historically been very opportunistic around share buybacks. I would expect that to continue to be the case now. But individual acquisition opportunities, particularly of size, may influence our timing on when we would buy back our stock if we otherwise saw it as an attractive investment. So that's where we are, and we'll see as time goes by. But just because you don't see us buy back our stock doesn't necessarily mean that we don't see it as a good value. It means there may be other factors we're considering.
Michael Elias: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just -- it's been asked a few ways but maybe to put it in a different term. Can you talk a little bit about what is assumed in the $42 million of domestic leasing guidance that relates to kind of the lap-over effective signings in 2023 versus what you need to sign in 2024 itself?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I can't tell you exactly with precision sitting here, but I'm sure we can follow up with you. It is largely based on what's already been signed up to date. I'm sure it's somewhere in the three quarters range of the number, but maybe even more. So we'll follow up with you, Brendan, separately on that.
Brendan Lynch: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you. And then one other question on international churn. I know you were expecting some churn in some Latin American markets. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing there. It did seem to tick up a bit in the fourth quarter and give some color on what you anticipate throughout the next year.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So I mentioned it briefly in my prepared comments, but there are a number of markets that we're in where we have consolidations taking place, in particular, in Brazil where you had the Oi wireless consolidation with the other big three carriers there as we kind of work through that. Last year, that was a big factor. It represented roughly 40%. It was just from 10% by itself, associated with that consolidation, there's one item. That is probably going to be a continued driver of some level of international churn over the next few years. But we're working through negotiations with each of our customers. And as we do that, we're kind of pricing this long-term relationship, long-term commitment where we've got stability that we can reintroduce into the relationship, but allow them to get through the efficiencies that they need to achieve as a result of the combination of customers that's taking place in the market. So it's a mix, but Brazil will probably be the biggest just because it's the biggest market we have with the most revenue.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Thanks. I guess just a quick follow-on for that one. In your discussions with those customers, is there an opportunity with Mobile and maybe take ownership of those towers? Do you think there would be some regulatory issues with that?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I probably can't answer that in this forum, Walt. But we do have ongoing conversations with them about all different things that they do that we do that might fit together. So -- go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Just looking through history, you go back to Oi and then you look at PGE and you maxed the balance sheet at like $7.7 million. Is that coincidental? Or is that kind of your threshold of pain in terms of where you would take something for the opportunities that exist out there?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, it's probably coincidental to some degree. I don't think you'd see us go above 8x at any point in our history. But now that we've got this -- we've got a pretty big cushion given where our leverage has come down to. So I don't really foresee that ever being a number that we approach.
Walter Piecyk: Okay. Well, that gives us a sense of the size of things that you can consider. And then just lastly, just kind of a touchy-feely question, which is these operators have a lot of spectrum, which makes it a little different than past capital cycles when there's kind of an ebb and flow. What gives you confidence that when this ebb turns to flow, it’s not only going to be in markets where it can be satisfied with rooftops and small cells as opposed to traditional areas where densification is required? I'm talking domestically, forget about your global markets.
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, what -- I mean, really what gives me confidence, but we'll see how it plays out, its history. I mean, every time we've seen the cycle of activity, it's ultimately gotten to the suburban markets, the rural markets. Those dense urban centers really were never tower markets to begin with. So it's not really been a factor for us. Anything that's getting resolved with root tops, that's a very limited tower market. So I'm not sure it matters that much to us.
Walter Piecyk: So are there factors that in suburbia that you could hit or not you, but like, let's say, TMS, Verizon, maybe AT&T jumps on board. They hit enough penetration that the depth of spectrum that they have from C-band and the Sprint spectrum is not enough to serve whatever, let's call it, 30% penetration that they would require additional identification.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Walter Piecyk: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next we will hear from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Hey, thanks. Sticking with the US on the $40-ish million in new leasing activity expected in '24, is this level of the new run rate we should expect as we model out over the next few years? Or do you think there's a chance that new leasing levels might reach what we saw in '22 and '23, again? And then the second question was, could you just comment on the discretionary CapEx spend for '24? It looked like it stepped up pretty meaningfully from '23, what drove that increase?
Brendan Cavanagh: So the leasing level into the future, yeah, we think it could go up, sure. Obviously, it's all driven by carrier activity. I mean if you go back over the last three years, David, you will see, if you go back a few years ago, that we were at a level very similar to where we are now. In fact, I think we reported a number lower than the $42 million that we just put in our outlook for this year, three, four years ago. So since that time, obviously, it spiked up much higher than that because of carrier activity. And I think to some degree, the network strain that they may feel the -- and the cost of capital is very impactful to the decisions they're making there. And so yes, we believe there's definitely opportunity to see the number go higher in future years, but we need to see how that moves. In the case of -- I'm sorry, your other question was on CapEx?
David Guarino: Correct.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I think -- I don't believe -- I believe what we guided to was similar to what last year's number was. Yeah it’s where we guided to, $330 million at the midpoint and last year, it was $310 million. So sorry, Dave, what do you -- what's the core of the question?
David Guarino: No, my apologies, I must have misread that wrong. If it's flat, you can disregard the question.
Brendan Cavanagh: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, on -- AT&T recently signed a new contract with FirstNet. Can you provide color if that will be included within the current M&A you have with them or provide some upside? And just another one on M&A. As you think about increasing your portfolio, do you have a preference for carrier-owned towers versus portfolios that are coming out of independent tower operators? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. With regards to AT&T FirstNet, for the most part, I would expect, based on my understanding of everything that is expected to happen there, that it would have limited upside for us from an amendment or upgrade standpoint, the opportunity set would be more based on a need to densify where they needed to actually have new lease agreements at existing sites or possibly even new tower builds. So it's really a new site leasing opportunity to the extent that there is an impact, but I do not think there's much of an amendment impact potential for us. With regards to the M&A question, we would -- generally speaking, I would say we would prefer independent tower company towers as opposed to carrier owned towers, usually, we find that they've been developed with the mindset of co-location already in there, and they are operated and maintained in a way typically that is better than what you find with the traditional carrier sale leaseback. But having said that, we've done both kinds of deals, and I think our what we bring to the table is our expertise that allows us to kind of improve those operations. Sometimes there's greater opportunity for improvement when you buy things that haven't been run quite as well. So I guess it just depends on the individual opportunity.
Batya Levi: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time.
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, great. Thank you, everybody, for taking the time, and we look forward to reporting to you next quarter.
Operator: And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from expectations. Our statements are as of today, November 2, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our third quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another very solid quarter in Q3, with financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Based on these results and our updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share, notwithstanding weaker forecasted foreign currency exchange rates than we had previously expected. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $637.5 million and cash site leasing revenues were $630.4 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a headwind of approximately $1.4 million when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, and a benefit of $4.8 million when compared to the third quarter of 2022. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the third quarter of 2022, including the impact of 4.1% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.8%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 8.6% on a gross basis, and 4.7% on a net basis, including 3.9% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter was up materially from the second quarter, primarily as a result of the AT&T master lease agreement signed in July. Excluding the impact of the AT&T MLA, third quarter activity levels were similar to the second quarter. All major carriers remain active with their networks. However, agreement execution levels continue to be slower than a year ago. The higher cost of capital naturally has caused a focus on cash management and expense control by our customers. This dynamic extends the timing over which 5G-related network investments are being made. There is still a long way to go for 5G network investments based on the number of our sites that remain to be upgraded with mid-band spectrum deployments by the major mobile network operators. Wireless data use continues to grow materially, and that fact, combined with the limited spectrum availability will require additional infrastructure over time to maintain and certainly to enhance service quality. This gives us great confidence in continued domestic organic leasing growth for many years to come. During the third quarter, domestic churn was slightly below our prior projections due to a slower pace of decommissioning of legacy Sprint leases than we had projected. Our overall expectations for Sprint related churn remain the same, but there will likely continue to be small variations in timing of realizing this churn over the next several years. We currently expect Sprint related churn for 2023 to be $28 million. 2024 Sprint related churn is currently estimated to be approximately $30 million. Non-Sprint related domestic churn was in line with our prior projections and continues to range between 1% and 2% of our domestic leasing revenue. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, third quarter same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.5% net, including 4.9% of churn or 9.4% on a gross basis. International leasing activity remained strong in the third quarter and was again ahead of our internal expectations. While global macroeconomic conditions present challenges to our carrier customers, we have continued to see pockets of dedicated network investment across a number of our markets. The desire and need for enhanced wireless coverage and quality of service continues to be elevated internationally, and we expect will continue to drive leasing opportunities across our portfolio. Wireless data growth in our international markets is even greater than the U.S. We also continue to see steady contributions from inflation-based escalators in many of our markets. In Brazil, our largest international market, the same-tower organic growth rate was 2.6% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 6.3% of churn, which growth rate reflects a decline in the Brazilian inflationary index. The net growth rate was also again significantly impacted by our previously discussed TIM agreement. As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation other than that associated with the TIM agreement. However, we continue to discuss potential arrangements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that could have an impact on our current year international churn. During the third quarter, 77.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 12.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $511.7 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85.3%, and an international tower cash flow margin of 70%, or 91.5% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $482.1 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 71.4% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 76.9%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. During the third quarter, our services business had another solid quarter, with $45.1 million in revenue, and $13.6 million of segment operating profit. While off last year's all-time high activity levels, we continued to execute on our backlog of high quality, high margin work and deliver for our carrier customers. However, given the slower pace of carrier network related activity across the industry, we have lowered our full year outlook for our site development business by $15 million at the midpoint. Notwithstanding this adjustment, we continue to manage our costs and focus on high-margin work. And thus, we have not lowered our expected margin contributions to 2023 adjusted EBITDA and AFFO from our services business. We still expect 2023 to be the second largest services revenue year in our history, trailing only 2022. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the third quarter was $364.1 million. AFFO per share was $3.34, an increase of 7.7% over the third quarter of 2022. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in additions to our portfolio, acquiring 45 communication sites for total cash consideration of $40.8 million, and building 86 new sites. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 215 sites, all of which are in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $74 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter of 2024. In addition to new towers, we also continued to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Before I turn things over to Mark, I'd like to take a quick moment to welcome Marc Montagner, who joined our team in mid-October, and will be taking over as our new CFO on January 1. Marc brings with him an extensive background in telecommunications and finance, and we are very excited to have him as part of the team. I also would be remiss if I did not take a moment to recognize that this call is Jeff's final earnings call as CEO of SBA. I have big shoes to fill, and I am grateful for the professional guidance and the friendship he has extended to me over the last 25 years. And with that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt, and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.4x, 0.2 turns lower than last quarter, and the lowest level of decades. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense increased to 5.1x. During and subsequent to quarter-end, we repaid amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have a $285 million outstanding balance under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.2 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.5%. Including our interest rate hedging position, the interest rate on 95% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During and subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $100 million at an average price per share of $197.89. We currently have $404.7 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company’s shares outstanding at September 30, 2023 were $108.1 million. In addition, during the quarter we declared and paid a cash dividend of $92.1 million, or $0.85 per share. And today we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.85 per share that’s payable on December 14, 2023 to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 16, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the year ago period and only represents 26% of our projected full year AFFO. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. We continue to execute well in the third quarter. We produced financial results ahead of external and internal expectations. And we continue to be a valued partner to our carrier customers in helping them to meet their network objectives. Each of our largest U.S. customers continued to add equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands as well as to expand coverage through brand new colocations. Although current activity levels are below the pace of the last couple of years, we have continued to steadily organically grow our revenues and tower cash flow. Even in a slower than typical demand environment wireless carriers still have a constant need to invest in expanding and enhancing their networks. By leveraging our high quality assets and providing them quality services support, we have been able to continue growing our business relationship with each of our major customers. In addition, we are confident there will be additional material network investment over the next several years as wireless data usage continues to grow materially. The growth in wireless demand is not slowing down and networks will continue to be strained and our customers still have significant mid-band spectrum holdings that need to be deployed with little additional spectrum plan for release anytime soon. Macro tower sites are still the most efficient and effective way to deliver wireless connectivity, and our focus on high quality portfolio will make us a key participant in network growth for many years to come. Internationally, we also had another solid quarter with greater organic leasing activity than we had anticipated. We again experienced strong contributions broadly from many of our markets, including Central America, Brazil and South Africa. Brazil, our largest market outside of the U.S. was again ahead of our internal expectations, and each of the big three carriers in that market remained busy with coverage expansion, densification and integration of the legacy Oi wireless network. Lease up across many of our Central American markets was also ahead of expectations and evidences the need of our customers to meet the constantly growing demand of wireless customers for wireless data in those markets. I am pleased with our operational execution internationally, and I am optimistic for the future based on significant network needs across many of our markets. During the third quarter, we again generated very healthy AFFO, providing strong dividend coverage and significant cash for discretionary allocation. During the quarter, we allocated capital to the dividend and new site additions through both acquisitions and new tower builds, selectively adding high quality sites that we believe will be additive to our organic growth in future years. We also spent $100 million on share repurchases at prices we believe represent a very good value and will produce a nice return over time. We also continue paying down the outstanding balance on our revolver. We immediately benefited from this by reducing some of our highest rate cash interest obligations. The reduction in our outstanding debt, along with our continued solid growth in adjusted EBITDA produced a quarter ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.4x, which I believe is the lowest level ever in our public company history. Even with continued portfolio growth, stock repurchases and growing dividends, we have reduced our leverage by almost one full turn in the last 18 months, demonstrating the deleveraging power of our business. At this leverage level, we believe we have the near-term optionality to achieve an investment grade rating. However, for the time being, we are maintaining flexibility in order to comfortably assess all capital allocation options. Going forward, we expect to continue growing our dividend at a rate higher than the rate of growth of our AFFO over the next several years, while maintaining a low AFFO payout ratio. For the time being, excess future cash flows will likely be directed into the repayment of debt, as it is the most accretive short-term and is also beneficial long-term, but we will of course, also stay opportunistic around portfolio opportunities and additional stock buybacks. Our balance sheet remains in great shape with no debt maturities until October 2024, and we have the capacity to satisfy that repayment entirely with cash flow from operations or availability under our revolver. We continue to have very good access to capital, and thus are comfortable to be opportunistic around the timing of future financings. Overall, we feel very good about our current capital position. As Brendan mentioned earlier, this represents my final earnings call as CEO of SBA. I have participated in approximately 100 of these calls over the years. I have been honored to be the leader of this organization for the past 22 years and appreciative of the time I have spent with many of you on this call. Thank you for your support and goodwill throughout this very enjoyable ride. I will retire with the comfort and satisfaction of knowing SBA is a great company, in great shape, and with a management team that I know will lead it to new heights. I want to conclude by thanking our team members and our customers for their contributions to our shared success. And with that, Eric, we’re ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And one moment please for our first question. And our first question goes to Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: Thanks very much. And Jeff, I want to wish you all the best. And maybe a question for you given your tenure in the industry. Your company and many of your peers have seen kind of a lot of changes. I think your company at one point was doing shared wireless backhaul. You’ve gone into data centers, you’ve evaluated things like outdoor DAS. But anything about the sector as you see it on your way out of the company as an active observer, I imagine. But any kind of broad brush structural changes that you see affecting the tower model or anything ancillary to that that we should be looking for as investors? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: I would say over my 25, 26 years, Jon, there’s been a steady connection between growth in wireless demand and necessary infrastructure. And I think that really has its roots in the laws of physics and the way radio spectrum works. We’ve seen cycles that have repeated themselves over time. The current cycle feels like it’s going to be a bit more elongated than perhaps some of the prior cycles, as I think our customers are demonstrating. Not that they didn’t demonstrate fiscal prudence over the years, but it seems to be a particularly higher priority than racing to deploy spectrum, which they will own, and deploy it when they need it. But the basics haven’t really changed that much. We haven’t seen any technology that really will obsolete the basic tower business model. We watch satellites and things like that, and we watch small cells. And the macro site really continues to be the backbone of wireless communications. And the conversations we have with our customers tell us that they expect macro sites to continue to be the backbone. So I think there’s always ups and downs and twists and turns, but directionally it remains pretty much the way it was many years ago.
Jon Atkin: Great. That’s great perspective. And thinking forward over the next year or so, Brendan, I guess would be directed towards you. But kind of the operating trends and the demand drivers, any sense as to kind of the cadence that one might see as this spectrum gets further deployed and the kind of the 5G journey continues on behalf of the M&Os?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think, Jon, we’ll see in the early part of heading into next year that things will probably be lower than they’ve been. But I would expect to see that increase over time. And it really base that answer mostly on the needs that our customers have. There's still quite a bit of spectrum that has to be deployed on our sites. There are some deadlines out there for certain of our customers that they need to meet. And just based on conversations that we have with them, suggest that there's still a ton of work to be done. But I think, as Jeff kind of alluded to, in the current moment in time, there's a little bit more of a focus on financial constraints and cost control. But I think that naturally will start to give way to network needs as mobile and wireless data consumption increases. So, I would expect that we'll see it start to move up as we get into the middle of next year.
Jon Atkin: Thanks very much and all the best, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question goes to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks, good afternoon everybody. Jeff, I think I've been on 96 of those 100 earnings calls with you. So I'll echo Jonathan's comments. And have fun with the grandkids and your charity work I know you're so active with.
Jeff Stoops: Well, thank you, Ric. We had a good run together.
Ric Prentiss: Yes. I want to come to a couple of items. The dividend policy. I appreciate the comments on that, dividend rate over the growth rate of AFFO. Some of the others in the space are looking at the dividend policy, should it be tied more towards the qualified REIT subsidiary, kind of minimum that you have to do versus total AFFO. How should we think about you all looking at kind of the dividend versus qualified REIT subsidiary versus total AFFO, and as you think about the payout ratio over time?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We're fortunate to be in the position that we're in, where we actually still have fairly sizable NOLs, which gives us some flexibility there, Ric. But as – you kind of look at it as, you produce a certain amount of taxable income, and we satisfy it through a mix of using NOLs and paying out dividends and in order to maintain our REIT compliance. And so by starting when we did, it has allowed us to continue to grow our dividend at a pace that I think is fairly high across most REITs, and will allow us to continue to do that to some degree, it's certainly at a pace greater than the AFFO per share growth. Until we reach a point at which we will have exhausted those NOLs, and at that point, I would expect we'll pay a dividend that is – whatever is necessary to comply with our REIT requirements. So that's kind of the way we look at it. What that means, based on our projections is that we'll continue to have nice growth in our dividend over the coming years. And we'll be able to keep our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO fairly low, which gives us a lot of flexibility on other discretionary uses for that capital.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I think, Rick, the reason we haven't broken out total AFFO versus just AFFO from requalifying income that dividend is calculated, is we're not close to any of those levels. I mean, I think our philosophy will never change, which is we're only going to pay out what we have to on that calculation. And it also kind of confuses people if we introduced another metric. It's just, I think, easier for people to understand and think about when we're using AFFO. But we have a long way to go before we get to the point where we've exhausted our NOLs. And that gives us the ability to increase dividends faster than perhaps others. But at the same time, we're watching the total payout as a percentage of AFFO. And we're going to be able to do both, keep a lower relative payout ratio and increase the dividend at a faster pace for the next several years.
Ric Prentiss: Makes sense. You mentioned that you think, possibly, the levels you're at lowest, decades, if not, ever publicly in the mid-6% range. How should we think about what investment grade means to you, if you were to pursue it? What kind of level – you've always been kind of a levered capital appreciation story. But obviously, the interest rate environment we're in has caused people to always look through things. But how should we think about your view on leverage and interest rates? And then that calculus that allowed you to do stock buyback this quarter?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So as you alluded to, obviously, the broader environment, in terms of rates and cost of capital, is certainly influencing the trajectory of our leverage levels lately. And really, it's a combination of a couple of things. It's the overall cost, but it's also the relationship to the opportunities in front of us in terms of investing capital and what we see as the potential return on those items. And we haven't seen an appropriate adjustment, I guess, in the price points for some of that investment relative to the shift in the cost of capital. And so as a result, the best use of the cost of capital, most of the time, is to pay off some of our debt. And as you know, we had balances outstanding on our revolver. And so it's easy for us to just pay that down as the use of capital, and given that it's floating rate, it's some of our highest cost debt. So we will continue to do that. But at the same time, we're going to look to be opportunistic around opportunities to invest that capital, and the stock buybacks are representative of that. We started to see our stock trading down to levels where we just felt that it was an appropriate time to jump in, and it would be certainly accretive to us. Both in the short term and over the long term, we would expect to invest a little bit of capital into the buyback. So I think, as we think forward, longer term, we haven't necessarily targeted being investment grade, but the leverage has continued to drop. And that's one of the great things about this business, you continue to grow EBITDA, and it naturally – as we produce a lot of free cash flow, you naturally start to delever quickly. And so we're approaching those levels now where we certainly could move towards investment grade. But as we mentioned in our scripted comments, we are going to maintain that flexibility for the time being and see how things go. And if we decide that, that's a better way to go in terms of improving our cost of capital, then we have that optionality to do it. And if not, and there's other places to invest that we think are going to produce greater returns for our shareholders, we'll go that direction.
Ric Prentiss: Great. One quick one on my end. I think you mentioned Sprint share now expected to be $30 million in 2024. Has that previously been thought it was going to be kind of in the double digit, maybe $10 million to $15 million? And settling – can you kind of update on what you think of 2025, 2026, 2027 Sprint churns [ph]?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think last quarter, we gave you a range that was around $20 million to $30 million. And so by saying $30 million now, we're seeing it a little bit lower here as we end this year. But the total is still the same. When we originally were giving guidance, we expected to see a little bit more in 2025 and 2026. And now we're thinking 2025 is probably a little bit lower. So again, the total number is going to be basically the same, Ric. It's just trying to pinpoint exactly the timing from year-to-year is – it's been a little bit challenging to do with that kind of precision. But I think we've been pretty close.
Ric Prentiss: Right. Okay. Again, best wishes, Jeff and Marc. Look forward to hearing Marc with the CFO. Look forward to hearing from you next quarter.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Ric.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Thank you very much. And Jeff, also my best, will miss you on these calls and your insights on the industry. A couple of things. You talked a lot about the demand being subdued, given the financial conditions in the market. To what extent are things like the FCC not having the spectrum authority to release some spectrum, the dual-band radio issue. Do you think any of those might get solved here in the near term that might be holding back some spending, or even just a turn off the calendar from year-end 2023 and to 2024? And then you did some M&A in the quarter. It would be great just to get some broader thoughts on the M&A environment. I think we've heard in the past, just a big difference between public and private multiples, but it'd be great to get any color on what you were able to find in the market and what you see out there today? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I think the FCC spectrum authority issue has to be resolved here soon. At the same time, the FCC has lost their spectrum authority. The White House and other governmental agencies are trying to plot and figure out long-term spectrum availability. So – and everybody knows it needs to get done, and it will. And I believe, by the time it has been done or will be done, Simon, the dual-band 3.45 and C-band equipment will be ready to go. So that's absolutely something that we think will contribute to next year's leasing. But there's a lot of spectrum still, and we think about things as a percentage of completion or deployment of certain spectrum bands on our towers. There's just a lot left to go. And I think it just shows that our customers are being fiscally prudent and waiting and looking for the right return results before they deploy. But ultimately, they have to deploy, unless the connection between growth in wireless data and the need for physical infrastructure has somehow changed, and that hasn't changed since the beginning of wireless. I'll let Brendan handle your M&A question.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So on the M&A environment, we continue to see a very competitive environment. Notwithstanding where public valuations have gone, private valuations continue to remain elevated. And to the comments that I made earlier, that's obviously influence where we've directed some of our capital. So in the U.S., in particular, pricing is staying high. And even internationally, we're seeing that to some degree. Although I would say, internationally, there's perhaps been less in the market. There's still a ton out there of potential supply, but I think that sellers are being a little more cautious in their timing of bringing things to market.
Simon Flannery: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question goes to Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you so much. Jeff, I wish you all the best as well. I had a question on the leasing growth activity. You mentioned that it has been slowing down. Can you provide some sense if it has slowed down even more than what you had expected a few months ago? And the AT&T MLA is providing some visibility when the activity is coming down. Can you provide some color, maybe if you're – if there is appetite from your other tenants to replicate similar deals and how you would approach them? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. The leasing growth, I wouldn't say that it's really all that different than what we thought three months ago when we talked about it. It's perhaps slower than what we thought at the beginning of the year than we were originally thinking how this year would play out. But what we described last quarter, it's staying pretty much in line with that expectation that we laid out. And you could see that even in the guidance that we gave, where we didn't make any changes there. On the AT&T MLA and it's the potential for that with others. We have master agreements in place with other carriers. The form of those agreements can vary among the carriers, but it's really dependent upon the needs of that specific customer, and what works best for them and for us and creates the best win-win situation given what they're trying to accomplish in that particular negotiation. So I would say that we are certainly open to agreements with others over time as they're needed, and we have those conversations all the time. Exactly how they're structured may very well vary though, depending on the carriers' needs.
Batya Levi: Got it. And one quick follow-up; I think you mentioned that the activity on putting 5G equipment on towers is still pretty low. Roughly 1% of your towers have seen that deployment?
Brendan Cavanagh: Using the 5G-related spectrum it's approximately 50%.
Batya Levi: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks. And Jeff, I also want to extend my thanks and best wishes as you move on to your next chapter.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Mike.
Michael Rollins: Welcome. And just curious as we shift over to maybe the international side for a few more minutes; have you thought about alternative ways to structure those operations? Or is there a need at some level to adjust the market structure of what you have over time to create greater scale or find some ancillary opportunities for growth in those markets where they may not be structured similar to the U.S.?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I don't know if it's necessarily structure. I would agree with your reference to scale, that in markets where we have scale, we've seen the benefits of that in our relationships with the carrier customers in those markets, and our ability to be more impactful in their projects for build-outs that they have. So scale is something that we're definitely paying attention to within these markets. And then in terms of other things that we might add, in some of these places, there are opportunities to provide incremental services that are somehow related or associated with what we currently do that add sort of an extra level of value that we're able to provide. It generates additional revenue streams that but it also kind of strengthens that relationship for a longer period of time. So we're exploring that. We're doing some things around C-RAN hubs, some things around power, some things around security in certain of our markets and we'll continue to explore those opportunities.
Michael Rollins: And just one other question. In past moments where there's been some uncertainty, whether it's in the operating environment or financial environment, the company has provided a North Star in terms of a metric or a guide or an aspiration that you were targeting. And just given some of the questions on leasing activity and what it might mean for growth rates over the next few years, is there a range or an average domestic organic growth rate that SBA is targeting, aspiring to that would be helpful for investors to be mindful of?
Brendan Cavanagh: No, there's not a specific target. I think, excluding Sprint churn, I would expect that we'll be able to produce mid-single digits growth rate in the U.S. But at this point, we're not comfortable to lay out a long-term target. And some of that, Mike, just to be clear, it's – there are a lot of factors that really aren't about wireless needs. If it was just about what do our customers need to do in terms of their network deployments, we perhaps would be able to do that a little bit more comfortably. I think some of these factors around cost of capital and other things that may affect timing of when our customers are spending influence that. So that just leads us to be a little bit more cautious in kind of naming specific targets.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey. Jeff, first of all I just want to echo others' comments and thank you for all the time you spent with us, and all the insights you shared with us over the years. I really appreciate that.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Nick.
Nick Del Deo: Jeff, you emphasized in your comments that the carriers will need to invest to support traffic growth over time, just like they always have. I don't think many people dispute that. I guess, is there any reason to think that they have more capacity runway today than they have typically had over the years, given the amount of 5G spectrum they've rolled out? Or do you not believe that's the case?
Jeff Stoops: I do believe that there's a lot of spectrum out there, which is why now all of the three largest carriers have now all, or either have, or are beginning to deploy fixed wireless. Don't know that, that technology's been available in the last generation, it would have worked out. I mean, just on that point, from some things that I've read, the fixed wireless subscriber takes up 20 times to 30 times the wireless – the spectrum capacity. So I mean, it's statistics like that, Nick, that give us great confidence that over time, the connection that's existed forever, at least as long as I've been around, the connection between wireless data growth and the need for additional physical infrastructure is going to continue. But yes, I mean there's a lot of spectrum out there now, but it's rapidly getting used up. And it's going to continue to rapidly get used up the more success that the customers have with fixed wireless.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Okay. And then I also thought it was interesting that you lowered your site development revenue forecast, but you left the bottom line contribution unchanged, which implies a pretty – a not insignificant bump in your expected margin. So I guess, can you talk about what's behind that dynamic and how sustainable it might be as we look into the coming year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I don't – I think, Nick, it does speak to the higher-margin type work that we're doing. I'm not sure that it's sustainable at that same level that we are experiencing right at the moment. Some of that is really tied to an estimate of costs as we put these jobs on the books, and we're ending up actually finding ways to operate more efficiently and come in at lower cost levels. And then as you kind of true-up [ph] those jobs, since they're accounted for on a percentage of completion basis that helps. But I think, it just is evidence of our intent to focus on high-quality, high-margin work, and we'll continue to do that. But I don't know that 30% margins are the story for the long-term.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Thank you. I just wanted to echo best wishes for Jeff in retirement. Brendan, I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on how you kind of prepare the balance sheet for the debt maturity staff that's coming due in a more material way in 2025. I know you don't have to make a decision on that today whether you'll pursue investment grade. But just how might that impact your capital allocation policy into 2024 as you kind of look at the puts and takes of buybacks, M&A or further deleveraging with excess cash?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Well, first of all, I think that we have tremendous access to capital. So from a refinancing perspective, I'm not concerned about that. We're actively evaluating all of our options there. And I'm confident that there are numerous markets available to us. Obviously, the costs are higher than they've been in the past. But in terms of access to capital, so that – that part of it doesn't concern me. I think, when we think about allocation of capital, though, it really is just a matter of what is the best return on investment, what is going to create the most shareholder value. So that sounds simplistic. But ultimately, that's what we're looking at. And so if we can use our capital, and maybe our leverage goes a little bit higher, which it's been in the past, certainly, because we see opportunities to invest that capital into either buybacks or new assets, we'll do that. We'd like to do that. But recently, we found that paying down debt has been the better way to go. And at some point, we'll be at a level where it's just going to be a natural shift. If that doesn't change, will be the natural shift to investment grade. And then it's just a matter of finding the right instruments that fit our capital structure to allow us to retain flexibility, but also get the best cost possible.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I think said differently, if we continue to operate the way we have the last couple of quarters, we naturally will have the optionality of being an investment-grade issuer. That really, for us, is not so much more a matter of material leverage reduction as it is commitments and policy changes and things like that. We would, of course, before we materially increase leverage for allocation of capital, we would think long and hard about whether that was the right thing to do in advance of 2025. But it kind of is on a path. And Eric, we think, as we look around the world, look at portfolio pricing and things like that, it's very likely that we end 2024 at a lower leverage level, or certainly not a higher leverage level, than where we end 2023.
Eric Luebchow: Okay. I appreciate that color. And just one follow-up question. Just quickly on domestic churn. I think, excluding the Sprint churn, you'll be at about $30 million this year, maybe around 2% of your revenues. And it's been in that ballpark for the last couple of years. As you look further out over the next few years, are there opportunities to bring that run rate churn level lower? We've heard from some peers about some of their run rate tower churn moving closer to 1% of revenue. Thanks. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I do think, Eric, there's definitely opportunities to bring it lower. For one, a big chunk of that is due to kind of smaller customers that frankly, as you start to have less and less of them or they are less of a percentage of our business, obviously, there's less opportunity or supply for that churn. And then with our agreements with some of our bigger customers, I would expect that any churn that's come from them will be significantly reduced as well.
Eric Luebchow: Okay. Great to hear. Thank you guys. 
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question and Jeff, want to echo everyone's congratulations as well. Maybe we could just start with the international market. You kind of described demand being above your internal expectations. And a component of that, I believe you mentioned, was the escalators. But if I understand correctly, those are more backward looking. So I'd imagine that you have pretty good visibility on that for the year. So maybe you could just get into some of the other drivers that are driving the international exposure and international profitability higher than what you had been expecting?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. The above expectations comment was specifically associated with new leasing revenue signed up through new leases and amendments. And that was – we kind of obviously target based on backlog, and what our market intelligence is telling us what we think those numbers are going to look like in each market. And on average, across our international business, we were successful in signing up more new business than – from a dollar standpoint than we originally expected. So that's that comment. And I think it's driven really just by the significant needs that certain of our customers have across our markets for all the basic things that we talked about before, continued expansion of both 4G and even a little bit of 5G coverage. The coverage that exists in these markets is not nearly where it is in the U.S., so there's much greater needs in some cases. And so we're seeing that play out in a number of our markets. The escalator piece is not really a part of that. That varies and just moves based on where inflation is, and in certain of our markets, inflation was – has been a little bit higher. So that's helped the growth rates stay elevated.
Brendan Lynch: Great. That's helpful. And maybe just one on the build-to-suit program. You had some more activity there in the quarter. Maybe just give us an update on where you see those opportunities over the next couple of quarters?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think there's – most of that is being done internationally, first of all. I'm sure you see that in our release. And that will probably continue to be the case. There's definitely opportunities for new builds, for the same reasons as I just mentioned. In responding to the previous question, there's just a lot of coverage needs that exist in these markets. The real question for us is just making sure that we're doing – we're making worthwhile investments, given the cost of capital that's increased, that we're building sites, that we're confident are going to make a nice return, and that usually requires the addition of a second tenant at some point over the next several years after you build the site. So we're pretty diligent in kind of watching those sites. I think opportunities exist. But we're going to be selective about where we build sites.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead. 
David Guarino: Hey, thanks. Brendan, I think this one will be for you. On the comment you made about U.S. tower validation staying high. Could you provide some more color on why you think that is? And I asked just because I guess I'm surprised, given we've had a pretty meaningful rise in interest rates over the last few months. While at the same time, we've had some concerns about lower macro tower growth that have emerged. So any additional color would be great.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think you've got a lot of different parties out there that have demands or their – their mission is to invest in digital infrastructure. And they have capital that's already been raised that needs to get deployed. And so I think that has – that plays a role in it. The supply, frankly, in the U.S. is somewhat limited, so there's still some competitive tension that exists there among many different parties that are investing. So that's really a driver. And so if you've got different return expectations, and you've got different views on what the growth profile of assets look like, you may be able to make a decision that's different than we're seeing the public companies, including SBA, make.
David Guarino: Yes. That's helpful. And the second one, maybe sticking with you. I'm guessing next year, you guys are going to be accessing the secured market to refinance some debt. And I know that, that's still a few quarters away. But could you maybe give us an idea of where secured borrowing costs sit today for tower assets?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean it depends on what market you're in. If you're talking about the ABS market, which has been our primary source of secured financing today, you'd be somewhere in the mid- to high 6s, would likely be where we play out.
David Guarino: Great. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Brandon Nispel: Hey, great. Just one for me. And hopefully, it haven't been asked. But Jeff, hope you could talk about what you're seeing during the quarter, more specifically from an activity perspective. Specifically, I was hoping you could help us understand where you are from a year-over-year perspective, from a backlog of unsigned lease applications, and how that trended versus last quarter? Thanks. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Brandon, we've – our backlogs are a little bit lower than they've been in the past. That – it probably shouldn't be a surprise, given the carriers' investment levels have been little bit slower as we've talked about. And obviously, executions have been down. The backlogs have trended in the same general direction. But it will be interesting to see how that plays out as we get into next year, as the carriers have new budgets in place and so forth. So for now, though, it's definitely trended down.
Brandon Nispel: Thanks. 
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time.
Jeff Stoops: Well, I usually sign off. But I'm going to let Brendan sign off.
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, thank you all for joining us. We appreciate it. And thank you, Jeff, again, for all of your years. Appreciate it.
Jeff Stoops: It's been an honor and a privilege. And I'm not able to say, as I have in my last 100, that we – that I look forward to talking to you next quarter. But you're in good hands.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks, everyone.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, July 31. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our second quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another steady quarter in Q2 with solid financial results that were slightly ahead of our expectations. Based on these results and our updated expectations for the balance of the year, we have increased our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter or $626.1 million and cash site leasing revenues were $618.7 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $1.9 million when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $4.2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2022. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.3% net over the second quarter of 2022 and including the impact of 3.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.2%. The Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.8% on a gross basis and 4.2% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter declined from the first quarter. While all major carriers remained active with their networks, agreement execution levels in the second quarter from several of our customers were below our prior expectations. Longer term, we continue to see significant runway for new 5G-related leasing activity based on the number of our sites that remain to be upgraded with mid-band spectrum deployments by the major mobile network operators. In addition, today, we announced that we have entered into a new long-term master lease agreement with AT&T. This comprehensive agreement will streamline AT&T's deployment of 5G solutions across our tower portfolio while providing us with committed future leasing growth from AT&T for years to come. Based on this MLA, we have increased our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from domestic organic new leases and amendments by $6 million from the full year projections we provided last quarter. During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 42% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 58%. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 89% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter. Domestically, churn was slightly elevated during the quarter, primarily due to faster decommissioning of legacy Sprint leases than we had projected which is the opposite of our experience last year. Based on our current analysis, we expect Sprint related churn for 2023 will be at the high end of our previously stated range for this year of $25 million to $30 million, resulting in a change to our full year domestic churn outlook of $4 million. Our views around the ultimate multiyear cumulative impact of Sprint merger-related churn have not changed. Although we continue to update our outlook around timing as more information becomes available. We now project 2024 Sprint related churn to be in a range of $20 million to $30 million, 2025 to be between $35 million and $45 million. 2026 to be $45 million to $55 million and 2027 to be $10 million to $20 million. Just as last year ended up being well below our initial churn expectations and 2023 will likely be a little above our initial expectations, we anticipate that the exact timing will continue to be somewhat fluid but in line with our provided projections. Non-Sprint-related domestic churn was in line with our prior projections. Moving now to international results. On a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.8% net, including 4.9% of churn or 9.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was strong in the second quarter and ahead of our internal expectations. These positive results and our solid backlogs have allowed us to increase our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from international organic new leases and amendments by $1 million. Inflation-based escalators also continued to make steady contributions to our organic growth. However, decreases in actual and projected Brazilian CPI rates have caused us to moderate our outlook for international escalation contributions for the full year by approximately $1 million. Overall, Brazil, our largest international market, had another very good quarter. The same tower organic growth rate in Brazil was 5.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.6% of churn which amount was significantly impacted by our previously discussed TIM agreement. While international churn remains elevated, it continues to be in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook. As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the OI consolidation other than that associated with the TAM agreement. However, if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the oil consolidation that would be expected to have an impact on our current year we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. During the second quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.2% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 13.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $503.5 million, Tower cash flow in the quarter benefited by approximately $7.3 million in accounting-driven cost reclassifications. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85.5% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.3% or 92.3%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $471.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.9%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. During the second quarter, our services business had another strong quarter with $52.4 million in revenue and $13.1 million of segment operating profit. While off year ago activity levels, our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G-related equipment during the quarter and we have retained our full year outlook for our site development business due in part to the strength of our first half results. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the second quarter was $352.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.24, an increase of 6.2% over the second quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in additions to our portfolio, acquiring 9 communication sites for total cash consideration of $7.2 million and building 64 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 134 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $72.9 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites and during the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $10.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion of total debt and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.6x. And below the low end of our target range and the lowest level in decades. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a strong 4.9x. During a subsequent to quarter end, we repaid amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have $360 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.5 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance was 6.3%. The interest rate of 95% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock, choosing instead to reduce revolver balances. We currently have $505 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at June 30, 2023, were $108.4 million. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $92.1 million or $0.85 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.85 per share payable on September 20, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 24, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend we paid in the year ago period. and only 26% of our projected full year AFFO. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. The second quarter was another very solid one for SBA. We produced good financial results across all areas of our business and we continue to deliver high-quality service and operating results for our customers. Each of our largest U.S. customers remained active with their networks. Our customers continue to add equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands as well as to expand coverage through brand new colocations. We did, however, see the same slowdown in activity that many others have discussed. While we had always anticipated domestic leasing growth to moderate as we move through 2023 and organic leasing activity levels were lower than we anticipated in Q2 from some of our customers. Some of this was due, we believe, to slower activity from AT&T in anticipation of our new MLA as would be expected. We believe that these variations in activity are part of the normal cycle of carrier network investment that we have seen over time, a large initial burst of coverage activity as the next generation of technology starts to be deployed, followed by many years of coverage completion and capacity building. We are confident that there will be additional material network investment over the next several years. We believe this for a number of reasons. Most importantly, wireless demand continues to grow at a fast clip, consuming more and more of current network capacity. We have a large remaining number of sites that have not been upgraded yet to accommodate the mid-band spectrum holdings acquired by our customers over the last couple of years, some of which spectrum is not even available for deployment yet. DISH has their next phase of regulatory coverage requirements to meet in 2025 and we have our newly signed MLA with AT&T. We believe all of these items and others are supportive of multiyear continued development activity. While there will always be ebbs and flows in leasing activity levels based on a variety of factors, we believe that there will remain a need for continuous network investment just as we have seen throughout our history in this business. With regard to our announced master lease agreement with AT&T, we're very excited about this next chapter in our long-standing successful relationship. This new agreement highlights the long-term importance of SBA sites to AT&T's future network deployment plans. The agreement will improve operating efficiencies between our organizations and enhance stability with regard to future leasing growth. We look forward to working closely with AT&T for years to come under this mutually beneficial framework. In the second quarter, our services business remained busy helping our carrier customers meet deployment objectives in an efficient and effective manner. While our services business is down on a year-over-year basis, 2023 will still represent the second biggest service this year in our company's history behind only 2022. We believe our legacy and reputation in the Services business keeps us well positioned to be a go-to provider for our customers to meet their network rollout goals. Internationally, we also had another solid quarter with greater organic leasing activity than we had anticipated. During the quarter, 62% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 38% came through new leases with strong contributions broadly for many of our markets, including Central America, Brazil and South Africa. Brazil, our largest market outside of the U.S. was ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big 3 carriers in that market. I continue to be pleased with our operational performance, cost management and customer relationships in Brazil which has made us a leader in the market. And we have recently seen positive movements in the currency exchange rate, providing some financial benefit and increased U.S. dollars for repatriation as well as contributing to our increased full year outlook. We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil. During the quarter, we again generated solid AFFO providing significant cash for discretionary allocation. While our strong financial position allows us to retain flexibility for future further opportunistic investment in portfolio growth and stock repurchases and we dedicated the majority of our available cash in the quarter to paying down the outstanding balance on our revolver. We immediately benefit from this by reducing our floating rate cash interest obligations which today represent among the highest cost debt in our capital structure. With the continuing high cost and limited availability of private market tower acquisition opportunities, we believe this is currently our best use of discretionary spending. Our quarter ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.6% which I believe to be the lowest in our history, at least as a public company. As always, we will continue to be opportunistic around investments but for the near term, likely direct future cash flows into the repayment of debt as the most accretive short term and certainly a long-term beneficial use of capital. Our balance sheet is in great shape with no debt maturities until October 2024. And since that maturity could easily be refinanced under our revolver, we are comfortable now to remain opportunistic around timing of future financings. We are a preferred issuer in the debt markets we routinely use and retain very good access to capital. We finished the quarter with 95% of our debt fixed and thus, we are only modestly exposed for now to significant interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we continue paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year. We feel very good about our current capital position. We feel fortunate to be in a sound, stable business with tremendous fundamentals and significant long-term opportunity ahead. Our customers continue to have significant network needs and we will be there to support them in meeting those needs. I want to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our shared success. And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we will hear from Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Ric Prentiss: Good afternoon, everybody. Obviously, I have some questions on the AT&T MLA, big news item there. I appreciate, I think, Randy, you said $6 million of the increase lease activity was really driven by AT&T MLA it [ph].
Jeff Stoops: Rick, can you speak up? We're having trouble hearing you right?
Ric Prentiss: Can you hear me better now?
Jeff Stoops: That's much better. Thank you.
Ric Prentiss: You bet. Yes, I'm sorry about that. I had another phone call come in. It's like doing something busy. Yes, I appreciate some of the color on the MLA with AT&T A couple of questions around it. Why now? And any others that you're working on? And then also suggesting that $6 million increase in guidance came from that it looks like we should be thinking maybe of kind of flattish new lease activity over the next couple of quarters. And as we exit '23, is that the way we should be thinking about it.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So on the MLA, first of all, on the numbers, the $6 million increase is basically due to the MLA. Obviously, that was our -- the 72% [ph] is what we reported last time, we increased to 78% and activity was a little bit slower in the second quarter. So we expect that the MLA will kick in right away based on the terms of it and will be a contributor going forward. In terms of the cadence would be fairly flat. I would expect actually that we'll see an uptick in terms of the contribution to the third quarter as a result of the and then you'll see it be a little bit lower into the fourth quarter. And that lower trajectory has nothing to do with the MLA. That's really based on slowing activity from other carriers. If you recall correctly, we had kind of a trajectory expected that was downward leaning throughout the year and I would expect that will continue as it relates to other contributors. In terms of why, Rick, this agreement with AT&T has been in the works for well over a year. And it's a deal that we believe is beneficial to both organizations. We've been working on it for that period of time and trying to signal and be transparent to our openness for this type of agreement knowing that we were likely to enter into this agreement which we have. We really don't want to comment too much on what's going on with other customers. But just as we have always said, we are not hung up so much on structure as we are on finding mutually beneficial agreements with our customers.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. And one other one for me on the -- paying down the revolver. When does the calculus move back towards stock buyback? Because it sounds like there's still not a lot of M&A out there which would be probably your first choice. But how do we think about when the lever moves since you're down to 6.6 leverage to more stock buyback? Is that like a next year item? Is that further out?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I think if rates stay the same and stock prices stay the same, it's -- it will continue to be more accretive. And obviously, good for the overall capital position to continue to pay down the revolver to 0. So when we get to that point, Rick, we should you could ask that question again.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins: Just curious, just a follow-up on the comprehensive deal with AT&T. Can you share some of the multiyear components of this deal, is there going to be a straight-line element that sometimes comes up with these types of multiyear or comprehensive opportunities? And does it change the way investors should think about leasing overall for SBA in 2024 in the domestic side?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Mike. So it will certainly smooth the way that we operate with AT&T. So I think from that perspective, perhaps it impacts our reported growth numbers in terms of ebbs and flows. There may be a little bit less of that, at least as it relates to this particular agreement. From a straight-line impact, we would expect that over the course of the agreement that we will have some straight-line impacts but there are no straight line -- or very minimal straight-line impacts in the short term.
Michael Rollins: And just on the commentary on leasing. So the site development revenues are unchanged from the prior guidance. But you did note that there was some slower activity levels. Was this just something that you were maybe more prepared for earlier in the year? Or is there anything different about your development business that maybe gave your expectation a little more durability in spite of some of the changes that you observed?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I think we know our site development business very well. You know it primarily centers around work almost entirely work on our towers. So we have a very good feel for it. And there's just enough work out there Mike, that was already booked earlier in the year and actually some of it probably spilling over from last year, that's now working itself through our services backlog that gives us the comfort to continue with the guidance that we have. So a lot of it is more a reflection of activity levels that occurred Q1, Q4 of last year.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery: Great. I was just wondering on the leverage point, have you had any more consideration of targeting investment-grade status? Or is that -- is this going to be just a temporary that change in your overall leverage targets. And then you could just talk on [ph].
Jeff Stoops: Yes. Right now, I think you should assume it's temporary so that we can continue to watch interest rates and see where they go. If interest rates stay high, it may not be temporary. We haven't made that decision yet. Actually, we're paying down the revolver because it's the most economic and best use of our cash today. It just so happens that as we continue to do that, we further decrease leverage which makes the path of going to investment grade. If we were to so choose that path easier to obtain. But I really don't think you should look at it, Simon, as a conscious effort to get to investment grade as much as it is just the best financial use of our discretionary cash.
Simon Flannery: Great. Yes. And just one follow-up. You mentioned earlier that you still got a lot of sites that have not been upgraded to 5G. Do you think as given some of the rural SKU of your portfolio, do you think that would advantage to your portfolio in the next several years versus to that initial build out?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I think if history is any guide, I guess, that's exactly how it works. It starts out in the NFL cities, it goes from there.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.
Phil Cusick: Two, if I can. How should we think about the exit run rate in activity this year versus going into next year? AT&T, it sounds like is steady in 3Q and 4Q and then from there and others are decelerating through this year. Should we think of the fourth quarter as a decent run rate for next year or maybe a little bit lower than that? And then second, Jeff, I didn't understand your comment just a second ago on the service revenue now for activity earlier in the year. And it sounds like services are still running well ahead of historical levels. Do you expect them to come in -- it sounds like you expect them -- you're going to make the guide this year but next year, it sounds like things are going to be probably well below. Does that make sense?
Jeff Stoops: Go ahead, Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So on the first question, we do -- we expect that the fourth quarter run rate, you're talking specifically, just to be clear about domestic organic leasing contribution to be around approximately $17 million to $17.5 million. But I would definitely caution you as to using that as an indicator of next year. As I mentioned earlier, the trajectory based on activity levels is declining. And as a result, we would expect those numbers to step down as we move into next year. We're obviously not ready to give 2024 guidance yet at this point. but just kind of broadly when you think about it, the way we've always explained it and just the way that it actually happens is that you get a lot of growth, for instance, the 2023 growth is based heavily on the leasing activity that took place at the end of last year, 2022. And next year's numbers will be based heavily on the leasing activity that's taking place this year. So the number is a little bit higher than we said before because of the impacts of the MLA for the fourth quarter but I don't believe we'll be indicative of the numbers for next year.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And as far as the services revenue, Phil, the first half of what we report in 2024 will be largely dictated by what we do now operationally with leasing. We have 2 different components of that. We have the site acquisition component which is the planning stuff and then we have the construction which is where a lot of the current activity is taking place because that's the last part of the cycle. So we'll see. We'll see where we come out with the guidance on services but it will be obviously heavily impacted by how we finish out the rest of the year.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
Jonathan Atkin: So I was interested in doing just to contextualize the AT&T MLA, how much of your revenues for kind of this year next year, the following year, can we be considered to be fairly locked in as opposed to usage based -- segmental revenue.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, you mean just the percentage of the AT&T revenue or overall revenue?
Jonathan Atkin: Overall revenue base for the whole company, how do we kind of think about how much is kind of a lock versus more the.
Brendan Cavanagh: Right. John, we can't give specific numbers out. And obviously, a number of our agreements with other customers are fluid and where those amounts end up or obviously unknown. So as a percentage, it's hard to say as well. So we can't be very specific about it but we do have some portion of our revenue base that is locked in now under this agreement that wasn't before.
Jeff Stoops: And a greater portion of the AT&T then probably exists under other agreements, although we still have some of that. And I mean I don't think that's not a number that we have focused on that. So the best we can answer, Jonathan, is that it's a much greater extent under the AT&T revenue.
Jonathan Atkin: Then and you're comparing that to your agreements with other carriers as opposed to other towercos agreements with AT&T, I'm assuming?
Jeff Stoops: Correct. Yes. correct.
Jonathan Atkin: Got it. Yes, understood. And then maybe just give us some directional guidance around the trajectory around building new towers and ground lease and Eastman's activity.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I mean we continue to look for good financially smart new build opportunities. We're doing those mostly outside the United States primarily Brazil and South Africa, our 2 largest markets outside the United States. And we have a steady focus on ground lease purchases and extensions which hasn't changed at all. It's moved a little bit more international in terms of the mix just because we've been at it so long in the United States. But nothing's really changed there. We would put more capital into particularly the land purchases and extensions if the opportunities arose.
Jonathan Atkin: And then in terms of purchasing other portfolios, maybe you're thinking about Africa and your operating history there and maybe some tuck-in opportunities, either that geography or elsewhere -- what are your thoughts on increasing your scale in existing markets versus expanding the footprint?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I mean, the answer to that question is pretty much the same as it has been for years for the right deal, we will do it. We have no strategic hole that we feel needs to be filled. In market growth because of the existing base is going to be preferred over new market growth but we would still go into a new market. If we found the right deal and I would point back to the Tanzania investment as a good example of that. But because it's all financially driven, it makes our decision to use discretionary cash to pay down the revolver that much more straightforward.
Jonathan Atkin: Lastly, I might have missed this but the duration of the AT&T MLA?
Brendan Cavanagh: It's 5 years, Jonathan.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from David Barden with Bank of America.
David Barden: So I guess maybe 2. The first one, Jeff, just with respect to some of the actions that your competitors are taking frozen cons for being in the construction business for towers at all? Is there maybe an opportunity to redirect resources in more optimal ways? Or is there an opportunity if people are willing to give up business for you guys to lean in at the margin as we think about the go ahead business? And then second, maybe for Mark, as we think about the 25 term loan and its maturity what should the Street be doing in terms of expectations in the model with respect to how we address that cost fixed, long-term roll it? What is the plan?
Jeff Stoops: Dave, I'm going to defer that to our expert here, Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the services question, David, we've had a lot of history. Actually, you recall, that's how SBA started. So we have a very flexible cost structure that allows us to ramp up, ramp down we use a lot of subcontracted tower crews. We have our own but we also use subcontracted tower crews. And 1 of the things that has really served us well and our customers give us high praise for this is by using our services people for work on our towers for them, they are greatly benefited in terms of speed to market and efficiencies. So I don't think that changes. So I guess if I had to choose 1 of your 2 options lean out or lean in, we'll look to lean in and not be afraid to do that because of our confidence in how we manage that business.
Mark DeRussy: And Dave, on the term loan, your question of modeling, if I can only say into the future enough but we, yes. I mean, the best thing, I think, for people to do when looking at it is probably to assume a similar like-for-like refinancing. And I would expect that spreads will be similar to up slightly from where they are today but we'll have to see how that plays out. And then it's just a matter of using the forward curve in terms of the benchmark, SOFA rate. But that doesn't mean that that's necessarily how it will play out. We will probably have -- we will be evaluating multiple different options. There may be a mix of different instruments that we use. Some may be fixed and some may be floating but all things are on the table for us right now and we look at that, frankly, every day. But if you're just simply modeling out long term, I think the best thing to do is to assume a like-for-like instrument.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with LightShed.
Walter Piecyk: All right. Perfect. Sorry. The -- if you didn't have the AT&T MLA, would the 72 still stick? Or would that fall off accelerating faster than you thought in terms of the second half of the year?
Brendan Cavanagh: I can't really answer that question, Walt, because there's so many elements that go into it. what would the activity be with AT&T, otherwise, those types of things. So I can't really say for sure what it would be, given that we were working on this for quite a while. [Technical Difficulty] First, we don't like to discuss the individual customers but obviously, DISH has just gotten through a major deadline that they had. There's a little bit of a slowdown or pause, if you will, related to that. And we would expect that will eventually pick up. But given the delay between signings and revenue recognition, I would expect that will weigh year-over-year on next year. and T-Mobile was frankly very, very busy as well and you have somewhat of a similar dynamic there. But that's what we're going into for next year. But longer term, there's still a lot to do there. So we can...
Walter Piecyk: So if there was something incremental like qualitatively? What do you think those issues are?
Brendan Cavanagh: If there was something incremental in what sense?
Walter Piecyk: You just -- in the response you just gave, meaning in Q2 was a little bit less and you're saying you're expecting that to continue into the third and fourth quarter because, again, I think you guys did a good job historically already talking about a slowdown in the second half of the year? And also maybe how that would carry into 2024. And I'm just trying to get a sense of is there something new or worse?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I don't think there's something particularly new. I think it's been a little bit slower than what we had anticipated before. But directionally, it's still the same. So what does that mean for next year? Does that mean $5 million difference or $10 million. I can't tell you yet. We're not ready to get there and we still have half the year to go. But it's marginally worse than what we thought in terms of the balance of the other carriers.
Jeff Stoops: The qualitative benefits or the positives to look forward to all I mean, DISH has to get started, whether it's late Q4 or early Q1 on their 2025 bill which is going to be large. T-Mobile hasn't even got the C-band and the 3.5 spectrum yet. You got the -- you got some folks waiting on availability of dual band equipment. So there's all kinds of things to look forward to as we move through the year and into next.
Walter Piecyk: Are you seeing anything from cable, Jeff?
Jeff Stoops: Little bit but not enough to give anyone the impression it's going to move the needle.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Batya Levi with UBS.
Batya Levi: Great. A quick follow-up on the AT&T lay. Does it cover all the towers that AT&T has equipment on your sites? And should we assume that the escalator in there is similar to the 3%, 3.5% that you have? And another one, I believe you said 42-58 mix for amendments and new leases. Can you give us a sense of how that will look like if we just exclude DISH?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So I'm sorry, what was the first part of the question?
Batya Levi: AT&T MLA, if it includes all the sites they have with you and the escalator.
Brendan Cavanagh: Right. So it does -- there may be a few exceptions because of specific issues around individual sites but the vast majority of our sites are covered by the MLA.
Jeff Stoops: That have AT&T on.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, that have AT&T on of course. And then on the escalator piece, I can't really get into the specifics around what the escalator is but our historical escalator with AT&T has been north of 3% and we would expect that to continue.
Batya Levi: Great. And the amendments without DASH, is that much higher than the 42%?
Brendan Cavanagh: It would be. It would be if you took DISH out of the mix, you would have a much higher percentage of amendments of the total.
Batya Levi: Okay. Maybe just a quick one. As you -- can you give us a sense on what the guidance assumes for DISH as we exit the year?
Brendan Cavanagh: No, we can't give you that kind of specificity now. Much less it was but it's much less than it was exiting last year.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.
Nick Del Deo: First, regarding the AT&T deal, should we think of that as pulling forward some revenue that you otherwise would have expected in the latter years into the near future? And do you feel that the totality of the revenue that you'll get from AT&T over the course of the contract is similar to what it otherwise would have been.
Jeff Stoops: The answer to the last part of your question is yes. The answer to the first part, I don't think it's a pull forward.
Brendan Cavanagh: I mean it's hard to say because, obviously, previously, it would be very specific to the timing of when they were signing things. We don't know exactly what that timing would be. So could be pulling forward, could be pushing.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. The answer to your question will be only known in hindsight by the levels of AT&T's activity.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. So we should think of it more, call it, smoothing a bit but not necessarily sort of a mass reallocation of what the revenue would have been. Is that fair?
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
Nick Del Deo: Yes. Okay, great. And then, kind of two clarifications for Brendan. One, it looks like your forecast for other international revenue went up by about $9 million versus last quarter's guidance. What was that? And was it in this quarter's results? And then second, can you elaborate a bit on the $7 million in cost reclassifications that you noted in your prepared remarks -- what was it reclassified to and from? What was behind it which segment?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the other international was -- roughly half of that was in the second quarter. There is some that is in the balance of the year. And it's frankly a mix of things. It's not 1 thing in particular. There was some increased cash basis revenue recovery that we did not necessarily forecast and some that we've actually even seen subsequent to quarter end. And then also some termination fees. And just other frankly, cats and dogs, Nick but they did add up and we actually have higher expectations for the balance of the year. So that's that piece of it. On the accounting reclassification it basically has to do with the decommissioning of some carrier-related equipment, basically Sprint oriented equipment at some of our tower sites that we previously had expected or had been recording as a cost of revenue, a direct cost of revenue. But after discussion with our accountants, it was determined that the best classification for that was impairment and decommissioning costs. So basically, it's just a move of those costs out of cost of revenue and into impairment and decommission costs.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. So sort of a onetime true-up?
Brendan Cavanagh: There was some onetime true-up in there but that's the way to also be going forward and that's assumed within the guidance that we've given around tower cash flow.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Can you share anything about how much of the change was attributable to that beyond the $7 million recognized in the quarter, what it would be for the full year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. It's another roughly $4 million.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.
Brett Feldman: Two questions, if you don't mind. When some of your peers announced their own versions of MLAs or holistic agreements or whatever they call it, it's not uncommon when they announce it for them, they come out and say, "Oh, by the way, we're raising our guidance for straight-line revenue. I know you got a question about this earlier but it's typically because there's some incremental commitment that was made in that agreement, maybe use escalators or some other amount of leasing. And you didn't do that with this agreement. So I can imagine a question we're going to get is, ultimately, what do you feel like you accomplished through the MLA because you've been very selective and entering into these larger agreements? And I know there's been some questions on it but I'm trying to think about the right way of framing that. And then the second question is portfolio growth has been a focus for SBA for a very long time. I remember the analyst meeting, I don't know, 15-plus years ago when you first started talking about those long-term targets. And it's understandable why paying down your revolver right now is probably the economically most accretive thing to do. But whenever we get past this moment, do you think portfolio growth is going to be the same priority and same opportunity? Or are you starting to suspect that maybe the tower portfolios that you don't own in the markets you're in or might want to be and are not nearly as attractive as the types of portfolios you could just develop on your own, particularly outside the U.S.
Jeff Stoops: I will take the last one first. I believe portfolio growth will always be our most desirable and highest potential allocation of capital. where it falls today. I mean, keep in mind, we grew the portfolio 15% last year. Where it falls today is purely a function of cost of debt and availability and pricing of assets. But as long as all that works out, Brett, to achieve an investment result that we want, I don't see the preference and prioritization of portfolio growth changing.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. And Brett, on the question around the straight line for the MLA, there actually was you couldn't see it but there is actually some small impact to straight line that was actually offset by a decrease in straight line associated with some of the accelerated Sprint churn that we mentioned earlier. So there is a small impact. But in terms of what it looks like going forward, obviously, what our peers have done and what we've done, they're probably not exactly the same agreements. I'm sure there are terms that are different. I can't speak to there specifically. But really, it's a function of timing in terms of when certain commitments take place. And in the future, I would expect that there will be some straight-line impact as a result of this deal but it's a little more activity driven than it is upfront.
Jeff Stoops: It will -- you will see straight-line benefits over time over the course of the 5 years, Brett, based on various triggers and activity levels as opposed to as opposed to upon signing.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Jonathan Chaplin [ph] with New Street.
Unidentified Analyst: One just very basic question. How do you assess that paying down the revolver is the most accretive use of free cash flow? How do you sort of put that up against the accretion you get from share repurchase? Is it as simple as what the yield of the debt is relative to your AFFO yield? And are you taking the direction of rates into consideration when you make that determination? Or is it just sort of a moment-by-moment decision that drives whether you're in the market buying back stock or paying down the revolver? And then just a follow-up question on DISH. Is there anything assumed in new leasing activity for the second half of this year from DISH in your guidance?
Brendan Cavanagh: The accretion analysis takes into account a number of things. There's certainly the basic straightforward piece that you mentioned which is what's the yield of buying back our stock today versus what can we save by paying down the revolver or any debt. And right now, that actually is more accretive to pay down the revolver today. But we also look at it long term and we look at our expectations for growth. for growth and cash flow as well as what we think our future financing or refinancing costs will be and that positioning relative to our balance sheet as a whole is also relevant to it.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And that bodes towards stock repurchases, Jonathan, with one major exception today which is we don't know that interest rates have stopped going up. And when interest rates go up, it immediately affects the cost on the revolver. We can always buy our stock back. And that -- we take comfort in that. But when you have an increasing interest rate environment where we don't know when it's over, we just think both from a business perspective and certainly a balance sheet perspective and from an accretion perspective, pay down the revolver balance while we have one as the way to go.
Brendan Cavanagh: And DISH in terms of the impact for the second half of the year, as we mentioned, it's obviously been slower in terms of new business being signed up with them. There's still a significant contributor to the second half numbers because of all the business that they did with us over the last year. But we expect that we'll continue to see, at least for this year, less executions with them. But ultimately, they have a ton to do, as we talked about to meet their 25% goal and we would expect that, that will turn around sometime at the end of the year or into next year.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: Just going back to the question on investment grade. I know that's clearly not part of the plan right now. But theoretically, if you did make that decision, what type of leverage do you think you'd have to target to get there? And how quickly do you think you could get there based on where your leverage is at today?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, based on the thresholds that are there by the agencies or at least by one of the agencies right now, we're getting very close to being there, certainly within a half turn of leverage of being there. but it would be more about the commitment to staying there than it would be about hitting the leverage tier.
Eric Luebchow: Yes. Understood. And then just another question on the comprehensive MLA. I mean does this it all indicates that you guys would still be open to entering into simpler arrangements with some of the other carriers to maybe smooth out some of the leasing volatility? Or is it really just a case-by-case basis what you think would be NPV positive for your business?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I mean it's really the latter. But I mean, we've always said we would be open to a variety of structures I mean this, I think, evidence is that openness. So for the right deal, Eric, we would do any number of structures with our customers.
Operator: And next will hear from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.
Brendan Lynch: Belaboring the point, I have a few on the maybe just high level, given the MLA with Tim and now with AT&T, has the market changed? Have customers changed? Or has your perspective changed? And then maybe if you could give us any specifics along the number of sites, minimum payment schedule. You mentioned it was sort of 5 years but I'd imagine the leases are for much longer. Any details around that would be helpful.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think in terms of the details, we need to keep -- stay away from most of those. There's a lot of specific things that you asked about there that obviously are somewhat important for us to keep confidential for both us and our customers. But it is a 5-year agreement and there will be a lot of ramifications that I would expect would extend beyond the 5 years. In terms of the M&A in general, I think Jeff kind of answered this earlier. It's -- we've always been open to different structures, obviously, at different points in time in our history. We haven't necessarily found terms that we found to be beneficial to us or they didn't work for our customers, whatever the case may be. So we've done less of those. But we've done MLAs over the years in various structures, we have in MLA today with Verizon, we've had MLAs with T-Mobile and with DISH. So we've done these agreements before but each 1 is dependent upon the specifics around that carrier and their needs at the time and what works for both parties. So I don't know that anything has holistically changed out in the market broadly.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I mean, we are trying to be responsive to our customers, while at the same time being responsible to ourselves and our shareholders. and that will continue to be kind of the big picture as to how we approach these things and it could lead to more or if this could be the only one.
Brendan Lynch: Maybe just to clarify a point. I think you've described some of your past MLAs as being pricing menus. Is that how you would characterize this arrangement with AT&T or is there a better way to think about it?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. This would be a little different than that. This would be payments in exchange for AT&T having certain rights to use our towers.
Operator: And now we'll hear from Greg Williams with TD Cowen.
Greg Williams: Just first question on any further developments with beyond Tim with the other carriers, any ongoing discussions are you having them? And are you hopeful you can get anything done by year-end? And then just second, on the site development, it sounds like it'll hang out in the low 50s for the next few quarters. Anything to think about in terms of service margins from here?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. On the oil question, you're talking specifically about deals with the other carriers that took over iWireless I believe yes, we are having conversations with those other carriers. And it's possible that there would be some other arrangements truck with them but it's premature for us to say. And obviously, if we do reach one, we'll let you know at that time. And then on the site development question, I would expect that the margins will stay pretty similar on a percentage basis to what you've seen during the first half of this year. The volume may be a hair lower but pretty flat. Your estimate of around 50 or so quarters is probably about right.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time.
Jeff Stoops: Great. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening and we look forward to getting back together in late October for our third quarter report. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-01 11:10:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA, First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA’s first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today’s press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, May 1 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make.  In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan to discuss our first quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We started the year off with a solid first quarter. Our results were slightly ahead of our expectation and allowed us to increase our full-year 2023 outlook for most metrics.  Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $617.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $610.4 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $2.5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2022.  Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the first quarter of 2022, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.9%.  Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis, including 3.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter remains steady and was similar through the fourth quarter.  We again saw balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 51% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 49%. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenues signed up during the quarter. Domestically, churn was in-line with our prior quarter projections, and our full-year churn expectations remain the same as we provided last quarter, including $25 million to $30 million of Sprint merger-related churn.  Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 2.5% net, including 7.8% of churn or 10.3% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was good again, with similar results to our solid fourth quarter. Inflation-based escalators also continue to make healthy contributions to our organic growth, although these inflationary rates have begun to decline from their ‘22 highs. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another good quarter, although the impact of the previously discussed TIM agreement weighed on our first quarter, same-tower organic growth. This growth rate in Brazil was 4.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.9% of churn.  International churn remains elevated, but in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook. Excluding Oi consolidation related churn, we believe 2023 will be the high watermark for international churn.  As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation, other than associated with the TIM agreement, but if during the year we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time.  During the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 12.4% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $491 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well, with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.3% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.9% or 91.8%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $459.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. During the first quarter, our services business had another strong quarter, with $58.2 million in revenue and $14.1 million of segment operating profit. Our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G related equipment during the quarter, and our services backlogs also remained healthy at quarter end. Adjusted Funds From Operations or AFFO in the first quarter was $341.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.13, an increase of 5.7% over the first quarter of 2022. AFFO growth was hindered by increased interest rates, which are anticipated to impact growth rates throughout the year. During the first quarter, we continue to invest in our portfolio, acquiring 14 communication sites for total cash consideration of $8.6 million. During the quarter we also built 52 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 66 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $63.7 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. With that, I’ll now turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our balance sheet. 
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter of $12.9 billion total debt and $12.7 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x, below the low end of our target range. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remains at a strong 4.7x. During and subsequent to quarter end, we borrowed and repaid certain amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have a $595 million outstanding balance under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.8 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.5%.  The interest rate on 93% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the quarter we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock and we currently have $505 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at March 31, 2023 were $108.3 million. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $93.9 million or $0.85 per share. And today we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.85 per share, payable on June 21, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 26, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the year ago period and only represents 27% of our projected full year AFFO.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. The first quarter represented a very good start to 2023. Our team continued to execute at a very high level and we produced solid year-over-year growth in each of our key metrics. Each of our largest U.S. customers remain busy and they contributed relatively equally to our organic leasing activity during the quarter. The focus of their activity was a balanced mix of adding equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands and infill and coverage expansion through brand new colocations.  While we believe domestic activity in 2023 will fall below the peak levels of activity in 2022, we expect our carrier customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment over the next several years for a number of reasons.  Some of AT&T's and Verizon’s C-Band licenses will not be cleared until later this year. The C-Band and 3.45 gigahertz licenses won by T-Mobile have been delayed due to the lapse of the FCC spectrum authority. Dual band radios are our customers are planning to use in their deployment supporting 3.45 gigahertz and C-Band frequencies have just been approved by the FCC and dual band radios supporting C-Band and CBRS are still pending approval. And DISH will be moving forward with additional co-locations to meet their 2025 coverage requirements. We believe all of these developments will drive multi-year continued development activity.  Also encouraging about the prospects for future network development activity is the letter sent last week from CTIA to the White House, imploring the President to free up 1,500 megahertz of additional mid-band spectrum currently held by the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. The request is for the spectrum to be made available on a full-power license basis, which obviously would have positive implications for additional macro-site activity. The request from CTIA demonstrates the industry believes that more network resources will be necessary to handle increasing demand for volume, quality and new applications and to stay competitive with the rest of the world.  Just as the last 20 years has demonstrated the need for continuous network investment, we believe the future will be the same. We believe this will provide continued – a continued positive environment for SBA.  Internationally we also add a solid quarter with continued steady organic leasing activity. During the first quarter, 42% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 58% came through new leases with particularly strong contributions from Tanzania and South Africa. Brazil also had a strong quarter, ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big three carriers in that market, as well as good-sized contributions from CPI based escalators.  The integration of the GTS assets has gone very smoothly and these assets are performing well thus far, and we have seen a stabilization in the currency exchange rate that has contributed to our increased full-year outlook. We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil over the coming years as we build on our strong customer relationships and expect meaningful 5G related investments and continued expansion of wireless services throughout the country.  Moving on now to our balance sheet, we remain in a very strong position. As we have stated before, we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we currently participate in with extremely good access to capital. With respect to the current interest rate environment, fortunately we do not have any debt materials until October 2024. Thus we do not need to issue incremental debt today, unless we see a compelling use of capital that we expect to be additive to long-term shareholder value.  We finished the quarter with 93% of our debt fixed and thus we are only modestly exposed to significant interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we anticipate further paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year absent other more compelling capital allocation.  While our first choice for capital allocation continues to be portfolio growth, today the market is pretty slow globally and lacking attractive opportunities. That of course can change quickly and we will be ready when it does. We ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x below our target range and giving us flexibility if we see value enhancing investment opportunities. As a result of our strong financial position and our optimism about our future, today we announced our second quarter dividend, consistently our first quarter dividend which represents a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. This dividend represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFFO in our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stocking purchases and revolver payments. Our financial condition remains very strong. Last quarter I mentioned the fourth quarter ratings upgrade we received from Standard & Poor’s to just below investment grade. Since our last earnings release, we received another ratings increase, this time from Moody's. These upgrades are indicative of the comfort the rating agencies have and the strength and stability of our underlying business. The future of our business remains bright. Our customers continue to have significant network needs and we are committed to supporting them and efficiently and effectively meeting those needs. I want to thank our customers and I want to thank our team members for the significant effort put in by all to the contribution to our shared success. We look forward to sharing with you our progress as we move throughout the balance of 2023.  And with that Eric, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And first we will hear from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hi! Thanks for taking my question, guys. It looks like you did about $20 million or $21 million in leasing in the first quarter. The guidance implies may be 51 or so for the rest of the year. Should we think of the acceleration from here being fairly linear or is it going to have a bit of a different shape to it?
Jeff Stoops: It should be fairly linear Nick. The $21 million that you mentioned is about right for the first quarter and I would expect it to be kind of a gradual step down throughout the year. 
Nick Del Deo: Okay, okay, good. And then with the strike to new builds overseas, looks like the pace stepped down quite a bit versus what you were doing in 2022. So I just want to know if that's kind of normal noise or if there's something more substantive that we should be cognizant of. 
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I think it's just a little bit of a slow gig out of the gate for the year. I don't think it's any more than that and we're not making any material adjustments to what we think we're about to do this year.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Which countries are you most focused on from a new build perspective? 
Jeff Stoops: It really attracts our largest markets. So I would say outside the U.S., it would be Brazil, South Africa, Tanzania, but we will build towers I believe in every country in which we're currently operating for this year. 
Brendan Cavanagh: One thing Nick is that in Brazil a little bit of that slowdown is with the merger that took place among the carriers. There's some focus on that. So, that's put a little bit of a slowdown on the new builds temporarily, but we expect over time that will obviously come back and pick up.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, great. Well, thank you both. 
Operator: And next we'll hear from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. So given the comment that you made Jeff about – I think it was Jeff, you made a comment about lack of – relative lack of compelling portfolio growth opportunities. I wondered why stock buybacks didn't kind of rank higher on the packing order in terms of capital allocation. And then secondly, as you think about U.S. leasing specifically, just wondering if you can maybe give us some of the puts and takes around any carriers that you might see even ramping on your portfolio, the activity level and then those that might be kind of tapering and what kind of rate of change do you expect. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, in terms of the stock repurchases, John, they are definitely high on our priority list as we demonstrated over the years and they will continue to be. We just feel like at this moment in time that we need to let the Fed do their thing and get to the point where we see that interest rates have stopped going up, because the rate that they are increasing has a direct impact on the cost of our revolving credit facility.  So we think through this particular period of time, and given the rate that we're paying on the revolver, that is absolutely the best use of our temporary capital allocations, but rest assured we will be buying material amounts of stock back over the coming years. In terms of the rate of changes of the carriers, and we don't want to get into too much detail about who's exactly doing what, and I think it's been fairly well broadcast that who was spending the most money last year, and who was the most active. T-Mobile and DISH really were the two big ones last year for the industry. Verizon and AT&T were busy. And that really hasn't changed a whole lot this year other than the aggregate amounts when you add it all up, what we expect for this year in terms of the volume of activity is going to be a little bit off from last year. 
Jonathan Atkin : Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with LightShed. 
Walter Piecyk: Thanks. I guess a follow-up, and sorry for not knowing this, but what is the size of that loan, meaning that how much more you need to pay down, obviously given the rate environment understood. What would you allocate there?
Jeff Stoops: So, the revolver is $595.0 million Wal and absent some other use of capital allocations, that'll be paid off by the end of this year.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. So, I mean, the rates have been so volatile obviously, but there's – can we assume there's just no reason to keep any of it, meaning that like we should just assume zero share repurchase until that's done. And then when it's done, you kind of unleash on the share repurchase or is there other elements in your cap structure that I'm not remembering that would impact the timing of when the share repurchase would kick back in. 
Jeff Stoops: I think your intuition is, is directly correct. I mean, right now we're using dollars to pay back 6.5% debt. When that’s paid down, we won’t be earning 6.8% on our cash. So we'll be looking for other uses.
Walter Piecyk: And then similar I guess question on the dividend, not that I'm ever complaining about steady dividend growth, because obviously that helps to broaden the investor base, but I guess I have to ask the question. Why increase the dividend to that amount, if at all, if it makes more sense to maybe get rid of that element of your debt?
Jeff Stoops: You know we're very confident of the debt, unless we spend additional money on something that will be obviously better, will be gone this year. So we didn't want to get off of a long-term dividend trend that we're trying to establish here just for the sake of less than a year.
Walter Piecyk: Understood, and just one last question. I think the cable companies have been, this is my opinion, I don't know, I'm not stating this as facts, but maybe have been delayed in building infrastructure, maybe because of some vendor issues associated with some of the spectrum that they have. And I'm just curious, and it seems like that may be coming or that might be loosening up going forward. I'm just curious if you can kind of characterize any of relationships with, however you wanted to describe them. Basically I'm asking about the cable companies, in terms of as their subscribers and usage ramp, do you see an appetite for starting to add more assets on your towers? 
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I think they will for sure, but they rely very heavily on outsourcing to Verizon's network, at least Charter and Comcast. So with that in mind, it’s kind of their built-in default system. What they have to do around their other spectrum that they can develop is more limited. We are getting some business from them, but of course it pales in comparison to the four traditional wireless service providers. 
Walter Piecyk: Yes, thank you. 
Operator: And next, we'll hear from David Arden with Bank of America. 
David Arden : Hey guys, thanks so much. I guess two questions if I could. I guess maybe Brendan this is for you. We're all kind of looking at DISH exposure and we're just basing the commentary and others. It feels like we're going to get to the mid-June build out requirements. Not clear how much beyond that we're going to go at DISH.  So I guess two questions would be, number one, if we take the 15,000 cell sites that they said that they were going to need to build this first stage of getting their licenses all locked down, and we multiply that by your percentage of domestic towers, and we assume that you've gotten roughly that percentage. It would seem like that would be roughly a $40 million or so number. Is your kind of run rate annualized exposure to Dish if you could kind of validate that or tell me where I'm wrong, that’ll be helpful.  And then, second, with respect to kind of the second half of the year, given kind of where DISH’s finance stand. What have you assumed in the guidance exit rate heading in the 2024? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh : Yeah David, first on your estimate of approximately how much they represent on a run rate, that's in the right ballpark today. We still continue to have activity though with them. They are still signing up new business, not the same pace they were a year ago. And so, we'll exit the year at something, obviously, greater than that, would be our expectation given the fact that we're constantly signing up new business. And then really, it's a question of, as they turn their sights towards their 2025 obligations how much more will be required. And we're pretty confident based on our conversations with them that there will be a good bit more required, so we'll have to see. But I think for the balance of this year, a lot of it is focused on deployment of a lot of what they've already signed up. And we'll see how much more they are able to churn to the 2025 objectives by the time we get to the end of the year. 
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I would just add that I think that's unknown at this point as to how much of the 2025 obligations will actually be booked or signed up in 2023. 
David Arden : Right, I think yeah, that's a good point. And if I could follow-up real quick, maybe Jeff, just on your comments regarding Brazil or maybe this is also Brendan. You mentioned that if there is some sort of new agreement that evolves as a function of the Oi situation, that you would change your outlook obviously. Should the market be expecting that that is a likelihood or should the market be expecting that that's unlikely to happen in 2023? Sorry, thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, the market should expect that it is more likely than not, but the market should take comfort in that, it will fall well within our estimated churn for Brazil that we've been putting forth now for quite some time. 
David Arden : Perfect! Alright, great! Thanks Jeff. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Two questions if I could. First, just curious for your current thoughts on sustaining SBA's al-a-carte leasing framework for the domestic business, and if you have any new thoughts on the possibility of someday pivoting to a structure around comprehensive leases and comprehensive MLA's.  And then just secondly, if you can unpack, within this first quarter churn, the amount that specifically came from the Sprint merger decommissioning. Thanks.
A - Jeff Stoops: Yeah, on the al-a-carte versus the – what I think are most commonly called holistic MLA's, you know we're very open to whatever makes the most sense for our customers and for us. We have not – we've done MLA's, we've not done holistic MLA's that provide a customer with kind of all you can need equipment rights up to a specified amount in exchange for some kind of pricing benefit. Although we almost did back in 2013, 2014, we came very close to doing that. So I think you should take all that Michael as kind of our view that it continues our kind of opportunistic way of running the business and we will do what's right for us and our customers at that time. And that you should not assume that you won't ever see that kind of agreement from us in the future.
Brendan Cavanagh: And Mike, on the Sprint churn question in the first quarter, $6.5 million of the churn, incremental churn to Q1 was related to Sprint. 
Michael Rollins : Thanks. 
A - Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Brandon Nispel with Keybanc Capital Market.
Brandon Nispel : Great! Multipart question for you Jeff. Can you talk about booking's activity in terms of unsigned lease applications and how that's trending this quarter from like a year-over-year perspective?  Then you had mentioned a number of drivers in terms of why we should still be bullish on 5G investments, including Verizon, AT&T, CBAN that’s not being cleared, T-Mobile licenses, dual band radios and DISH. Which of these is the largest potential driver for leasing for you over the next couple of years. Thanks. 
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I think the – well, the biggest drivers will be the ones that I believe are most likely. It's got to be the dual band equipment. And obviously we need to get the T-Mobile licenses that they went and paid for, freed up out of the FCC. So those will be drivers that really get – and we know that the CBAN spectrum will be cleared by the end of this year, which just particularly in AT&T's case will coincide with when they'll see good availability of the dual band 3.45 and CBAN radios. So all those things I think are going to be positively impactful you know late ’23, certainly into 20224.  And because I answered your second question first – oh, the backlog. Yeah, the backlog is probably down a little bit from where it was a year ago, but it's been holding steady for the last quarter or two. 
Brandon Nispel : Great, thanks. And one follow-up, when do you expect to see lease applications for some of these dual band radios? Thanks.
A - Jeff Stoops: I would say second half of the year, and then pick it up as you move through the year, the end of the year.
Brandon Nispel : Will they just – I believe it might have even been just last week that the FCC approved by  waiver, the 3.45 and the C-Band dual radio equipment from Ericsson.
Jeff Stoops: Got it, thank you.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Ric Prentiss : Hey everybody! 
A - Jeff Stoops: Hey Ric!
Ric Prentiss : Hey, I wanted to follow-up on Walt’s question about the dividend. You mentioned that the long term churn in the dividend, when do you think dividend payout ratio caps off and does that kind of imply 20% growth is here for a good percent of your future subject to votability [ph]?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I would think it's not going to be a steady 20%. I would think it will – as it has since we started the dividend, it will decline a little bit each year or so over time so we can continue – while still increasing that, what may be the REIT industry's fastest growth dividend, still growing at a very fast clip, while we maintain a relatively low, relative to our peers AFFO payout ratio. That's been the strategy from the start Ric.
Ric Prentiss : Right, right. You guys have been a very good allocator of capital. Is there a capital that's obviously got some international properties that are probably not covered by the REIT exclusion in the U.S. Just wondering, was the cap out like at 70%, 80% or anything?
Brendan Cavanagh: It should be much less than that. I mean maybe way out long term, I would say its closer to 45%, 50%, because ultimately when we're through our NOLs, it will obviously match our net income, or taxable net income. So at this stage the relationship of the tax net income to AFFO is somewhere in that 40% to 50% range.
Ric Prentiss : Okay. And then you mentioned to David's question on the Oi insurance, can you just remind us of what the total Oi insurance or is that still left to be addressed possibly and how that's factored into what your total results are number wise?
A - Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, so related specifically to the Oi consolidation risk, I think you're asking, the total exposure we've ball-parked in the $25 million to $35 million range. We've through the TIM deal, that represents about $10 million of churn that we've locked in, that's in our 2023 guidance. There's nothing in there for anybody else at this point. None of those leases are up. So if it were to be added into this year through an agreement, it would be pulling some of that forward. But the total range we still think is a fair estimate over time of $25 million to $35 million, of which $10 million is already in.
Ric Prentiss : Follow-on for me, on the Sprint churn, a follow-up on Mike's question, $6.5 million is in the first quarter with another $25 million to $30 million Sprint churn is in ‘23. Remind us of what's left out there in kind of the timeframes that you expect coming in maybe in ’24, ’25, ’26, just so you have those carrier consolidations and those kind of make sure that the market's got those similar models. 
A - Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, it's pretty much the same as it's been in the past. Our big years are ‘25 and ‘26, where we would estimate somewhere about $45 million to $50 million in each of those years. Next year as we sit here today, we think we'll be a little bit lower in the $15 million to $20 million range and then as I said, $45 million to $50 million to the following two years, and then there's some marginal amount after that, probably $10 million to $20 million that kind of dribbles out into the future. So that's the full exposure of what's left after this year. 
Ric Prentiss : Great. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Batya Levi with UBS.
Batya Levi: Great, thank you. To the extent that you moved forward with holistic deals, could you talk about if that would change your view on leverage targets? And getting pretty close with investment grade and ‘25 seems to be a year where you have a bunch of issues coming in, can we expect you to put that as a top priority in the near term?  And then, another question on the activity, Verizon suggests that lighting up most C-band spectrum is now going to require new antennas. What's your view of more C-band spectrum coming in? Would you think that that would create more activity? Thank you.
A - Jeff Stoops: On the spectrum that the CTI wrote to the White House about? A brand new spectrum? Yeah, I mean there's some antenna efficiencies that may allow that to happen depending on the spectrum, but there are no radio efficiencies. There has to be new radios that are frequency specific. They could be dual band or multi band, but they are not in any of the equipment today for the spectrum that has not yet been auctioned, so that's a real opportunity should that spectrum become available.  In terms of our leverage, one of the reasons that we – there are several reasons, but one of the reasons that we're using our free cash flow to pay down the revolver is exactly to your point Batya, which is to see how the Fed, how they do in their war against inflation. If they succeed, we believe rates will come down and we will kind of go back exactly to the way we have done business for 20 years.  If it looks like it is more permanent that we're going to be in a higher rate environment and inflation doesn’t come under control, then we'll take a much more serious look at turning investment grade, which will actually position to do fairly well and over a manageable period of time, if that's in fact what we choose to do?  I think the macro world will play itself out in the next year and we will be able to tell you with much more specificity exactly which of those paths we're going to take.
Batya Levi: Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: And next we'll hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. Jeff, you said the M&A market was pretty slow. I wonder if you could just expand on that. Is it that there's just not much available or not much available at attractive prices? And then I was wondering if you could just also, just expand on the infill comment and we've heard a lot of bullish stuff from the telcos on FWA and I was just wondering if you're having more conversations about, if they wanted to add capacity for that, what that might mean for their bill programs over the medium term?
A - Jeff Stoops: Yeah, in terms of M&A, it's a combination of both of those things Simon. There's just not a lot that's being offered for sale or shopped around I mean and that's a global comment relative to past times. I think it's a combination of the interest rate environment and I think it's a combination – and added to that would be the – it's a closing gap, but there's still a gap between buyer and seller expectation. There's really, and we keep pretty close tabs on all opportunities out there and there's really not a lot. And even the fewer that we would find attractive as evidenced by the fact that we did the amounts and everything this quarter.
Simon Flannery: And are you mostly looking in your existing markets or would you be open to new markets?
A - Jeff Stoops: Yeah, we'd be open for the right opportunity similar to our past practices. We would obviously be careful and thoughtful, but we're not foreclosing new markets.
Simon Flannery: Great. And anything on infill you could share on, you know if they do decide to act… [Cross Talk]
Jeff Stoops: Our customers have all been very, and they haven't said anything different to us, have all been very careful to describe fixed wireless as a product that really is just for excess capacity on the 5G network and I don't know if that'll change or not. I mean, they're all – well, the ones that are offering it more intentionally are doing very well. So, I mean you could see at some point that there is specific capital allocation, purely justified off of the fixed wireless. But I cannot tell you today that any activity that we're seeing is predominantly there because of fixed wireless.
Simon Flannery: Right, and perhaps your comments around the CTIA study, that might be a – some of that spectrum might be good for fixed wireless as well. 
Jeff Stoops: Oh yeah, it absolutely would be. But you got to have to deploy it. You got to have to deploy at a minimum radios for that and in most cases probably antennas too.
Simon Flannery: Great! Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.
Phil Cusick: Thanks, guys. So two different subjects if I can. First, there's been a lot of discussion of DISH. Credit markets are concerned what would happen there. Can you remind us where at DISH your contracts lie? And if DISH were to stop building, what your sort of remaining security looks like.  And then second, completely different. South Africa, there's been a lot of power issues and growing power issues. Any changes in how you address this on your tower's interested involvement in supporting the country in power and your carriers? Thank you.
A - Jeff Stoops: I'll take the South Africa question and Brendan, you could take the DISH question if you have the answer. We know it's at the spectrum holding level Phil. I mean, that's probably about as best as we can. We can get back to you with the exact legal entity if you'd like, but it's with the entity that has the spectrum.  So on the South Africa question, you know power is an issue and there is a movement effort by some carriers, particularly – well, I'm not going to name them specifically, but to outsource power on the towers. And it is something that we’re looking at. The bigger issue in South Africa and one that we're working on and hopefully we'll have something meaningful for both us and our customers in the future, is security.  And we really don't want to spend a lot of money on power supply, solving those issues until you have the site facilities secured, and that involves a wide range of potential solutions Phil, which we've got a lot of folks looking at and studying and I think we'll be able to share more with you on that over the coming year. 
Phil Cusick: Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.
Brett Feldman: Thanks. Two questions if you don't mind. For many years now in the U.S., a lot of the new tower that have been constructed have been done by privately funded operators who achieve access to capital or signing leases with their carrier tenants with terms that we just – we're never going to match, and as a result we haven't seen develop a lot of towers in the U.S. for a number of years now.  I'm curious what the market for a new site development in the U.S. looks like. It would seem that with the carriers using higher frequencies than they've ever used before, there'd be some need for identification of the actual infrastructure. But I really don't know, so I’m curious whether that could be an opportunity for you.  And then a separate topic, American tower sold their Mexican fiber business, citing that it really has ended up being a more difficult business than they thought. You've been pretty selective in terms of where you've invested in fiber in your international market. I'm curious how those businesses are performing and whether maybe you're considering any portfolio lending there as well. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Well, other than some assets which are very de minimis to the operation of our data center in Brazil or our towers internationally, we don't have any fiber businesses internationally Brett, so nothing really to divest there.  In terms of new builds, over time they should continue to be a steady, although I don't know if it will be growing number of new build opportunities. The new build market in the U.S. has slowed somewhat as carriers have focused more on amending their existing sites to roll out most efficiently their 5G. And I will also tell you that the cost of new builds have gone up tremendously in the last five years. They may have doubled over that period of time. So I think that's providing a bit of a damper on activities as well. 
Brett Feldman: Are you still seeing those same private operators out there bidding for what’s available or has that cooled down at some degree? 
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, the same names are still out there, but the volumes are well down.
Brett Feldman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.
Brendan Lynch: Great, thanks for taking my question. Jeff, you mentioned the dual-band radios. I was wondering if you give us a little bit more color on that and what you're expecting from the carriers. Have they been holding back in anticipation of this or what do you really expect them to change starting in the second half once you get those applications?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I don't want to speak for our customers, but I will tell you that the literature that's available on this topic from organizations like Light Reading [ph] for example really go into quite a bit of detail as to what our customers plans are with respect to those dual band radios, including one of our customers said to not deploy any of certain amounts of spectrum that they already have until those dual-band radios are. So I mean that's what I know and I don't want to really talk more about specific customer discussions, but I think if you look at that literature, you will see a picture that is very clear that there's, there has been holdback in terms of what our customers would otherwise do, pending the availability of that type of equipment.  And in particular, you know right now the deployment is a separate radio and antenna for C-Band and 3.45. It'll be a more efficient form function when they are combined and to the extent that they were doing that in one truck roll with the two different radios, they would have the efficiencies of a single truck roll. So that's a long-winded way of saying, yeah, we think it's going to be a positive development when that equipment is available. 
Brendan Lynch: Great, thanks, that's helpful. And maybe one balance sheet question for Brendan. Accounts receivable was flat quarter-to-quarter around $183 million, but it's up quite a bit relative to the trailing 12-month average price of that. Is there anything specific that is causing that to occur?
Brendan Cavanagh: Not really, because we are obviously focused on aged accounts receivable, which are not – we're doing fine on collections. So a lot of that's really just timing around some of the services contracts, generally services related in terms of fluctuations not leasing.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color. 
Operator: Next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. 
David Guarino: Thanks. Hey Jeff, I want to talk about that CTIA report you mentioned. What do you think would happen to U.S. macro tower new leasing activity? If the SEC was unsuccessful and they couldn't get access to new build in that spectrum, do you think we'd see growth trail off from the 5% rate, pretty significantly once the C-band spectrum is installed?
Jeff Stoops: Well, I think you'd see a tremendous amount of increased densification, because that will be the only way to satisfy demand in a spectrum constrained environment. The question is, it's the age-old question, who's going to pay for that and are our customer's buying going to find a good enough return on investment? I mean if there’s no more spectrum Dave, there has to be self-splitting and densification.
David Guarino: Okay, and I guess maybe to dive into the densification side, there's ample opportunity within your portfolio for that to happen, right? I wouldn't be fair to say during the 4G build-out the majority that already occurred?
Jeff Stoops: I would say to densify within the existing spectrum and to have no additional spectrum introduced into the system. If you were going to truly build out to the max, to achieve the max 5G capabilities, I would tell you, we have a lot of opportunity and a lot of room on our towers that would need to be filled for our customers to achieve that.
David Guarino: Okay. Maybe stepping outside of the U.S., and it's been, I guess it's been over a year since you guys set up operations in the Philippines. Could you just maybe update us on how many sites you own in the country now, and then another with a lot of M&O tower assets sales? Are there any rumors about on the horizon of maybe the M&O's looking to sell some more assets?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, we've got about 130 or so sites right now, then a bunch more in construction, so we would expect to end the year in the high 100s somewhere.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, and the M&O's have followed up, I mean there are two real M&O's. There's three, but two that really own assets over there, and those customers have continued to hive off chunks of their portfolios, not sure that they've done it too many times, but I know there have been follow-ups I think from each of the two big ones there with additional asset sales.
David Guarino: But nothing else on the horizon that you are aware off? 
Jeff Stoops: Not that we are aware of? 
David Guarino: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: And next we’ll hear from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. 
Eric Luebchow: Great, thanks for taking the question. Just curious, for the two large U.S. carriers that are already deploying C-band today, any kind of rough estimate on how many of your sites has been upgraded just to give us a sense for how long the growth there will be in the next few years?
Jeff Stoops: Below 50%,
Eric Luebchow: Okay, helpful. And I guess when you think about the dual band radios, is there any real difference in your ability to monetize amendments, whether they are separate C-band and 3.45 radios, or if it's a dual-band, is it relatively equivalent in terms of your amendment revenue?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I would say it's roughly equivalent, although the form factor is going to be less from a weight perspective in the dual band unified piece of equipment. 
Eric Luebchow: Got it, makes sense. And just last for me, I know you've made a couple of smaller data-centered investments kind of studying the edge compute market I guess. Have you had any learnings from those or anything to report that maybe could give you some confidence to get bigger in that space over time, either through new development or M&A?
Jeff Stoops: Well, where we've continued to grow is in the edge and the fiber regeneration facilities. We are now up to somewhere between 40 and 50 of those. So what we found Eric is that there is high demand for quality locations where you have power and permitting and fiber. What really has not happened yet to our knowledge anywhere in the globe is the direct tie-in at the edge of the cell site to the wireless networks, which when that comes, that will unleash tremendous amount of demand at the cell site. But we're learning a lot along the way through primarily real estate demand as opposed to demand for this computing to be tied in to the wireless networks.
Eric Luebchow: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: And next we'll hear from Greg Williams with TD Cowen.
Greg Williams: Great, thanks for taking my questions. First one is on services. Your site development came in a bit stronger. Should we expect that also to sort of come down a little bit linearly? And second question is just on the dual-band radio opportunity on network services. So if T-Mobile and AT&T start deploying that, could we see an uptick in our services above and beyond your guidance? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah Greg, we would think that services will be declining slightly into the second half of the year, but I think in a lesser pace. I mean, you can see what our outlook looks like and where the first quarter ended up. It's only slightly ahead of that full year pace. So probably similar in the second quarter and maybe slightly less in the second half of the year, but relatively flat.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. And when the dual-band deployment start Greg, certainly that's going to benefit our services business. 
Greg Williams: Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. 
Jeff Stoops: Great. We want to thank everyone for joining us this evening. We appreciate your participation and we'll talk to you in a quarter. Thank you. 
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-21 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA’s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today’s press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 21 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We finished up an outstanding 2022 with another very strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allowed us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2022 outlook for most metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $609.6 million and cash site leasing revenues were $600.5 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $800,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a benefit of $2.2 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5.1% net over the fourth quarter of 2021, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 9.3%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5% on a net basis, including 3.5% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was not as strong as the third quarter, but still solid. We saw meaningful and balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. Full year organic leasing contributions to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our outlook provided on our prior earnings call. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity and new leases each represented 50% of our domestic bookings. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Domestically, we again experienced less churn than we had projected due to timing of merger-related decommissionings being later than we had previously estimated. We still expect to incur this churn and have incorporated our reduced 2022 domestic churn amount into our outlook for 2023. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.4% net, including 7.6% of churn or 13% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again with similar results to our strong third quarter. 2022 was one of the strongest years in the company’s history for international gross leasing activity or bookings. In addition to strong customer activity levels across many of our markets, we continue to see healthy contribution from inflation-based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another very strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.2% on a constant currency basis. Similar to the third quarter and as anticipated, international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due primarily carrier consolidations and Digicel’s previously announced exit from Panama. During the fourth quarter, 78.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 12.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $485.9 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well with a fourth quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.4% or 90.9%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $460.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.1% in the quarter, again, impacted slightly by outsized services revenue. Excluding the impact of revenues and pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 73.1%. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our services business had another very strong quarter, with $76.5 million in revenue and $19.3 million of segment operating profit. We finished 2022 with our most successful services year in company history as measured by both revenue and profit by a very wide margin. Services backlogs remain very healthy at year end, although off the record high hit earlier in 2022. Our fourth quarter services results were again primarily driven by T-Mobile and Verizon. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the fourth quarter, was $340.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.12, an increase of 11% over the fourth quarter of 2021. AFFO results finished ahead of our prior outlook, but were still negatively impacted relative to our outlook assumptions by our early refinancing of $640 million of secured tower revenue securities in November at a higher interest rate than the retired debt. During the fourth quarter, we meaningfully expanded our portfolio acquiring 2,642 communication sites for total cash consideration of $736.7 million, which included 2,632 sites acquired from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for approximately $725 million. During the quarter, we also built 162 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 31 sites all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $23.2 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the year, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years. The land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now, this afternoon’s earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2023. Our outlook reflects continued year-over-year growth across our leasing business, including an increase in organic leasing revenue contributions from new leases and amendments largely due to the strong new leasing activity we experienced during 2022. We also forecast significant revenue growth contributions from non-organic additions, primarily as a result of having the assets acquired from GTS in Brazil in our results for a full year in 2023. In addition, our leasing revenue outlook contemplates increased impacts from customer churn in 2023. Domestically, the increase is mainly in connection with the anticipated Sprint-related decommissioning, some of which we had previously expected in 2022. Due to the timing shifts of some of these decommissionings, including during the fourth quarter, we are now including an estimate of $25 million to $30 million of Sprint-related churn in our full year outlook. Our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain unchanged. Internationally, our outlook includes increased churn as well, including carryover impacts from Digicel in Panama and carrier consolidations in Central America. In addition, our international churn includes approximately $10 million associated with an agreement we have entered into TIM Brazil, to address their consolidation of a portion of Oi Wireless. This agreement has accelerated certain turn impacts with us in exchange for longer-term business commitments from TIM, and we believe positions us well for a long, mutually beneficial relationship with TIM. Our 2023 outlook does not include any other churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation. But if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to this that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. With regard to our Services business, our full year 2023 outlook reflects the year-over-year decline in revenues and adjusted EBITDA contribution but starts ahead of where our 2022 outlook started. If not for the phenomenal 2022 services results, our outlook for 2023 would represent the best year for services in our company’s history. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to have very healthy services backlog. And as a result, we expect another very strong year for this business. The outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today and also does not assume any share repurchases. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO does not contemplate any further financing activity in 2023, but it does assume we deploy excess cash into repayments of our outstanding revolver balance. Under this assumption, we would end the year with leverage in the mid 6x area, but we project that we would still incur approximately $36 million of increased net cash interest expense compared to 2022. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of $109.6 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We are excited about 2023. Our customers remain active, and we expect to produce very strong results as we help them to achieve their network build-out goals. Before turning the call over to Mark, I would like to take just a moment to discuss the succession plan announced this afternoon. I’m truly honored to have been entrusted with the leadership of this tremendous company. I’ve had the privilege of spending the last 25 years at SBA and spending all of those years working closely with Jeff as the company has grown significantly under his leadership. Jeff has been a great friend and mentor to me and I look forward to continuing to have his counsel as Chairman of the Board. I’m very excited about the future of SBA. We have an amazing business that is part of a great and still growing industry. Our financial strength and very talented leadership team position us well to be a critical support to our customers and to capitalize on many future opportunities. I greatly look forward to working with the rest of the SBA team to continue rewarding shareholders and building upon the company’s great legacy. With that, I’ll turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on the balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $13 billion of total debt and $12.8 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x, which is below the low end of our target range, notwithstanding our significant Brazilian GTS acquisition during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a very strong 4.7x. During the fourth quarter, the company through an existing trust issued $850 million of secured tower revenue securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 11, 2028 and a final maturity date of November 9, 2052. The fixed interest rate on these securities is 6.599%. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the entire $640 million principal amount of our 2018 1C tower securities, which had an anticipated repayment date of March 2023 as well as to pay certain amounts outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Subsequent to quarter end, we continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, we have $585 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest of our total outstanding debt is 3.1% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.0%. The interest rate on 93% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock as we allocated capital to repay amounts outstanding under revolver as a result of the GTS acquisition. We currently have $504 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company’s shares outstanding at December 31, 2022, were 108 million compared to 109 million at December 31, 2021, a reduction of 0.9%. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.7 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.85 per share payable on March 24, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. The fourth quarter was a strong end to one of the best operational years in our history. For the full year 2022, we beat the midpoint of our original full year guidance for revenue by almost 8% for AFFO per share by 5%. We grew our tower portfolio by over 15%, including entering into a new market in Tanzania, which has gone very well. We had a very strong year for lease-up, including one of the best ever internationally. Our Services business had its best year ever, beating the midpoint of our original outlook for services revenue by 46%, and we grew and expanded our relationships with our largest customers worldwide, setting us up for a bright future. During the fourth quarter, our domestic same tower leasing revenue growth was the highest of the year. All of our largest U.S. customers remain busy during the quarter with relatively balanced contributions from each of them as they continued adding equipment to sites in support of the deployment of new spectrum bands. As evidenced by our full year 2023 outlook, we expect the contribution to revenue growth from domestic leases and amendments to be good again this year, and we expect all of our largest customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment during 2023, although perhaps at levels slightly below the peak periods of activity we experienced in 2022. Each of the largest U.S. carriers still have significant remaining network needs. So we are confident we will see solid activity on our domestic power portfolio for years to come. Internationally, we ended the year with another very strong organic leasing quarter. During the fourth quarter, 60% of new business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 40% gain through new leases. International leasing activity was ahead of our internal expectations and led by strong contributions from Brazil, South Africa and Tanzania, our largest markets. In 2022, Brazil had, in particular, a very strong year. Lease-up in Brazil for the year was well ahead of internal expectations, and we also had a larger-than-anticipated contribution from CPI-based escalators. We realized material portfolio growth in Brazil, primarily as a result of the GTS acquisition for which the integration is going very smoothly. The foreign exchange rate fluctuations have stabilized over the last year and were actually a slight tailwind to our 2022 results. As Brendan mentioned, we recently entered into an agreement with 1 of the 3 major carriers in Brazil to address Oi consolidation issues in our broader long-term relationship, and we may do something similar with our other major customers in that market. We believe there are great opportunities for future growth in Brazil, particularly with recent 5G spectrum options as the driver. One item we are watching in Brazil is always recent filing for injunctive relief from some of their debt payments. We currently expect that Oi must and will continue to pay their operational vendors, including rents to tower providers. And to date, we have had no collection issues. Our financial exposure to Oi is much reduced given the recent sale of most of their wireless operations to the other 3 mobile carriers in Brazil, with Oi representing approximately 3.5% of our total international revenue. Our sites are critical to the operation of Oi’s network, and we have very long-term leases. As a result, we will likely see a little impact from this latest filing. However, we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely. Moving on now to our balance sheet, we remain in a very strong position. During the fourth quarter, in order to address the nearing maturity date, we completed a new 5-year ABS offering. And while the interest rate was higher than we would have liked, we were very pleased with the significant level of demand for our offering. We continue to be a preferred issuer with extremely good access to capital. While we have good access to additional debt capital, we will be very thoughtful this year when considering issuing incremental debt in the current rate environment, which would only be done for a compelling use of capital, similar to our Tanzanian GTS acquisitions in 2022. With completion of this refinancing, we now do not have any debt maturities until October of 2024. We finished the year with 93% of our debt fixed, keeping us largely insulated for the time being from significant interest rate fluctuations. Even with the GTS acquisition, we ended the year with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x, below our target range. The strength of our operations and balance sheet and the steady growth in our cash flow allowed us to once again announce an increase of nearly 20% in our quarterly dividend. This increased dividend still represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFFO and our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stock repurchases and revolver payments. The strength of our business and capital structure was recently recognized by the rating agency Standard & Poor’s. Since our third quarter earnings release, S&P increased our corporate rating to BB+, only one notch below investment grade. While a good development, we do not, however, have a specific goal of being an investment-grade company. Should we continue to use AFFO to pay down our revolver and reduce leverage, that would be a tactical choice to generate a guaranteed return to the higher interest rate environment compared to other uses of capital and not a change in our long-term views on the use of leverage. We would be building capacity and biding our time for the next opportunity to issue incremental debt at more attractive rates. We believe the stability and financial strength we offer provides shareholders strong opportunities for additional value creation. I want to end on our succession news. The Board and I have been working on succession planning for several years. We appropriately considered the pros and cons of an external search versus the appointment of an internal candidate as our next CEO. Brendan has, for many years, been growing as the leading internal candidate to be our next CEO with increasing internal and external responsibilities. We are confident we have made the right call. Brendan is an extremely talented executive, equally adept with internal and our external matters, strategy and shareholder value creation. His knowledge of SBA and our industry are without equal. He’s well known and respected in the investment community. SBA has an extremely bright future in his hands, and I get to remain very involved and invested in that as the future Chairman of the Board. So a little bit about my decision. It’s been very difficult, as you can imagine, given my love for involvement with SBA for more than 25 years. But the reasons are very simple. I turned 65 this year. And I’ve reached a point in life where I want to do some things while I still can, but I can’t do while running SBA full time. Things like spending more time with family, a growing number of grandchildren, travel, spending more time at our home in South Carolina and charity work, very basic reasons that I believe we all consider at various times in our life. With these things vying for my time and attention, it became clear that now is the right time to turn over leadership to Brendan and the next generation of our exceptional leaders. As you can see from our fourth quarter results and full year 2023 outlook, I am retiring at a time when SBA’s financial help and prospects are extremely strong. I want to thank all of you on this call or otherwise that have played a role in SBA’s success over the years. We have accomplished a lot, and it certainly has taken the work of many. I consider myself extremely fortunate have had the opportunity to lead such a talented group of individuals as we have at SBA, and to have been able to interact and build relationships with a much larger group of customers, constituents, friends, business partners and others who have all contributed to our success. And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks, Jess. First, Jeff, congrats. Grandbabies are fine. I know you’re going to have fun with them as I am and Brendan, looking forward to working with you in your new role.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Rick.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Rick.
Ric Prentiss: You bet. Two questions, if I could. First, as you think about carrier spending for wireless, obviously, they need to make sure there is revenue and demand out there, what do you all think are the most exciting 5G applications that are coming? And when do customers actually start to get what 5G means? So that’s the first question.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I think that is the seminal question, Rick. And I think, to be honest with you, I can’t name a 5G application that exists today that is kind of in the got to have category. And I think that’s what the whole ecosystem of wireless is waiting on. And when that happens, and I believe it’s a question of when, not if, you’re going to see a heightened sense of needing to invest and make sure that the competition doesn’t get too far ahead. But until that comes along, I think it’s sensible for our customers, particularly ones that have some promises to the Street on free cash flow and things like that, I think, to moderate. And based on all the commentary and what we heard from Ericsson yesterday, I mean that’s what’s going on.
Ric Prentiss: And then more boring question for the second one. How should we think about the site leasing revenue growth pacing into the years in kind of the front-end loaded versus rear-end loaded. And it looked like that have a couple of major revenue items for other, $12 million in the U.S. and $8 million for international. So maybe unpack that a little bit about what those are.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Ric. So the pacing this year, we would expect will be higher growth in the first half of the year with a slight step down in the second half of the year. That obviously is dependent somewhat on how leasing activity goes in terms of signing up new business here in the first half of the year. But the first half is pretty much locked in for the most part based on the success of the leasing activity we saw at the end of last year. I mean your second part you were breaking up just a little bit. I think you were asking about the other on international. Is that...
Ric Prentiss: And U.S., it was like $12 million U.S., $8 million international. What should we think those are?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So it’s a variety of things. In the case of international, there are some increases to pass-through expenses, which is the main driver. And then in the U.S., it’s a mixed bag. There is some other, what we kind of call, cash basis revenue that we’ve assumed will come in the first half. So it’s things like that. That’s really just our estimate of the year-over-year change as opposed to an absolute change as the business gets a little bit bigger, those things tend to grow.
Ric Prentiss: Again, congrats, Jeff, and enjoy the time of the grandbabies.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Ric.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Phil Cusick: Hey, congratulations to both of you, Jeff and Brendan. Well deserved.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Phil.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Phil.
Phil Cusick: I wonder if we could just talk about the sort of pace that you assume of either acceleration or deceleration among your carrier customers this year. It seems like through last year, you were sort of looking for somebody to pick up. And maybe they haven’t yet, while others sort of expectation will be slowing down this year. What kind of visibility do you have today?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, we’ve got decent visibility. As I just mentioned to Ric, generally, we expect things to be declining in terms of the growth rate from the first half of the year into the second half of the year. The mix varies by carriers. We had a couple of carriers that were extremely busy last year. We expect them to still be busy this year, but perhaps not at the same pace. So I think that’s probably the main driver, those that are picking up and will really just be dependent on the timing of when we see that accelerate. So I think if you look at last year and you look at the pace at which it increased throughout the year, it’s probably a little bit more of a modest decline this year than it was an increase last year.
Jeff Stoops: We still see several or more than one, let’s say, picking up. And really, it’s just the delta between what decelerates versus what accelerates. But they are not all moving, I think. As you know, they are not all equal in terms of their build-outs and what they have accomplished. So the ones that are furthest ahead are likely to have more on the deceleration side, and the ones that still have a long way to go will be accelerating.
Phil Cusick: Jeff, we’ve mentioned a few years in the past where you’ve been pretty cautious to build in that acceleration in your guidance until you see the orders coming through. Is it fair to say that you’re fairly cautious on that acceleration in the current guide?
Jeff Stoops: In the aggregate, yes, with respect to certain individual U.S. carriers, I mean we know that there will be some acceleration in 2023. But again, the guide is to the aggregate, not just an individual carrier.
Phil Cusick: Thank you. And then if I can, one more, just how do you think about the math on buybacks now, right? Last quarter, you made clear that borrowing money at the current rates and buying stock where it was then just didn’t make a lot of sense in terms of accretion. I thought your comment today about sort of waiting for better opportunities was interesting. Do you think that either the private markets are going to start coming around given where rates are? Or do you anticipate that the sort of ratio between the current stock price and the current borrowing rates will change?
Jeff Stoops: Well, with the revolver, you have a guaranteed return 6%, right, to pay that back. And the corollary to that is a 16x, at least on today’s AFFO accretion, a 16x acquisition or stock repurchase. We’re always going to be stock repurchases, Phil, and it’s really a question of picking the right time against the right cost of debt capital and that may – there may be very well opportunities to do that this year and we will do that. In terms of acquisitions, I do think the market is starting to narrow the gap a little bit, but there is still a gap. And if we see opportunities like we did Tanzania or GTS, we will take a hard look. But we’re very financially-driven. And something we will have to look better, short, long, medium term than repaying our revolver. I mean we do think that interest rates will come down over time. We are going to be betting on the side of the Fed that they reduce inflation to 2% over time, and we know what effect that will have on interest rates. And when that plays itself out, we will have put ourselves in a great position to access incremental debt at prices that will be much more accretive to what we’re doing, and we’re happy to do that and wait for that time.
Phil Cusick: Great. Okay, thank you. Congratulations again.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Thank you. Good evening, and congrats to you, Jeff and Brendan. On leverage, I think you’ve noted a couple of times, 6.9%, below the target leverage level. So it sounds like even though you referenced perhaps getting to mid-6s, there is really no change despite the rate environment in your long-term target of 7% to 7.5%. Just wanted to clarify that? And then one of your peers noted on their earnings call in January that they are only seeing the big three carriers adding mid-band spectrum to about half of the towers in their portfolio. It would be great if you could just comment on what you’re seeing with your activity from those companies?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. You’re – what you said about how we’re thinking about leverage is absolutely correct, Simon. This is a period of time that we’re tactically steering – and we may not. We may see an acquisition tomorrow that looks much better than paying down the revolver at 6%. And if we do, that’s what we will do. But if we don’t, the natural result of the cash flows that we generate will be deleveraging, but it will only be temporary until such time as we believe incremental debt at the prices then available will create additional value, and that’s what we will do.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. And then on the carriers adding mid-band only half the sites, I can’t speak to what the others are talking about. I think it’s our belief and expectation that they will add it to the vast majority of their sites. That comment may have been related to where they are today, which parity. And there is still a long way to go, I think, is the overarching message here. A lot of our sites have not been touched yet. But based on backlogs and communications with our customers, we expect that, that will come over the coming years.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And actually, if you’re speaking today, Simon, we actually think that we’re a little bit less than that on the aggregate for all three. So there is a lot of work left to be done. But it ties into the question Ric asked me first that is the – what is going to cause the carriers to really spend everything this year to get there, and I think we have to see the killer 3G app that is going to provide the impetus to do that. I said 3G app, 5G app.
Simon Flannery: Right. So this is probably not a year where you necessarily will hit that 5% to 10% portfolio growth. You were strong last year. But if the opportunity is there, you’ll do it, but you’re not going to just do it to keep up that sort of target.
Jeff Stoops: No, no. And if you look at what we’ve done over the last 10 years on that metric of portfolio growth, I think we’re north of 10%. So it’s not every year necessarily. This may not be the year that we do that, but we did 15% last year. So I think overall, our views around portfolio growth and leverage have not changed.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Greg Williams with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Greg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just echoing the congrats to Jeff and Brendan. Just wanted to revisit the M&A landscape question. I mean there seems to be two camps on where multiples are headed in the private assets. One is – some believe private capital is going to – that’s on the sideline is eventually going to dry up and private multiples could come down a bit. The other camp, the scarcity of assets, especially U.S. assets and the tower multiples should stay elevated. It sounds like you’re waiting for rates to come down so the multiples will stay higher. I’m just curious to hear your thoughts on those views. Second question is just on service margins. I mean your service revenue is coming down understandably from record levels. But how should we think about the type of service activity and the margins year-over-year? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, I mean rates versus multiples. If you look at any kind of traditional economic analysis, there should be a relationship between one and the other. We didn’t see a lot of that over the last couple of years. As rates have gone up, multiples really did not drop the way they should have had, at least using our math. That’s starting to change a little bit, and we will have to see. We will have to see whether the amount of private capital on the sidelines will long-term push returns down in the acquisition market across the board. We’re not prepared to invest with those returns. We’ve got higher goals, and we pick and choose. And so far, I think we’ve been pretty pleased with the capital we’ve invested versus the return that we’re seeking, but I think it remains to be seen.
Brendan Cavanagh: And then Greg, on your services margin question, our outlook assumes a slightly lower margin for services work this year, and that’s based on primarily just a slight shift mix – sorry, shift in the mix of whether it’s construction or site act type of work. So the construction stuff is usually a little bit lower margin, also a mix on the type of work and who we’re doing the work for has some impact. But from a big picture standpoint, it’s a fairly small drop from what we had last year, and we will see how it shakes out. If it ends up being the same, we will have slightly better results than we projected.
Greg Williams: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: For the first question, I’ll preface this by saying that I realize it hasn’t even been 2 hours since you’ve given the full year 2023 guidance. But a question that keeps coming up is if the second half of 2023 in the U.S. business decelerates, what does that mean for growth in 2024? And Jeff, I realized you made some comments both in the release and on today’s call about some of those prospects. But just wondering if you could put more color on how you’d like investors to feel about this multiyear transition and leasing opportunity, if you could put some guardrails around it. And then just secondly, if you can give us an update on what the build-to-suit opportunities might look like more broadly over the next few years. And is there a way to accelerate that program to get greater portfolio growth?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I think the way we think about leasing, Michael, is there is a lot of work left to be done on our assets domestically and internationally to deploy 5G, multiple years’ worth of work. But ultimately, whether – how far that goes and at what pace will depend on how much and how fast carriers want to spend money. So we – it’s going to – we’re confident it’s going to occur. It’s just a question of when and at what pace. But the physical work that is yet to be done is tremendous. There is just a lot left to be done. Now I guess you could take the – because if you were a naysayer, you could take the position that, well, they are just never going to deploy all that spectrum that they spend all that money on, but that seems to be a bit forward. So, those are the guardrails that we are looking at. And right now, and this could certainly change based on pickups in activity, that we are going to have a very strong 2023, where the first half is weighted more heavily than the back half. And in terms of build-to-suits, we are pushing that business line, both in the U.S. and internationally. We continued to be financially-driven in the investments that we make in that area. So, not every build-to-suit is necessarily, at least in our view, an appropriate return on capital. But we are going to seek out and try and take all the ones that we think do fit those goals.
Michael Rollins: And just a curiosity, where are year one returns for the build-to-suit program?
Jeff Stoops: We are looking for 9%, 10%, 11% cash-on-cash returns, and that’s not every opportunity that’s out there.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. And that’s a multiyear. Year one will obviously vary depending on the specific situation. And frankly, Mike, that is the analysis around new build opportunities is not that different than it is for M&A, where a lot of these opportunities are competitively bid like the M&A deals are. They are just competitively bid with typically with carriers handing out those opportunities. So, we do our best when we are able to find strategic opportunities to build, but the volume there is obviously less. On the build-to-suit opportunities, we are making a financial decision. So, we would certainly like to continue to boost our portfolio numbers, but it’s all about the financial returns, and so we will be selective there just like we are on the M&A market.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Operator: And next, we will go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman: Thanks. And I will just echo everyone else’s congrats both, Jeff and Brendan. Two questions. One, the SG&A looked a little higher than we thought. I wasn’t sure if that’s a step-up related to some of the assets you acquired in the quarter, if maybe there is any inflationary pressures that are flowing through the P&L that we need to be thoughtful about as we model out next year or this year. And then you pointed out that the dividend payout is still a very low percentage of your AFFO. I am just wondering where are you in terms of the payout relative to your taxable income? And do you anticipate that the payout is going to be able to remain at a relatively low portion of your AFFO, or could something on the tax component of that change quickly over the next few years? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Just so on the – I will do the dividend one first. We have pretty significant NOL still. I believe the number is somewhere around $585 million of NOLs as of the end of the year. So, that gives us a decent runway, and we should be able to keep our percentage of AFFO at a manageable level. And although it will grow certainly each year, if we continue to grow our dividend at the same pace we have been, I still think we have got many, many years left based on how we model it out. On the SG&A side, going forward, we did include certain bigger increases in our outlook that are largely around inflationary-type costs. Most of our SG&A is people-related costs. And on average, we are giving bigger increases to people this year than we have in past years. Just cost of living is increasing, and also to be competitive in the marketplaces that we are in. So, it’s mostly that, there is nothing in particular, I think to call out on it otherwise.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. But I would echo you ought not assume that that’s going to be the same pace of increase over a multiyear period, Brett. Thanks.
Brett Feldman: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with SVB MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions and Jeff and Brendan, again, I also want to echo the other’s comments and congratulate both of you on the upcoming changes. I guess first, you noted in your prepared remarks that revenue placed under contract in Q4 wasn’t quite as strong as in Q3 and your backlogs have ticked down a bit. Are these changes of the magnitude you consider kind of typical in the course of business and to be expected? And can you share anything about what you have seen year-to-date in ‘23 along those lines?
Jeff Stoops: I mean they are clearly part of the cycle of wireless deployments over the last 20 years, Nick. We actually – we are looking at charts – internal charts today about the pace of activities on a quarterly basis, and this period of time really was some – one of the longest that we have seen going back to before the 3G to 4G upgrades. So, it’s not unusual. And deep down, there is two things that our customers really care about. Are they losing ground because there is some kind of great competitive pressure coming from somewhere, and what’s their free cash flow, and what did they promise the investment community. And what I think is going on now is simply a balance of that. But I would steer people to the comments we made earlier about this being a temporal thing because the physical amount of work yet to be done to bring 5G, at least to our assets, there is still a lot left.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. And then I also wanted to drill down a little bit into the agreement you reached with TIM. I think you said there would be about $10 million in churn from that in 2023. Does that take care of all of your expected Oi churn from TIM. Are there any benefits to SBA aside from the term extension? And just think about Oi more generally. I think in the past, you said you expected about $20 million to $30 million in total churn. With this deal done, should we assume, call it, $10 million to $20 million from the other acquirers, or are you now able to tighten that up some?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. First, yes. This would account for all of the Oi consolidation-related churn with TIM. There should not be any more based on the agreement that we struck. The total remaining would be – in the ballpark, I would say that it’s a little bit higher because of the GTS acquisition if you recall. So, I would call it 23% to 33% is – I am sorry, that’s a total $23 million to $33 million, minus the $10 million. So, yes, I mean I think we are – we will see where things go with the other carriers down there as we have conversations. So, those are to be seen, but for TIM, this would be it. Nick?
Nick Del Deo: Yes, sorry. And then aside from the term extension, nothing else to consider from our side of the deal?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean there are some other things. There are some other business commitments that are part of the agreement as well, and there is a variety of smaller things. But the main gist of this is some accelerated discount to their leases, long-term commitments across the entire portfolio, including non-Oi related agreements and some future business commitments.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi everyone. This is Alex on for Dave. First off, I just want to send our congratulations to you both Jeff and Brendan. Maybe just first on the international new leasing just flat year-over-year, does the expected cadence for that, should that – should we see that kind of ramp up through the year and exiting 2023? And then I know you just kind of touched on some of the carrier dynamics in Brazil. Could you maybe just touch on the spectrum auction as well as the recent presidential election last year? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. The international leasing revenue cadence should be fairly balanced throughout the year. Unlike in the U.S., when we talked about a decline, that’s really U.S.-related. Internationally, we would expect it to be pretty steady throughout the year. And then on the other – I am sorry, the other carriers in the 5G auctions. Yes, I mean we are – those auctions have put spectrum into the hands of these carriers. With the consolidation now of Oi, it’s going to – we believe it’s going to actually be positive long-term. Once they kind of get beyond these synergies, there is some work to be done here in this first year or 2 years post merger. But I think as they get beyond that in order to compete as we believe they will now much more on network quality and 5G services, we expect that to be a big driver of leasing growth going forward. And just as it happens here in the U.S. and in other markets, the need to put that spectrum to work is the only way to get that investment to pay off. So, we believe there is a lot of opportunity longer term now in Brazil as a result.
Jeff Stoops: And in terms of the political landscape, Lula obviously took the presidency, but the Bolsonaro group took the rest of Congress. So, you have what you have similar to the United States, which is a split Congress. And when that typically happens, it’s the same that occurs here, which is it’s very hard to get anything done there materially. And that ultimately, I think endures to the benefit of existing businesses. So, we don’t – in the current landscape, where you have that kind of a split representation, we don’t anticipate anything material coming out.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thank you And congrats to Jeff and Brendan on the new developments. There was a lot of questions on M&A. Maybe you could discuss potential new markets and give us an update on the Philippines and Tanzania. And then secondly, Brendan, if I heard you correctly, there weren’t any collections issues related to Oi, but accounts receivable did tick up about $67 million quarter-over-quarter. Maybe you could provide some color what’s behind that. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. On the last one, the tick-up is really actually just a timing issue in terms of collections because of the year-end. It’s as simple as where the holidays fall and where payments were made, plus there were some services-related AR that we expect will actually come down over time.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. In terms of M&A, I mean we continued to take an opportunistic approach to new markets. We will go into a new market based on our demographic and operational analysis as well as country stability, risk, taxation, currency. So, with certainly some exceptions that we would never look to go into under current circumstances, any country that we are not in today is a potential opportunity. And Tanzania is doing very well. Tanzania is ahead of our internal projections and the modeling that we did at the time of the acquisition. It is a dynamic country that is growing, and we are very optimistic about the future in Tanzania.
Brendan Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Next question.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you. Congrats to both. A couple of questions. First, on the domestic churn, you have been pushing it out throughout the last year or so. Is it truly just timing, or do you think that some of that decommissioning activity that the carrier anticipated is actually not going to pan out, or is it a mixture of both? And to the extent that you see activity from carriers where they support fixed wireless service, have you started to see some incremental amendment activity in that region, or is it too early to tell? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the domestic churn, the timing, which is all Sprint, T-Mobile merger-related is truly just timing. We expect that the total amount that we will incur will be the same as what we have kind of guided to in the past. We just think it takes a little bit longer to get some of that done, but we don’t expect any changes.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And in terms of the fixed wireless, we believe what our customers say that it basically is a product that results from excess capacity that currently exists in the network after at least where they have deployed a lot of mid-band spectrum. That really just works off the existing macros bat yet, so we haven’t seen anything that we would clearly and particularly identify as incremental. Although there have been some reports where microwave, millimeter wave spectrum would be broadcast off the macro sites to help with the fixed wireless initiative. We hope that comes to pass, obviously, but we haven’t seen that happen just yet.
Batya Levi: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Brendan, a question for you, the guidance for leasing, I am afraid I am going to ask this just a different way than everybody else has it. But the guidance for leasing for $72 million, you exited at about $21 million this quarter on my numbers. So, it seems to imply an exit rate in ‘23 of $15 million to $16 million. I guess is that right? And then as we think about building our forecast for ‘24 if you are exiting around that level, historically, you guys have grown new leasing by the $40 million to $50 million cap. What would be the swing factors in terms of keeping that $15 million to $16 million exit rate holding steady in ‘24 versus maybe trending lower? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. That’s in the right ballpark, Brandon, in terms of where we would think that we will exit that sort of what’s assumed in our $72 million number. That is in that range. What would swing it in terms of what happens after that is really dependent on what happens in terms of new bookings signed up during the second half of this year, the pace of that. If it’s ahead of our pace, it’s not going to have much impact on our assumed pace, it’s not going to have much impact on 2023, but obviously, it will drive what happens in 2024. So, it’s a little early to be able to talk about that, obviously, but the biggest impact is going to be based on what’s happening in terms of new business we are signing up the second half of this year.
Brandon Nispel: I guess just a follow-up on that. Two of your larger customers have sort of guided us to lower capital spending in ‘23 and ‘24. So, I am curious what would drive the leasing number to ever be better than $72 million. Do we need to see another spectrum auction? Is there going to be another sort of massive ground of densification of the existing spectrum bands? Is it a new customer? It’s going to be a new 5G use case, just trying to get a sense of sort of your thoughts around 5G more holistically in that regard.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think that it’s really a function of how many of our customers are hitting on all cylinders at the same time. It’s usually just concentration more than it is anything else. Our biggest lease-up periods throughout our history have come when all of our customers have been busy at the same time. Usually, that’s the biggest driver. If you have them do it over time, it just basically spreads it out more, but it doesn’t necessarily change the total. So, that’s probably the biggest answer. I mean obviously, there are other things that are out there that are more specific. I mean DISH has certain obligations in 2025. That of course, could be a driver to activity levels with them. T-Mobile’s got C-band spectrum that’s clearing at the end of this year as well as 3.45. They haven’t really deployed any of that. So, there is a variety of specific things that you could point to by carrier that could be drivers of accelerated activity at a given point in time, but that’s really to be seen in terms of the timing. Ultimately, though we expect all of those things to drive incremental business to our site, it’s just a question of when that happens.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And I would just add, and this comment goes throughout all the comments. We have been careful with our guidance and with our commentary not to get ahead of our customers. I mean ultimately, the answer to your question is how much money they decide that they are going to – we are not going to change the amount of money they are going to spend. They are going to spend what they decided they need to spend under the current competitive capital and other dynamics.
Brandon Nispel: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Hey. Thanks. Two questions on your guidance. I will ask on both upfront. The first one on the escalation guidance for your international markets, I was wondering if you could just comment on why given the higher CPI last year, why are we – we are seeing flat growth in that number year-over-year? And then on your discretionary CapEx guidance, I am assuming there is no acquisitions included in there, but it looks like it’s going to be up pretty significantly versus last year. Is that some data center investments, or is there any other type of CapEx that’s driving that higher in ‘23? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So, on the international escalations, the dollar amount is flat. The CPI was certainly elevated during 2022. We are projecting it to be lower in Brazil, which is by far, our largest international market in 2023. But it’s – while it’s lower next year, the timing of when those escalations take place has an impact. So, some of the higher escalations of ‘22, some of that benefit carries over into 2023, and our assumed lower rate obviously then offset some of that benefit. Plus, we have a little bit bigger base of business, of course, with the GTS acquisition in particular. So, when you put it all together, we ended up with basically about the same dollar amount of growth impact, but we are assuming that the CPI rates come down year-over-year. So, that’s offsetting what you might otherwise see as an increase. And on the discretionary CapEx, there is a small amount of contracted M&A in there, which we actually disclosed how much is under contract in our press release. But the balance of that is made up of assumptions we have made around new builds, around data center upgrades, around some DAS networks that we are investing in, basically everything else. The only thing that we don’t include in there is an assumption around M&A because it’s obviously lumpier and hard to identify what that’s going to be sitting here today. But the rest of our discretionary investment plans, the guidance kind of reflects those assumptions.
David Guarino: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we have no other questions in queue. I will turn the conference back over to you.
Jeff Stoops: Thank you, Eric. And thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to advising you on our progress in 2023 as we move through the year.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA’s third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2022 and beyond. In today’s press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, October 31 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our third quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We continued our very strong 2022 with another outstanding quarter. Our third quarter results were well ahead of our internal expectations and have allowed us to again increase our outlook for our full year results. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $587.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $575.6 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, but they were a headwind on comparisons to the third quarter of 2021, negatively impacting revenues by $3.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.9% over the third quarter of 2021, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 9.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 8% on a gross basis and 4.8% on a net basis, including 3.2% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity, or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter, was very solid again with meaningful contributions from each of our largest customers. The combination of our strong third quarter leasing activity level and faster-than-anticipated commencements of new amendments have allowed us to increase for the second consecutive quarter our outlook for new 2022 domestic site leasing revenue from organic lease-up. During the third quarter, amendment activity represented 58% of our domestic bookings, with 42% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented over 94% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Domestically, we also experienced less churn than we had projected due to timing of merger-related decommissionings being later than we had previously estimated. Our reduced 2022 domestic churn amounts are expected to shift to 2023. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.4% net, including 8.4% of churn or 13.8% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again as we had our best quarter of the year in terms of new revenue signed up. In addition to strong customer activity levels across many of our markets, we continue to see healthy contributions from inflation-based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another very strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.6% on a constant currency basis. As anticipated, international churn remained elevated in the quarter due primarily to carrier consolidations and Digicel’s previously announced exit from Panama. During the third quarter, 81.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.2% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $464.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.8% and an international tower cash flow margin of 67.3% or 91.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $446.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 67.3% in the quarter, impacted slightly by outsized services revenue. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 72.2%. Approximately, 95% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. During the third quarter, our services business again produced new record level results, with $88.3 million in revenue and $22.8 million of segment operating profit. We also continue to replenish and build even higher our services backlogs, finishing the quarter once again at a higher level than the prior quarter, notwithstanding our record third quarter results. Based on this backlog, our strong third quarter and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for full year site development revenue by $26 million. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO in the third quarter, was $339.4 million. AFFO per share was $3.10, an increase of 15.1% on a constant currency basis over the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 131 communication sites for total cash consideration of $54.9 million. We also built 113 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, on October 11, we closed on the previously announced acquisition from Grupo TorreSur, adding 2,632 sites in Brazil for cash consideration of $725 million. In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 34 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $28.5 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the first – excuse me, by the end of the first quarter of next year. In addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $9.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Based on results and activities during and subsequent to the third quarter, we have updated our outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook across all of our key metrics due to outperformance in the third quarter, lower churn expectations as a result of timing and the earlier closing of the GTS acquisition. These items were partially offset by higher interest costs and higher estimated cash taxes from the outlook previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. We are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance and excited for a strong finish to 2022. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.1 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.8x below the low end of our target range. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.3x, equaling the last two quarter’s all-time high. Subsequent to quarter end, we used cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the GTS acquisition closing. As a result, as of today, we have $995 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 2.9%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. The interest rate on 90% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock as we allocated capital for the closing of the Brazilian acquisition. We currently have $504.7 million of repurchased authorization remaining under our $1.0 billion stock repurchase plan. The company’s shares outstanding at September 30, 2022 were 108 million compared to 109.5 million at September 30, 2021, a reduction of 1.4%. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.7 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.71 a share, payable on December 15, 2022 to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 17, 2022. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening everyone. As is appropriate on Halloween, we are pleased to present a treat of an earnings report. The third quarter exceeded almost all expectations and benefited from the significant level of wireless deployment activity by our carrier customers. Notwithstanding the broader challenging macroeconomic environment, our business was extremely busy and we were able to again increase our full year outlook across all key metrics. We raised our full year outlook for total revenue by $49 million after raising it by $64 million last quarter. Domestic organic contributions to leasing revenue growth in the third quarter were the highest for the year and our outlook implies an even higher contribution in the fourth quarter. Our services business produced the highest quarterly contribution of revenue and gross profit in our history and we again grew our services backlog. Our rate of return on invested capital was 10.6% for the quarter, the highest in at least 10 years. It really was a remarkable quarter. In the U.S., each of our carrier customers remained busy during the quarter as they have throughout the year, building out their networks through the deployment of new spectrum bands. T-Mobile was our most active customer during the quarter, continuing their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon, AT&T and DISH were again very active in the quarter, with 5G-related new lease and amendment signings. Site leasing revenue growth from domestic new leases and amendments has been strong this year, growing throughout the course of the year. We expect the contribution to revenue growth from domestic leases and amendments to be good again next year as well based on the strength of the organic leasing activity during 2022. Internationally, we had our best organic leasing quarter of the year. During the third quarter, we saw more of a shift toward upgrades at existing sites, with 63% of new business signed up in the quarter coming from amendments to existing leases and 37% coming through new leases. International leasing activity was again led by strong contributions from Brazil and South Africa, our two largest markets. Brazil has performed very well this year. Not only has lease-up been above our internal expectations for the year, we have also had larger contributions from CPI-based escalators, while maintaining a relatively stable foreign exchange rate. In addition, we closed on the previously disclosed GTS acquisition of over 2,600 sites earlier in October. The integration of these sites has only recently begun, but is proceeding smoothly and ahead of plan. As a reminder, these sites have 2.1 tenants per tower and we believe there are opportunities for growth, particularly with recent 5G spectrum auctions in Brazil as a driver. These sites do contain some legacy oil leases, but a smaller percentage than the rest of our portfolio. With regard to Oi, we have begun conversations with some of the carriers that are absorbing the Oi wireless business to discuss potential mutually beneficial and efficient arrangements around the integration of these networks. We still anticipate total churn of approximately $20 million to $30 million associated with the Oi merger on our legacy sites plus an additional estimate of approximately $3 million associated with the GTS or Grupo TorreSur sites. These numbers do not include any potential impact to pass-through reimbursements as those items will be neutral to tower cash flow. We also continue to produce revenue from tenancies associated with Oi’s wireline business, which is unaffected by these mergers. We have a strong relationship with our Brazilian customers and look forward to working with them through this process. With respect to our balance sheet due to early refinancings completed over the last few years and some well placed interest rate swaps, we have positioned ourselves well to address more challenging debt markets. We ended the third quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.8x, below our target range at our lowest level in years. And even with our large fourth quarter Brazilian tower acquisition, we expect to be at or below 7.0x at year end. We have only one $640 million debt instrument maturing between now and October of 2024, representing approximately 5% of our debt outstanding. That instrument matures in March of 2023. And while interest rates are certainly higher today, we still have great access to incremental and refinancing debt capital given the strength of our cash flows. We expect to refinance our pending first quarter maturity during the next several months. During periods with an elevated cost of capital and increased interest rates, it is even more imperative to continue our disciplined and opportunistic approach to investing capital. We are fortunate to be in a strong industry, benefiting from the continued growth in wireless, but also having the strength of significant free cash flow generation, largely fixed cost and scaled operations. It is during times like these that we really appreciate the strength of our underlying business. We are very pleased with the third quarter performance. As indicated by our updated outlook, we are also well positioned to finish out 2022 on a high note. We will be providing our initial 2023 outlook on our next quarterly earnings call. But based on this year’s organic leasing activity and the significant network projects ahead of our customers, we anticipate our leasing results to continue to be strong into next year. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, focused on maximizing returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our customers and team members for their support and contributions to our success and we look forward to a strong finish to the year. And with that, Caroline, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: Good afternoon. So I was interested in two topics. One is what you might be seeing in terms of seller expectations or just general observations about domestic M&A and what’s going on with TCF multiples? And then secondly, in your conversations with your U.S. customers interested in – or to what degree infill or densification or cell splitting starting to come up as opposed to overlays, which I think has been driving the majority of the growth ex-DISH so far? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I will take the last one first, Jon. We are still at least with respect to SBA and its assets in the capacity stage and the overlay and the initial deployment of mid-band spectrum. While we fully expect densification to come, capacity for us continues to be the current driver. Now, we take that as a good thing, because that really just lengthens out the extent of the activity timeline for us. In terms of seller expectations, they are changing some. They have not fully reset to the degree that the public company multiples have compressed. What that means for SBA is there will be a lot of things that we take a pass on unless the price is right. We loved what we did in Tanzania. We loved what we did in GTS. There is a lot of things that we passed on because those expect – there is still a gap in those seller expectations. But they have started to move actually down.
Jon Atkin: And then lastly, just on international M&A and tuck-in opportunities, build-to-suits, what’s your appetite for that at the moment?
Jeff Stoops: We like build-to-suits provided they are the right terms. Tuck-in acquisitions and, for that matter, new markets would all fall into kind of the same comment I made about finding things that are right for us. And we’re only going to do things if we believe that it’s right for us from a price and a growth perspective. And as – if we do things great, if we don’t, you’ll see what happened in the third quarter, which is that we de-lever pretty quickly until we do see those right capital allocation opportunities.
Jon Atkin: Excellent. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks, and good afternoon. Curious if you could just share a little bit more details of the backlog. And are you still seeing an extended book-to-bill where it’s just taking longer for that backlog to get into the actual revenue numbers? And then separately, on just data centers and Edge opportunities, any updates on how you’re looking at the opportunities? How some of your tests are coming along? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I don’t know. Brendan, correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t know that we’ve had any changes in the book-to-bill.
Brendan Cavanagh: Nothing material. I will say that actually, if you noticed on our bridge for domestic contributions from new leases and amendments that we did up that contribution for 2022, it was 66 last quarter and 67 now. And that change is really largely due to a slight acceleration in timing, and that’s mostly around amendments that just kicked in a little bit quicker than we had projected. But it’s a pretty small change relative to the big picture. I don’t think there is been any material move in that you would point out.
Jeff Stoops: And on the Edge business, Mike, we’ve actually seen some great progress, but it’s still – it’s great from where we started, which was, of course, at zero. But it’s not really material. I would say we probably have either in operation or under construction 30 to 40 of these facilities. And the primary demand for them has been Edge computing and fiber and cable regeneration. But what we found to be the key to success in this area is really the state of and the location of the tower site because where it’s ready to go and it’s close to or on top of existing fiber makes all that much more attractive. So on an absolute basis, yes, we’ve seen a lot of growth. On a financial basis, it’s still, of course, very small. But we’re encouraged by what we’ve seen.
Michael Rollins: And within that context, is there a base expectation of the value enhancement? So if you look at what these 30 to 40 sites could do from a incremental cash flow, incremental value perspective? Is there a number that we all should be keeping in mind as the opportunity set?
Jeff Stoops: No, because it’s still small. What I will tell you, though, is that we’re really happy with the incremental return on invested capital for these projects. And at its core, that’s what I think you have hired us to do. So we’re very happy with that. And as long as we can make that return on invested capital, albeit small, perhaps for a little while, we’re going to keep doing it.
Michael Rollins: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Ric Prentiss: Good afternoon, everybody.
Jeff Stoops: Hey, Ric.
Ric Prentiss: It certainly is not get treats versus tricks tonight. Thanks, Jeff. First question I’d like to get into is, there is been a lot of debate out there. When you look at the U.S. business, it sounds like you have good visibility, so the leading indicator of services business sounds strong with record backlog. But we get the questions of aren’t the carriers trimming CapEx budget if you look at ‘23 versus ‘22? Not a perfect indicator CapEx. Potential for a recession in the U.S., interest rates are high. Does anybody need to go borrow to pay their CapEx? Help us understand how you’re feeling, it sounds quite positive, Jeff, as far as looking exiting ‘22 strong and then looking into ‘23 strong?
Jeff Stoops: Well, keep in mind, because of the nature of the business, where you sign things up today, but you don’t begin to recognize revenue until later that we’re today already shaping next year’s financial results. So that’s a point of confidence. The other thing I would say is that we track to the tower which of our customers have upgraded their mid-band spectrum on our sites. And the number is actually fairly low across the board for us at this point. And our customers will do what they will do. But knowing what this means for them in terms of the amount of the money, frankly, for first of all, that they spend on the spectrum the – at least as reported, competitive differences between some of them from a spectrum perspective and others, where they are on our towers and the fact that the CapEx numbers that you get from them are extremely broad. We feel next year is going to be pretty good.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. Other question. Obviously, you closed Grupo TorreSur. How should we think about the funding for that business in this environment? And as we look into ‘23, how much more interest expense should we be kind of already starting to think about from our side, even though you haven’t given guidance yet, but think about what that headwind might be? And do stock buybacks come back on the radar as we get into this year or early next year?
Jeff Stoops: Well, Grupo TorreSur is funded. I mean, that you say, think about the funding, that’s already funded. That got funded from cash on hand and our revolver. So the next thing we’re looking at is the refinancing of the $640 million ABS instrument in March where we’ve got that teed up, ready to go. I don’t want to speculate too much on the interest increase. There will be, of course, an interest increase. I mean, Brendan, what’s that instrument bearing today?
Brendan Cavanagh: The one that’s getting paid off is just below 3.5%. So you should expect that, that will be significantly higher.
Jeff Stoops: Well, let’s put a little parameters around that. I mean, we’re thinking it’s going to have a 6 handle on it, right?
Ric Prentiss: Okay. Okay.
Jeff Stoops: But then – but keep in mind, we’re going to be producing over $1 billion of AFFO. We don’t have another debt instrument due until October of 2024. So we’re going to be in great shape. We’re going to have capital to invest and it’s either going to get – we’re either going to see value in portfolio acquisitions based on my earlier comments. We may or may not. We are going to be – continue to be opportunistic around stock repurchases or third and I would say this is somewhat unlikely given the first two, you are going to see a big decline in our leverage ratio.
Ric Prentiss: Okay, that helps a lot. Everybody, stay well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Landon Park: This is Landon on for Simon. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could expand on any specifics domestically from what you’re seeing from Dish or any of the other carriers in terms of where you think they are at in their deployments.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I don’t want to get too granular. All of the – well, let’s say, T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T all still have work to do with us based on our analysis of where they are with their mid-band spectrum. Some of those are further ahead than others. And I think the answer to that question has been well reported. And then Dish has really got a lot of business signed up, and their focus right now is getting all that on air to meet the June 2023 requirements, which based on everything we can tell, they are in a very good position to do. And then we expect them to come back and begin to work on the 2025 requirements. So while it’s varied landed in terms of which of those are busiest, and I don’t think they want me actually commenting on that. I will tell you that there is a high level of business from all of them. And they all, at least based on our analysis, still have a lot to work, a lot of work left to do on our portfolio.
Landon Park: Thanks for that color, Jeff. And then just one follow-up on the Edge deployment commentary, can you maybe describe what these sites look like, the 30 to 40 that are in operation under construction and build costs, size of the facilities? And maybe what percent of your sites do you think are potentially eligible over time to have such deployments?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I think they are mostly 6x12 or 10x20-foot shelters that look like the traditional wireless shelter that certain carriers have used historically. They have got air conditioning. They have got a lot of logistics to check temperatures and alarms and things like that. They basically are for racks of equipment, and they start out with two or three rack capacity and can be expanded beyond that. And Brendan, what are we – what’s our average cost on those?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, it depends on the size and the scale, obviously. Deployment there for something along the lines of what Jeff described, you’re looking at somewhere in the $100,000 range. But if we do a bigger, more fulsome Edge, it compute through data center where it’s a bigger operation, it can be as much as $400,000 or $500,000.
Landon Park: And how much power do you have – would you have going to those facilities?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, they are not – at that size, they are not being sold on a traditional data center power basis. A lot of the uses today are for regeneration of signal for cable and fiber companies. And that’s not really how that’s priced and sold.
Landon Park: Okay, thanks very much for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk from LightShed. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Thanks. Jeff, just going back to Rick’s question, can you give us or define what low means in terms of the number of cell sites that mid-band? Are you talking like sub-10%, sub-20% something in the ballpark?
Jeff Stoops: The most populated of the carriers would be in their satisfaction rate on our towers would be in the 50%ish range and others are below that.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. And then Comcast has this radio from Samsung, it does 2.5 and it has low been in there. I guess, first part of the question is, have you had any type of meaningful dialogue with Comcast and Charter about helping them with their offload strategy? But then more importantly, I guess, when that inevitability does happen, if you look at like three scenarios, one where they just said, hey, we have a radio that just does CBRS and the antenna that goes along with that. Scenario two is we’re doing low band and CBRS, so that’s probably a different type of antenna, maybe larger. And then the third alternative is the low band that they have is deeper, meaning like rather than 5 megahertz in Comcast case, they go out, they lease some additional low band and they are using 10 megahertz of spectrum. Would the leases differ between those three scenarios? Because I’ve seen that you recall over the past many years that you would argue that like, hey, when someone put on the spectrum, we get more money. So for a new leaser or a new tenant, would it be the same way where if they came to you with one of those three alternatives that there would be different pricing?
Jeff Stoops: Just based on the nature of the spectrum is being transmitted?
Walter Piecyk: Yes, and nature.
Jeff Stoops: Probably. Probably not. Probably it’s all going to be based on the way the equipment looks. And based on your description of the third alternative lower band, deeper lower band, I mean, as you’re describing it, I’m envisioning that’s going to be the most intensive on the equipment side. So they would be based on that, Walt, as opposed to the fact that they are transmitting their own. I mean, even though CBRS is shared and not necessarily owned, we wouldn’t differentiate somebody’s use of CBRS versus their use of their own spectrum, I don’t believe. I don’t think we ever have put it that way.
Walter Piecyk: And has there been any meaningful discussions up to this point?
Jeff Stoops: We are always in discussions with Charter and Comcast. But I would say that those scenarios that you lay out, for my personal opinion, I think they are still somewhat in the future.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
Walter Piecyk: Yes, understood. Very well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Your line is open.
Batya Levi: Thank you. Can you remind us the overall financial impact of the GPS side, if there are any changes to the original expectation? And how much revenue was pulled forward? And Network Services, you mentioned the strength and you added more to the backlog. Could we expect a similar performance next year on that segment? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. GTS, the numbers aren’t any different than what we gave last quarter. So, the total revenue on an annualized basis is expected to be approximately $72 million. The impact from the pull forward of closing a little bit early was about $3 million.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And in terms of services, I mean we have a backlog that supports a fourth quarter performance similar to what we enjoyed in the third quarter. That’s not what we have guided to because we exceeded our expectations so greatly in, Q3 and Q4 has some holidays and all that. And in terms of next year, we really wouldn’t hazard a guess until we have the benefit over the next four months or five months prior to when we give out full year 2023 guidance.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, good evening guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just looking at the change in guidance, what’s the jump in other revenue in the U.S. coming from? Is that decommissioning fees or something similar and how much of that was in Q3 versus what you expect in Q4?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. It was – almost all of the jump is related to Q3, I would say. And it is related largely – it’s a variety of things. But cash basis revenues, a portion of that, a big chunk of that is related to what we might call holdover fees, extra fees that are paid for somebody staying on the tower that’s coming off, but they stay longer than they should. It also includes internationally payments from Digicel. We mentioned Digicel is a big contributor to the churn number internationally, which they are, but they have actually continued to make a number of payments. And so those payments are showing up basically in other now.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. That’s great. And I guess I also wanted to ask about expense trends that you are observing in the U.S. Obviously, the majority of your OpEx is ground rent escalators and that are fixed. So, that takes a lot of risk off the table. But what are you seeing and expecting as it relates to the rest of your expense base, like corporate, field operations and so on?
Jeff Stoops: We are seeing definitely some inflationary pressure there, Nick. And we are going to be giving out average compensation increases next year at a higher rate than we have given in the last couple of years. But when you look at – I think we are – our SG&A is only like 6% cash, cash SG&A, 6% of revenue. I mean it’s just – it just really doesn’t matter on the overall financial numbers. But we would be lying to you if we said that we were immune to that kind of stuff. But for us, it’s just so much smaller of a percentage than it is for a lot of other companies.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. That’s great. And if I can squeeze in one last quick one. Obviously, as we look at the growth overseas, the value of the CPI-linked escalators are really showing their value in the current environment. Are there any caps on major contracts that we should be cognizant of, or are you guys uncapped on that front, and hence, essentially totally protected?
Brendan Cavanagh: We are largely uncapped. I am trying to think if there are any, there may be one or two somewhere out there. But for the most part, it’s not capped.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Williams from Cowen. Your line is open.
Greg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, if I may. Can we talk about your Latin American churn? If I look at your guidance, it should be still up here in these 8% levels? I am just trying to figure out how much of that spills over into 2023? Do we remain at these 8% levels over the next few quarters given the Oi cadence and the consolidation churn in digital, etcetera? Second question is just on the service revenue, actually, the service margin profile. How do you expect that to pan out? Are we shifting from maybe permitting to more construction? And I think you hit a margin close to 26%, and wanted to see where that shakes out over the next few quarters. Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I mean I will take the latter question first. And Brendan, you can do the American churn. We are executing very well, Greg, on both the traditional permitting and zoning side of the business, as well as the construction side. So, the margin differential that you saw years ago between those two lines of our services business, they are not exactly the same, but the gap has closed tremendously. So, we still get a better margin on the zoning and the permitting side of things than we do on the construction. So, the mix of that will impact the margins. But I mean I don’t think it’s going to be a hugely different margin next year. I think based on the way the work will flow and how we expect things to come in for business that has – I mean the first business that we typically see for any kind of new interest is going to be on the zoning and permitting side. So, I think it’s not going to change a whole lot.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. And then Greg, on the international churn piece, I would expect that the next couple of quarters, few quarters probably, will be in a similar range in terms of that percentage that you are looking at because of the timing of when some of the stuff started. The one thing I would also caveat about next year is just, this obviously only takes into account what’s happened now, and there is – the one big thing that’s out there that we are in the midst of conversations about is related to the Oi consolidation in Brazil. And as of today, there is nothing to report on that. But as we continue to have conversations, depending on where those end up, that may influence what next year’s numbers look like.
Greg Williams: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Dave Barden: Hey guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I got a bunch, Jeff, for you. I think the first most important is, what are you going as for trick or treating tonight with your kids? The second…
Jeff Stoops: I am going as a grandfather.
Dave Barden: Yes. I am still interested in the costume. So, the second question is, you kind of highlighted the leverage being below the target. There was a time when you guys implemented your dividend that you thought maybe a lower leverage target would be the right target. I wondered if you would want to have a little bit of a conversation about how you are thinking about target leverage. And given that there is not a ton to do on acquisitions and you didn’t do stock buybacks, even though stock has been pulling back, whether there has been some sort of change there. And if…
Jeff Stoops: There really hasn’t been a change there. I mean clearly, we have maintained our target but have operated almost entirely at the low end now for some time. And I think that’s going to continue to be the case, if not dropping below. But the dropping below, if that happens, is going to be more a function of our dissatisfaction with poor capital allocation opportunities and some financial theoretical belief that this is the optimum leverage level given our access to capital. And one of the thing, and you may be driving at this, Dave, we are not going to turn into a high dividend relative to AFFO company. We just don’t think that’s the right thing to do. We will grow our dividend probably as faster, faster than well, certainly our peers and maybe anybody else in the REIT industry as we have the last couple of years. But it’s still going to be lower as a percentage of AFFO because we like the flexibility that it provides.
Dave Barden: Okay. Great. And then the second question I had was one of the things that distinguished you guys from peers has been a pivot to fixed rate debt. Obviously, that changed a little bit with GTS. I think someone asked earlier about the plan for the GTS that you guys talked about the refinancing of the ABS, but I don’t – what is the plan for the variable rate debt in the portfolio? I guess this is one for Mark. Are you going to go – are you going to lock in higher fixed rates, or are you going to try to rated out in the meantime?
Mark DeRussy: It will be a mix of both. We have, as you probably have noticed from our prior ABS financings where we have the opportunity to raise more than the amount to be refinanced, we have been rated for issuance well above 640. We are trying to figure out exactly how far above that that we go. So, there will be some reduction in the revolver from that, and then the rest of it is going to occur pretty quickly from cash flow.
Dave Barden: Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you. And then my last question, if I could, please, Jeff is, I have always kind of considered you a little bit of a Brazilian policy wonk. Now that the election is over, how – what do you think is next in terms of implications for the telecom industry, currency, etcetera? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Well, we all know that Lula is left of Bolsonaro, but he has gotten elected by a coalition of not only the more left us, but also some more centrist populations as well. At the same time, if Lula got elected President, the Congress down there got actually more to the right. So, you are going to have a classic draw between the President and between Congress, and Congress has a lot of power in Brazil. So, I think for us, it’s going to continue to be kind of a good business environment without a lot of policy changes. That’s – I mean I think the whatever – and I don’t know that he would have proposed anything. But assuming, for hypothetical purposes, that Lula proposed some things that would be very much to the left and detrimental to business, I don’t think that’s going to happen because of the Congress.
Dave Barden: Okay. Thank you, guys. I really appreciate.
Jeff Stoops: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Guarino from Green Street. Your line is open.
David Guarino: Thanks. Hey Jeff, I wanted to make sure I am understanding your enthusiasm for domestic new leasing activity next year, especially compared to one of your peers that gave ‘23 guidance that implies a step down from macro tower new leasing activity. So, I guess the question is really your ‘22 guide this year for $67 million in new leasing activity. Do you think we are going to look back on that as a high watermark, or do you think that there is actually room for that to grow going forward?
Jeff Stoops: I am glad you asked that question because when we are conveying good feelings about next year, it’s exactly around that number for 2022. That same calculation and that same thing that we will be posting when we start our bridge for next year – next earnings release, that’s really what we are speaking to. So, I think I just answered your question.
David Guarino: Alright. I can read through that. And second one then switching gears on it. Given the volatility and the pretty rapid change we have seen this year in a lot of foreign currencies, maybe not the experience in Brazil, but certainly a lot of other markets. Have you reconsidered how you underwrite the risk for international investments relative to what you might have been doing at the start of the year?
Jeff Stoops: Not really because the rate of currency movement has largely been matched off by the CPIs in those countries.
Brendan Cavanagh: And all of our revenues in those countries are escalated based on CPI. There will be some minor exceptions to that plus or minus. But in general, that relationship has helped.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch from Barclays. Your line is open.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe on the debt, again, given the macro environment, has your ability to tap into the secured debt market changed recently? And do you think that will continue to remain a primary source of funding going forward?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Brendan, we do think that it will remain a primary source of funding for us. Our ability to tap into it has not really been impacted. It’s really just a question of cost. That’s the only question mark. But the access to capital and having plenty of capital available to us in those markets still remains very strong.
Brendan Lynch: Okay. Great. And then just one other question. It looks like your discretionary CapEx guidance came down by about $35 million for the year. Is that related to labor availability or supply chain constraints or other rising costs that might be leading to a slowdown in development projects?
Brendan Cavanagh: No. It’s mostly just timing of some smaller acquisitions and when we think they are going to close.
Brendan Lynch: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Brandon Nispel: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. Jeff, you guys talked about commencements coming in a little bit quicker than expected. But could you update us on the backlog of unsigned lease applications? Where do you stand today relative to a year ago and last quarter? Then for Brendan, obviously, international CPIs have been high, but have come down a little bit, at least in Brazil. I guess if we put estimates aside today, inflation stayed where it’s at, what should we be looking for, for that escalator next year? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. In terms of our backlog for leases, new leases and amendments, we are just a tad off of where we were at the end of second quarter, which was one of the highest that we have had in many, many, many years. So, we are still looking at a very, very strong backlog, which just underlies a lot of our optimism going forward. And Brendan, I am going to let you handle the second question.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean you are asking me to predict the CPI for next year in Brazil, which it’s hard to do with certainty, especially given the recent elections and all that, we have to kind of see how that all settles out. But I think high-single digits is a reasonable assumption today, and perhaps it could be higher than that. But I would target somewhere in that 8% to 10% range.
Jeff Stoops: Well, I mean there is going to be a forward curve out there. I mean we do planning around those things because nobody has an accurate crystal ball on that. We rely on the published consensus forward curve [ph].
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, the big thing though, Brandon, for us is some of it comes down to timing. Obviously, we have concentrated periods at which our leases escalate. So, depending on where things are during those windows of time, it has either a greater or lesser impact on our specific numbers.
Brandon Nispel: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue at this time.
End of Q&A:
Jeff Stoops: Great. Thanks Carolyn and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to our next release in February, where we will talk about 2023 and happy Halloween.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, VP of Finance. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2022 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, August 01, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our second quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA continued building on our strong first quarter with an even better second quarter with across the board results ahead of our expectations and backlog supportive of an equally good or possibly even better second half of the year. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $580.2 million and cash site leasing revenues were $570.4 million. Foreign exchange rates were largely in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, but we're a tailwind on comparisons to the second quarter of 2021, positively impacting revenues by $3.4 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.4% over the second quarter of 2021, including the impact of 3.7% of churn. On a gross basis same-tower growth was 8.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.1% on a gross basis and 4.1% on a net basis, including 3% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter was very strong again and incrementally higher than the first quarter of this year. In addition, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlogs remain very healthy as well. The combination of our strong second quarter leasing activity level and our backlogs have allowed us to increase our outlook for new 2022 domestic site leasing revenue from organic lease up. During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 66% of our domestic bookings with 34% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Dish; represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.6% net, including 7.1% of churn or 12.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again and also higher than we saw in the first quarter. We continued to see strong customer activity levels in many of our markets, as well as increased contributions from inflation based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another particularly strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 14.2% on a constant currency basis. International churn was elevated in the quarter as anticipated, due primarily to carrier consolidations and other customer financial challenges, mainly in Guatemala and Panama. During the second quarter, 80.6% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in US dollars. The majority of non-US dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil with Brazil representing 13.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $459.6 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong with a second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.9% and an international tower cash flow margin of 67.2% or 90.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. International tower margins were impacted on a year-over-year basis by our new, less mature Tanzania assets. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $437.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.2% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 73.3%. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. During the second quarter, our services business produced record results for the fifth quarter in a row with $71.8 million in revenue and $17.3 million of segment operating profit. We also continued to replenish and build even higher our services backlogs finishing the quarter once again at a higher level than the prior quarter, notwithstanding our record second quarter results. Based on this backlog, our strong second quarter and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for full year site development revenue by $40 million. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the second quarter was $335.3 million. AFFO per share was $3.07 an increase of 16.3% over the second quarter of 2021. During the second quarter, we continue to expand our portfolio acquiring 210 communication sites and one data center in Brazil, which we previously disclosed with our first quarter results for total cash consideration of $127.3 million. We also built 100 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase approximately 200 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $85 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract, by the end of the year. In addition, during the quarter, we entered into a contract with Grupo TorreSur or GTS to purchase their remaining approximately 2,600 tower sites in Brazil for $725 million. We anticipate closing on this acquisition during the fourth quarter of this year and expect these assets to produce approximately $68 million of tower cash flow during the first full year following closing, based on our current estimates of future exchange rates. These are assets we know well in a market we obviously know well, and this acquisition will be immediately accretive to AFFO per share upon closing. Jeff will share a little more about this acquisition in a moment. In addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $9.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years to land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now to the rest of the year, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook across all of our key metrics based on a combination of outperformance in the second quarter, strengthening activity levels in both services and leasing, lower churn expectations and anticipated contributions from the pending GTS acquisition. These items were partially offset by weaker foreign exchange rates and higher interest costs from the outlook previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. We are excited about the current operating environment and pleased with how our team has been able to execute in order to produce better than expected results and support our customers at a high level with all of their network initiatives. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who'll provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt and $12.3 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualize adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.0 times, which is at the low end of our target range. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.3 times equaling last quarter, the highest in the company's history. As of the end of the quarter, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt was 2.9% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.3 years and the interest rate on 93% of our outstanding debt is fixed. And as of today, we have $480 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. During the second quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock as we chose instead to pursue the Brazil acquisition. We currently have $504.7 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at June 30, 2022 were 107.9 million compared to 109.5 million at June 30, 2021, which is a reduction of 1.5%. In addition, during the second quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.6 million or $0.71 cents per share and today we announced that our board of directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.71 a share an increase of 22.4% over the third quarter of last year. The dividend will be payable on September 20, 2022 to shareholders of record as the be close of business on August 25, 2022. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. As you have heard, we had another great performance in the second quarter. All areas of our operations were very busy and executed at a very high level producing better than expected financial results and setting us up well for the second half of the year. Despite higher interest rates and weaker FX rates, we have meaningfully increased our full year outlook in all areas, including a $64 million increase in anticipated total revenue. Our strong results and increased outlook are driven by the current network investment initiatives around the globe. While there is a range in the degree of activity from each of our customers around the globe, collectively, they are producing very high levels of demand, which we expect will keep us very busy for the remainder of this year and well into 2023. As of this moment, we are not seeing any material adverse impact on our activity levels from supply chain labor or COVID-19 issues. In the US, each of our carrier customers remain busy during the quarter signing up new leases and amendments primarily associated with the build out of their networks through the deployment of new spectrum. T-Mobile was very active during quarter and continued their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon and AT&T each increased their 5G related signings with us from the first quarter with each focused on C-band deployments and AT&T beginning to incorporate 3.45 gigahertz spectrum into their deployments as well. And Dish also contributed to the quarter continuing to sign up new lease agreements in support of their nationwide 5G network build out. We are excited about the upcoming 2.5 gigahertz auction, which will result in even more spectrum being deployed Internationally, we also had one of our best organic leasing quarters in a while, coupled with increased CPI based escalators in a number of our markets. International leasing activity was again led by strong new lease and amendment activity in Brazil, but we also saw significant executions in a number of our other markets, including South Africa and El Salvador. During the second quarter, we signed up 51% of new international revenue through new leases and 49% through amendments to existing leases; so almost evenly balanced. The combined US and international new leasing revenue signed up during the second quarter were the best we have produced in about seven years. On top of these outstanding leasing results, our services business had its best quarter in company history, producing record services revenue, and margin results for the fifth quarter in a row. Our services backlog finished the quarter at its highest level ever increasing our confidence in US carrier activity for the balance of the year and allowing us to increase our services outlook by 33% over the initial guidance we provided in February. I am extremely pleased with the job our team has done to deliver outstanding support to our customers during this critical time. In addition to our strong operational performance during the second quarter, we maintained our disciplined and opportunistic approach to capital allocation. This quarter, we pursued a very attractive portfolio growth opportunity evidenced by our agreement to buy the remaining 2,600 towers owned by GTS in Brazil. GTS is one of the longest tenured independent tower companies in Brazil run by industry veterans we have known and respected for many years, individuals who know how to properly run a tower company. The majority of these sites are located in Sao Paul state and most are located in urban or suburban areas. The sites have 2.1 tenants per tower, and we believe there are opportunities for growth, particularly with recent 5G spectrum options in Brazil as the driver. This will be our second acquisition of towers from GTS. We like the current dynamic in Brazil quite a bit, and we are pleased to incorporate these high quality assets into our portfolio at a very accretive price. On this portfolio O8 and legacy Nextel leases represents 17% of the business. So while these towers present some variability around future churn outcomes, we believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize the future of these assets. This acquisition will increase SBAs total portfolio in Brazil by over 25% to over 12,500 sites and we expect the towers will be integrated with little to no incremental SG&A expense. We believe this increased size and scale will be an asset in upcoming OI consolidation discussions and will also position us well to capture more of the necessary incremental network investment that will be required of the remaining three legacy M&Os. Finally, we will be able to absorb this transaction while still maintaining leverage in our target 7 times to 7.5 times range. We expect this will be a very complimentary value enhancing investment in a market that we know very well. With regard to our balance sheet, we remain in good position. We have only one debt instrument representing 5% of our outstanding debt maturing in the next two years. 93% of our debt is fixed rate and our weighted average interest rate remains very low at 2.9%. With respect to that one instrument due March, 2023, our plan is to refinance that in the next six months as we watch and stay opportunistic around the credit markets. While incremental interest rates are higher, our access to capital remains very strong and we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we have historically used. We are really very well positioned to weather the challenging, broader macro environment. In addition to our strong balance sheet, growing AFFO and the steady and growing operational environment of our industry, the majority of our largest costs are fixed or increases our cap. As a result, we believe we are not only able to withstand the current inflationary environment, but we are able to continue growing our AFFO per share, creating additional value for our shareholders. In closing, we are very pleased with our first half of 2022. Our team performed well against a very strong demand environment. I expect more of the same throughout the rest of the year and into 2023. I want to thank our customers and team members for their support and contributions to our success. I also want to take a brief moment to recognize and thank both Kurt Bagwell, our President of International and Tom Hunt, our General Council for their decades of service to SBA. Both will be retiring at the end of this year, but each has left an indelible mark on SBA and the industry. I appreciate their sacrifices and contributions and wish them all the best in retirement. And with that Moses, we are now ready for questions.
Operator:  And first we go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. First curious if you give us an update on the domestic leasing environment and in particular, are you seeing any change in activity from AT&T after announced some of the progress it's made on mid band spectrum deployment and also what you're seeing out of dishes build, and then just secondly, with regards to the acquisition, can you talk a little bit more about how the valuation might be contemplating that 17% of leasing that could be subject to some future RA rationalization? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, clearly I'll take the last one first Mike. Clearly, 10.5 times is extremely attractive price that takes into account exactly that. We don't really believe any of the next revenue will stay on and we have heavily discounted the oil revenue as well in our underwriting. So yes, all that was taken into account when we arrived at the price. In terms of AT&T, I listened to their call and heard their comments and based on our observations in our markets, which are mostly suburban highway corridor and rural. I think the numbers that they were talking about mostly came from dense urban markets, which makes a lot of sense because that's how all new -- that's where all new generational upgrades start. So we still have in our opinion, a very, very long way to go with, AT&T and their C-band and 3.45 work and Dish is a very active contributor. They would represent most all of the new leases that we are signing domestically. So there will be some ebbs and flows as they work around their will have a -- they have already worked around their 2022 regulatory requirements and are now going to be working towards their 2023 regulatory requirements, but still a very, very active participant.
Operator: Next, we'll go to line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: With the leasing activity ramping up towards the end of the year, do you think that bodes well for the activity we should expect for '23? I know you're going to provide formal guidance later, but in terms of trajectory, some comments would be helpful to think about puts and takes into next year. And another question on churn it has been coming lower than you had expected. Is that pushed out to next year or are you seeing lower decommissioning than you had prior expectations? Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, I think Batya, the most we could say about the trajectory is that the fourth quarter of this year we believe will be the highest growth rate of the year and we'll let you extrapolate what that means going forward. And obviously we'll give a full review when we give our 2023 guidance. Brendan, I'm going to let you take the churn question.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, the churn is -- it is mostly you should think of it as rolling into next year or future year it's largely timing related as opposed to below our expectations. It's just the timing primarily around the Sprint, T-Mobile decommissioning is a little bit more deferred than the estimates that we had made, but we don't expect the total to really be any different.
Batya Levi: Great. Maybe just to follow up on that, Brendan, I think you had originally said maybe it's $30 million in '22. Should we assume that it's closer to $27 million now, and then if you could give us a guidance for '23, that'd be great.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, it was well, last quarter we actually brought it down about $3 million and we brought it down about another $3 million this quarter. So this year is probably closer to '24 that's what's assumed in our numbers right now for '22, for 2022. And next year we're probably somewhere in the $15 million to $25 million range. It's a fairly wide range, but obviously there are some uncertainties around exact timing, but somewhere in that $20-ish million level.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Want to follow up on some of Michael's questions? Why was now the right time? Was it just the right price as far as doing the GTS deal and help us understand maybe as we should think about total exposure to Nextel and timing for Nextel to affect your international operations and I've got a follow up.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, it was the right time because the opportunity presented itself at a time and on terms where we thought it was very attractive for our future value creation. What's going on in Brazil right now is, they've got a fairly hawkish central bank. They have -- I think they're little bit ahead of the US in terms of their economy having, being dancing around a recession. The demand, notwithstanding that for cellular and 5G continues to mushroom in Brazil. You have, you know, this rationalization going on with the oil transaction for three carriers who now have bought a lot of new spectrum that needs to be deployed and are in a better market share position to do all that. So we like the dynamic a lot, Rick and we know these assets well and we know the sellers well, and all things kind of came together in the right way.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, Rick, we've been kind of ballparking on our portfolio of at about $20 million to $30 million US over the next many years. This portfolio actually reduces our exposure to oil on a percentage basis in Brazil, but would probably add somewhere in the $3-ish million of incremental oil churn would be our current estimate.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. And you all know me. I really harp on this whole amortization of prepaid rent. I don't like it. I know you have to account for it. It's just -- it's not cash. Yours has been very tiny. I think about $25 million. Crown did acknowledge and provide a table, this earning season on where their level was at $560 million, drop it to maybe $450 million maybe going in and lower American tower talked about theirs had been maybe $140 million dropping to $110 million. Should we think of your kind of $25 million a year as a good number because again, we really think cash, AFO and funds available for distribution is the right way to do valuations.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah. That's -- obviously it's been trending down. Part of the reason it's trending down Rick is because as we've done amendments and had longer terms to some of our tenant leases, you amortize it over a longer period of time. So it's actually had a reducing effect. So it really is just a function of how much augmentation work we do that we get reimbursed for and which leases that relates to how much time they have. But I think based on the way that it's trended, that number that you just mentioned of $25 million or so is probably a reasonable estimate, but it's been higher in the past and it's been lower. So, we'll see how it goes, but, I think that's a reasonable estimate.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. We're always going to disclose it very specifically, Rick, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. This isâ¦
Ric Prentiss: I love getting paid, right?
Jeffrey Stoops: Understand it for what it is. So it's not something we look to discourage but you can depend on us that it's always going to be clearly marked out.
Ric Prentiss: It's great for return on capital. I just like to think of it as net capital return on yield kind of thing, as opposed to an AFFO number. I just don't like it an AFFO.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, no, I hear you.
Operator: Next we'll go to line of Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good evening. On the M&A market obviously the transaction multiple, you said it's accretive. It's certainly lower than we've seen elsewhere. Do you think this was a particular situation given the oil exposure, given the Brazil market, or do you sense a turn that maybe it's going to be easier to be a buyer in the private markets than it has been for the last couple of years? Anything changing there either in towers or for ground leases, etcetera. And then on the leverage you came down to seven point times, obviously rates have been rising, you've got a great liquidity profile, but any updates you want to stay more towards the lower end or are you still happy right within that 7 to 7.5 going forward in this rate environment?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think as long as we can continue to produce the organic growth Simon, we're fine in the 7 to 7.5 times. But, if we don't find good things to buy, it'll obviously be trending lower. In terms of your first question, I think there are some breaks on the margins that are happening around the world in terms of seller and buyer expectations coming more together. But in this particular case, this was more a situation of these particular assets, our familiarity with them, the fact that it was the last tranche of towers that the seller had and needed to sell them to basically liquidate some funds and do some things that private equity needs to do. So I would attribute it more to this deal that I would a wholesale change in the buying environment. Although I do think that is improving.
Simon Flannery: And what sort of clarity can you give us on the -- or what have you assumed on the timing of the next oil churn for these assets?
Jeffrey Stoops: It's over the next several years. Some of it is specific to the timeframes that of the terms of those agreements, Simon and they're all spread out to different dates but you should assume over the next three years roughly on average, but it won't be even, it'll be certain amount each.
Simon Flannery: So, that's $68 million includes presumably some churn in the next 12 months after closing.
Jeffrey Stoops: A little bit. Yes.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Thanks for taking my questions. First, two quick clarifications first for Brendan. Brendan, you said that you expect about $3 million in oil churn from the GTS towers. Can, you share what your expectation is for the next churn?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I don't want to give the exact number but, there the oil, well, as Jeff said, we're assuming that all of the next revenue goes away. The total for oil and next tell is about 17%. So Nextel is roughly half of that. So you can probably do the math from there.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. That's great. Thanks. And then your expectation for other revenue in the US in '22, went from zero last quarter to $5 million this quarter, what that a function of, and was that realized this quarter?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, it was realized this quarter. It's basically there's a few different things in there, but it's essentially what we consider cash basis revenue, which is stuff that we're collecting kind of one off. Sometimes there's extra fees that are paid or holdover fees, things that are not part of the recurring ongoing lease. So we classify it as other, but the increase is really that we got more of that than we expected. So almost all of that is stuff that we realized in the second quarter. There may be a small amount of projected for the second half of the year, but most of it was actually realized.
Brendan Cavanagh: Stuff that doesn't go in the $66 million bucket. Right because, we want to be careful as to how folks think about that year after year after year.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Got it. Great. That's terrific and then one more substantive question and any change in behaviour from you'll call it non-traditional customers like cable that might be worth calling out that would suggest, either they're more likely or less likely to be a meaningful customer in coming years.
Jeffrey Stoops: No real change, Nick. No real change that comes to mind.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Phil Cusick: Hey guys. Thanks. just to go back to the US for a second, can you tell us, is there sort of flat and running steady from here, or is there sort of an acceleration happening in that one? Just trying to get an idea of what's driving the back half strength and the durability there. Jeff, it was interesting you mentioned, continuing strength in '23 and maybe '24. So anything you can add to us there? And then second what's driving the service revenue growth and anything you can sort of help us on there if it's shifting at the margin. Thanks very much.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, the services revenue is pretty straightforward. It's just more activity, more stuff going and our services business is almost entirely gained gleaned from our own towers. So it's just a lot of activity, Phil. And in terms of the -- remember we report those growth rates on a trailing 12 month basis. So a lot of what you're going to see in our financial reports for the second or the third and the fourth quarter, we already know, it's already kind of on the books. So, that part of it there's much less risk, so to speak than those and as we move through the year as a calendar year company, the risk drops and drops and drops. So here we are in August, our year isn't entirely baked yet, but it's pretty close. Yeah. And so to your question on dish being a part of it, they're certainly a part of it because they've been a big part of our leasing activity success over the last really last year. And so the timing of when those leases commence is a driver. And so it's certainly a contributing factor to the increasing growth that we expect in Q3 and Q4.
Phil Cusick: Yep. Jeff, Jeff, you sort of cautioned us from taking that fourth quarter exit run rate from this year and extrapolating that onto next year each quarter. Do you think that that's starting to look more reasonable as you get closer to 23?
Jeffrey Stoops: I think I'd like to save all that till my 2023 guidance Phil.
Operator: Next. We'll go to line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: I have one follow up and one other question. The follow up is just on the last question on services, any color you can share, just in terms of the breadth of carrier contributions across the big four in terms of what's driving the upside on services. And then just, secondly, in terms of the edge strategy, any thoughts, updates in terms of how you're thinking about it, many difference in terms of how you're thinking about the relative to any use cases internationally? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well internationally, recall and we talked about this last quarter, the data center we bought in Brazil. We are having more advanced discussions there around CRAN  and other carrier deployments that, we'll tie into owning a data center and data center expertise. So that's encouraging, but in terms of the edge itself, we're adding couple three, four, five, maybe as many as 10 new many facilities a quarter, but it's still we're not yet prepared to say the edge is here and it's at the tower site. It's all going in the right direction, but it still needs more time, certainly is still a ways off from being material. Now in terms of the services contributions, I believe in our 10-Q we disclose who our top services customers are. So I will accelerate that for you that, and it is T-Mobile, Verizon and Dish are going to be the top three, right. Brendan. Yeah, for this quarter Tmobile, certainly the number one. Yeah. Yeah.
Matt Niknam: Great. All right, appreciate it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Next we'll go to line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: I wanted to check real quick. You mentioned the 2.5 gigahertz auction that's going on right now. Generally most people think T-Mobile will be the only meaningful bidder there, but just wondering if you have any thoughts and kind of service overlap with some of the -- some of the licenses that are up for auction. And whether you think that can maybe be a meaningful contributor for you looking out the next year or two?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, a number of folks in addition to T-Mobile registered, I would agree with you only based on what I read, most folks expect T-Mobile to be the big winner and any kind of spectrum for us is new spectrum is going to prove valuable in one degree or another. Now, if it's folks who don't have existing 2.5 gigahertz spectrum to deploy, that's going to generally mean new radios and antennas. So that can be a little more impactful than not, but just having more spectrum and greater densification that will permit is a good thing. So, I'm not really going to speculate as to who else is going to put in bids that ultimately win the day. We're just happy that there's another auction, a very valuable mid band spectrum that we know ultimately gets deployed.
Eric Luebchow: Fair enough, and just related to T-Mobile seems like they've been running at a pretty fast pace but based on what they've said, it sounds like they'll be mostly done with their 2.5 and 600 overlays at some point, maybe by mid next year. So wondering if you see any sign that they could moderate activity, or do you think maybe there's still some opportunity, especially with the C-band licenses and the 3.45 that they've get to deploy?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, I think there'll be opportunities. And I think when all of our customers talk about when this spectrum gets deployed, they they're generally talking about coverage and that's just really, the end of coverage is the beginning of densification and all the infill and other things that will ultimately be driven by consumer uptake of 5G apps and products. So when we think about these periods of additional investment, they have always in our history gone well beyond the dates that folks talk about achieving their pops, their desired pops coverage, because then you just -- then it gets to densification, which is much different.
Operator: Next we'll go to line of David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Thanks. Just a quick one from me on the financing market. Did you guys mention how you're planning on funding the GTS transaction, and maybe for Brendan, if you could just comment on the relative attractiveness of a secured versus the unsecured markets today?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. On GTS, as of right now, we plan to be opportunistic in the financing markets. That financing, we haven't been specific about that. We do have the capacity on our revolver and with the cash that we're generating from operations to handle it if necessary, but we do intend to be opportunistic. We do have a maturity. Our next step maturity actually comes up in March of next year and so that will be refinanced at some point between now and then, and there's capacity within our ABS structure to actually raise more money. So that might be a contributor. So we'll see how that goes. In the general sense of secured versus unsecured, I don't think they're obviously all up right now in terms of pricing. For us there's still availability and any of the markets that we typically use. So it's not a question of access, it's really just a question of pricing and so we intend to be take our time and be opportunistic. And as was mentioned in the script, we have other than this one maturity that I mentioned, which represents about 5% of our outstanding debt. We don't have any maturities for over two years. So we have the flexibility to be a little bit patient with that. But, I think you should expect we'll continue to use the secured markets as we have in the past. But a mix of both will likely be the path for us.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah. And while we may be opportunistic David and raise the money, from somewhere else for purposes of our outlook, it assumes cash on hand and a revolver draw.
Operator: Next we'll go to line of Greg Williams with Cowen. Please. Go ahead.
Greg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First one's just on the mix of colo versus amendments. I think you noted you're at elevated levels, like a third of the US, this new colo and two thirds amendments and I think International's a 51-49 split. Curious to hear your thoughts on where that could go from here. We had sort of pish-ish levels. Jeff, you mentioned we're going to go from coverage to densification. I would imagine that you'd see more amendments that way. So curious to hear your thoughts there. Second questions just on the service margin. If you are seeing this five quarters in a row record and you're going to more of a construction phase, would that mean the service margin could decline a bit as you shift away from like playing and designing towards construction? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, the short answer to your last question is yes. So that could vary very well happen and I'm sorry, what was color versus amendments and the mix in terms of a shift, if you kind of go back really the colo side of it in the US is heavily driven by Dish. And so as you have a little less dish contribution, you see the percentage shifting more towards amendments and I think with that, and the mix towards infill, as we talked about amendments will probably be trending higher as a percentage.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. When you think about how this is going to go, and there'll be exceptions of course to this, but for the most part, the rollouts by T-Mobilem, Verizon and AT&T are going to be heavily amendment. For Dish it's going to be more colo. And then when we get to the densification part, Greg, you kind of lean towards amendment, but I believe that you will see I think a higher percentage of brand new leases when we get to the deification stage.
Operator:  And at this time there's no one in queue.
Jeffrey Stoops: Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us. We had a great quarter and we look forward to our next report. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by. And welcome to the SBA First Quarter Results for 2022 Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, everyone. And thank you for joining us for SBA's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2022 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 25, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our first quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh : Thanks, Mark. Good evening. SBA started the year off with a very strong quarter with many of the results ahead of our internal expectations, and we continue to anticipate a solid performance throughout 2022.  Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $559.4 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $551.4 million. Foreign exchange rates were slightly ahead of our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, positively impacting revenues by approximately $2.3 million. They were also a tailwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2021, positively impacting revenues by $2.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.3% over the first quarter of 2021, including the impact of 3.1% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 7.4%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 6.4% on a gross basis and 3.7% on a net basis, including 2.7% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was very strong again and materially higher than the first quarter of last year. And we continue to replenish our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog, which remained very healthy at quarter end. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the rest of 2022.  During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 55% of our domestic bookings, with 45% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7% net, including 4.8% of churn or 11.8% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again. And we continue to see increasing customer activity levels in many of our markets. International growth continued to climb higher, in part due to increased inflation of -- I'm sorry, in part due to increased inflation-based escalators.  In Brazil, our largest international market, we also had another solid quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.3% on a constant currency basis. During the first quarter, 82.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.  Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $445.3 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.6% and an international tower cash flow margin of 68% or 90.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. International tower margins were modestly impacted by our new, less mature Tanzania assets. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $423.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.2%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter.  During the first quarter, our services business produced record results for the fourth quarter in a row with $60.3 million in revenue and $14.6 million of segment operating profit. We also continue to replenish and build even higher our services backlog, finishing the quarter at the highest level in our company's history. Based on this backlog and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for increased contributions from our services business throughout the balance of 2022. AFFO in the first quarter was $324.3 million. AFFO per share was $2.96, an increase of 14.7% over the first quarter of 2021. During the first quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 1,807 communication sites for total cash consideration of $215.4 million, which includes 1,445 sites for $176.1 million closed on January 4 and our previously disclosed acquisition from Airtel Tanzania.  We also built 86 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 358 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $127.9 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the acquisition of a stand-alone datacenter in Sao Paulo, Brazil for cash consideration of approximately $49 million. The datacenter currently produces approximately $8.3 million in annual revenue and $3.5 million in annual adjusted EBITDA. This acquisition was done in support of our continuing evaluation and efforts around the potential expansion of mobile edge computing to our tower sites. In addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $8.7 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now. This afternoon's earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook for most of our key metrics from the outlook we previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. These increases are partially due to revised expectations for better foreign currency exchange rates than previously assumed. These FX changes have contributed an increase to our revenue outlook of approximately $21 million and our adjusted EBITDA outlook of approximately $13 million.  In addition, we have increased the midpoint of our outlook for site leasing revenue by $17 million on a constant currency basis. This increase is due to several factors, including lower domestic churn impact during 2022 as a result of longer decommissioning cycles as compared to SBA's initial estimates, higher international CPI-based escalators, higher reimbursable and miscellaneous onetime revenue items and contributions from acquisitions completed during and after the quarter, all of which was partially offset by increased churn in Panama. On April 6, Digicel Panama, one of our primary customers in Panama, announced that they intend to apply for voluntary liquidation and withdraw from the telecommunications market in Panama. While there are likely many developments and steps to take place over the coming months, we have increased our projected 2022 churn impact by approximately $6 million to account for the loss of all leasing revenue from Digicel Panama for the balance of the year.  Notwithstanding this one churn issue, as noted, there were a number of very positive developments in our business over the last two months that have resulted in a significant increase in our full year revenue outlook. In addition to the leasing benefits I just mentioned, we also raised the midpoint of our services revenue outlook by $27 million or over 13% due to our very strong first quarter results and the continuing strength of our backlogs. The strength of both our leasing and services business has allowed us to raise the midpoint of our full year outlook for AFFO per share by $0.24.  Our full year 2022 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today, and the outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the rest of the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO do not contemplate any further financing activity in 2022. However, we will continue to look for opportunities to continue to optimize our balance sheet. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion of total debt and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times, well within our target, notwithstanding a substantial amount of capital allocated in the first quarter. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.3 times, the highest in the company's history.  As of the end of the quarter, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt was 2.6% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.6 years, and the interest rate on 92% of our outstanding debt is fixed. As of today, we have $590 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $431.6 million at an average price per share of $332. Included in these amounts, subsequent to our previous disclosure of share buybacks in our fourth quarter earnings release, is the repurchasing of 253,000 shares for $81.6 million at an average price per share of $322.10. All the shares repurchased were retired. We currently have $504.7 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2022, were 107.8 million, compared to 109.3 million at March 31, 2021, a reduction of 1.4%.  In addition, during the first quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.9 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.71 per share, which is an increase of 22.4% over the second quarter of last year. It's payable on June 14, 2022, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 19, 2022. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops : Thanks, Mark. And good evening, everyone. As you have heard, we had a very strong start to the year with strong operating and financial results, again generating double-digit percentage growth in AFFO per share. Our better-than-expected results combined with continued elevated activity levels with our customers have set us up well for the balance of this year. We have increased our outlook for full year revenues by $65 million and AFFO per share by $0.24. These upward revisions are indicative of the positive environment we are currently in.  The U.S. market remains particularly strong. Each of our U.S. carrier customers remained busy during the quarter, signing up new leases and amendments and generally investing in the build-out of their networks through the deployment of new spectrum bands. T-Mobile continued their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon and AT&T increased their 5G-related signings with us, with particular focus on C-band-oriented deployments. And DISH continued signing up new lease agreements actively in support of their nationwide 5G network build-out. These carrier activity levels also drove meaningful U.S. services results where we produced record services revenue and margin results for the fourth quarter in a row. Our backlogs also continue to replenish and support our confidence in continued strong performance. Internationally, we had another strong quarter, finishing ahead of our internal expectations for organic tower leasing and new build activity in most of our markets. During the first quarter, we signed up 49% of new international revenue through new leases and 51% through amendments to existing leases. Coupled with increased escalators due to higher consumer price indexes in many of our markets, this leasing activity drove some of our strongest organic international leasing revenue growth in years.  We are also off to a good start integrating our new Tanzanian operations, and we continue to build new sites and tower backlogs in the Philippines. In addition, we recently acquired a new datacenter in Sao Paulo that we believe will allow us to more fully explore the potential for tower edge mobile computing in Brazil. We believe this datacenter can act as a hub for tower edge datacenters and C-RAN deployments based on discussions with some of our carrier customers in Brazil. Overall, internationally, we have a lot of very exciting things happening, and we continue to believe that 2022 will be a very good year. In addition to our strong operational performance during the first quarter, we also continued to execute well with regard to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We meaningfully increased our dividend and invested in significant asset additions as well as significant stock repurchases. We were able to make these investments while maintaining our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage at 7.3 times, right in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5 times, and our weighted average cost of debt remains largely fixed and at our all-time low of 2.6%.  We believe our ability to manage leverage while continuing to invest in our business is critical during this current time of more broadly increasing interest rates. We are well positioned to continue to grow our business, but also to weather any kind of challenging macro environment. We are very pleased with our start to 2022. I'm going to keep my comments brief as I believe our results and increased outlook tell the story very well. I believe the rest of the year will be similar to the first quarter, excellent blocking and tackling on our part against a very strong demand environment. We are in a great industry during a time of increasing organic growth, and we are more financially healthy than at any time in our history. We have great confidence in the balance of the year and look forward to helping our customers achieve their ambitious network goals. I want to finish by again thanking our team members for their commitment and contributions to our success.  And with that, Colin, we are now ready for questions.
Q - Amir Razban : Hi. This is Amir for Phil. Two, if I may. So you guys mentioned lower expectations for churn this year. You reconsidered the timing of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger revenues falling off. Can you give us an update on maybe how your expectations for long-term churn with them have changed?  And then secondly, is the datacenter acquisition within guidance? And does this kind of indicate SBAC is leaning more into the mobile edge compute opportunity? Thank you. 
Brendan Cavanagh : Just, Amir, on the churn question, we don't have any real changes to our long-term expectations. What you're seeing is a slight shift in timing. So a little bit less of an expectation in this year, but ultimately, those incremental dollars would just move to next year. So what we've given out in the past in terms of expectations each year is generally the same as it's been before.
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah. On the datacenter question, I think it's really no change in our activity, trajectory and direction around mobile edge that we've been talking about now for, I guess, at least a year. I would look at this as an extension of what we're doing in the U.S. to our largest international market, Brazil. And we think it will continue our learning and interactions with our customers.  And I would say so far that the results are encouraging, and we continue to believe that we will be benefited and that the mobile edge will in fact have value created or create value at our tower sites. And we think these datacenter investments, albeit modest, are going to help us get there.
Brendan Cavanagh : And it is in guidance, too, the datacenter.
Amir Razban : Okay. Great. And one more, if I could. How prepared do you think you are versus like an AMT that has that CoreSite asset for them? Do you -- how do you kind of view that?
Jeffrey Stoops : Well, prepared for what? I mean I think it all -- it all remains to be seen how robust the edge at the tower site business. And that's what we're focused on. So from that perspective, I think our measured approach is the right one for us.
Amir Razban : Great. Thank you. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery : Great. Good afternoon. Jeff, thanks for all the comments. Great to hear the momentum in the business. I wonder if you could talk about the sustainability of this. We've heard from both Verizon and T-Mobile that CapEx peaks this year and then falls fairly sharply. And how do you think about your medium-term outlook given some of those commentary? And perhaps relatedly, we've seen very strong fixed wireless results. How do you think that might impact some of their builds, some of their densification over the coming years? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah. I think it is going to be a multiyear endeavor, Simon, particularly keeping in mind that the C-band clears in phases over years. So there's really going to be multiple years still ahead where C-band deployments are going to have to take place. I take our customers' comments at face value.  I can tell you, though, that there's a lot of work to be done. And at least on the C-band deployment side of things, they are just in their infancy. It can only be a multiyear endeavor. So I'm not sure how that will be impacted, if at all, by the fixed wireless initiative and the spend there. It's really -- obviously, one is primarily a mobility product, and the other is a location-driven product, but I don't -- we've not seen any signs that the success in the fixed wireless area is going to impact the mobility spend.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Rick Prentiss : Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Hey, I want to follow up on some of the comments about the international churn. You mentioned you called out the Digicel Panama. How much of that should roll into next year, though, if you say that's the impact for the rest of this year? How much should we think about that kind of tail hitting us next year? And update us as far as what's going on with Oi.  We've seen obviously a lot of press releases. It looks like some transactions are finally coming to pass in Brazil.
Brendan Cavanagh : Yeah. So the $6 million of incremental churn for Digital represents about three quarters. So there'll be another couple of million dollars into next year. There's probably also a little bit of additional, Rick, because we were already assuming some digital churn previously, not associated with this liquidation, just as they were shutting down certain sites because they were obviously already having some issues. So there's probably an extra $1 million or so in addition that would flow into next year.
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah. On the Oi situation, Rick, the sale has closed. Oi Mobility. Wireless has been sold in parts to Claro, TIM and Vivo. They've all got some cell sites. They've all got some subscribers. Only Tim and Vivo got spectrum, however, because Claro was already at their regulatory prescribed limits.  And where it all stands right now is that each of the recipients or winning bidders or the three remaining need to prepare and file with the regulators various plans and answers to some conditions and restrictions that were put on the approvals. That has not happened yet. We'll be watching with great interest what those filings will be. But also keep in mind now we have the 5G auctions done in Brazil and the spectrum ready to be released and with some time limits on deployment at least around the major capital cities.
Rick Prentiss : Okay. And you also -- obviously, CPI is benefiting escalators. How should we think about how often they get updated? What's -- where are we at in the process of you guys? Maybe also just update on where you're seeing CPI in Brazil and South Africa. But just help us understand the time line as far as where the benefit and escalator is at currently where it might head? And also, is there anything on the cost side?
Brendan Cavanagh : The CPI in Brazil right now for us -- for our average for the year went to about 9%. The actual rate is higher than that. It's closer to 11%, I believe, right now. And the timing is really tied to when the leases individually escalate. There are some larger concentrations because of some of the acquisitions that we did. Those tend to be in the fourth quarter and the second quarter. But really, it's just a function of the time that the anniversary date of each individual lease and what the CPI looks like on a year-over-year basis at that point in time. 
Jeffrey Stoops : Keep in mind on the expense side, Rick, the ground leases, which are the single largest component in Brazil, are a pass-through item. So we have that protection. Where we are likely to see the impact is, of course, on the labor side. And we will see that because of the way the Brazilian employment laws are written. But again, I would point out that, given the operating leverage in the business, the percentage of employee costs against revenue is extremely small. So we have some great elasticity to be able to absorb any employee-related CPI increases.
Rick Prentiss : Make sense. Thanks for that. Have a good day. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.
David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking questions. I guess first one maybe for you, Brendan or Mark. With respect to the guidance expectations for rate movements, for the rest of the year and the impact on the net change in the updated '22 guide, could you kind of give us a sense as to what you were originally baking in and what maybe is net incremental probably a headwind presumably on the 8% remaining variable rate debt. And then the second piece would be just on the service revenue kind of outlook. Obviously, pretty healthy activity across the board. We've talked in the past about the margin mix, whether it's earlier stage, it's more human capital, higher margin, later stage is more labor-related and lower margin. Where are we in that curve? And where do you see margins in that business going?
Brendan Cavanagh : Yeah. On the rate impacts, the impact is primarily due to: one, an assumed increase in CPI rates; and two, slightly more of our revolver being drawn during the course of the year associated with some of the incremental spend that we've just incurred or have under contract. So if you look at our CapEx guidance, it's up a little bit so that, that requires that along with the share repurchases that we did that weren't assumed before that we have a little bit more capital drawn and because it's floating rate and the CPI is increasing. That's really driving the increase in our net cash interest expense guidance that we gave. Otherwise, there's really no changes to that.
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah. On the services, Dave, the biggest issue is not so much the margin inside each of our two services segments. It's really the mix of the two. Site acquisition has historically been the higher-margin business. Construction has been a lower-margin business. I will tell you, though, that the margins that we're currently experiencing in both segments relative to our history are very good, maybe pushing all-time highs. But really, the biggest driver of where margins come out, it's the mix between site acquisition and construction services, although we -- again, we're very, very happy with where each of those segments are performing. One of the ramifications of a big services quarter, though, given the fact that it is a lower-margin business, is its impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin. So for those of you who are wondering why that is where it is this quarter, it's really because of the large amount of services revenue that we booked this quarter.
David Barden : Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks, Jeff. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. 
Nick Del Deo : Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. First, kind of turning back to Brazil and the Oi situation, can you talk at all about the conversations you've had with customers? And anything they've said about their plans to invest behind the assets they're acquiring? And are any of the initial goals that they've laid out for site decommissionings, I think at least TIM has talked about that, have those been consistent with your expectations?
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah. I think we're still of the same mind in terms of the aggregate exposure, which -- Mark, jump in here and make sure I say the right numbers.
Mark DeRussy: $20 million to $30 million over the life is what we think our exposure is.
Jeffrey Stoops : Yes. So nothing's really changed there, Nick. As what we have seen in the U.S. that to actually migrate customers and truly decommission sites, it's a little more complex. It takes a little more time than people think. Now that's really a timing comment. We don't -- we think the ultimate numbers will be what Brendan just said. But we really don't have any specific instructions from them as of this point. We do expect that, as the year progresses, we will begin to get more clarity on the timing and final amount that we will be looking at.  But they are -- on the other side, the 3 now nationwide carriers are all active to varying degrees with the new spectrum deployments.
Nick Del Deo : Okay, okay. That's great. And then maybe turning to the datacenter topic. I think, to date, you've described what you're doing is buying assets to learn about the business, learn about the edge opportunity. Do you feel like you currently own a sufficient number of datacenters in the U.S. to fulfill that goal? Or should we expect you to pick up some more in the future maybe in different geographies or different size or something like that?
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah. I think, as our experimentation and learning process continues to move in a positive direction, it would not be impossible to see us buy a couple more datacenters, but I don't think we would ever get to the point where you would see -- I mean it won't ever get close to 1% of enterprise value, I don't believe.
Nick Del Deo : Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you, Jeff. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. First question for me was, curious if you could unpack the merger churn in the U.S. from Sprint and T-Mobile that was within the first quarter results as well as what's in the guidance for 2022.
Brendan Cavanagh : Yeah. What's in the guidance for 2022 is now approximately $27 million. I think we had previously told you $30 million. Obviously, we lowered our full year number by $3 million. The first quarter piece of that, I don't know -- let me check that and get back to you, and I'll mention on the call if we are done with you before then.
Michael Rollins : Sure. And then just as you're thinking about the year domestically. Just curious how you're thinking about that 3.7% net growth that you did in 1Q relative to the full year guide. If I'm calculating the numbers right on Slide 4, I think it is, it also looks like for the full year organically you're looking for about that amount, but with churn possibly ramping higher as a contribution.  So just kind of curious how you're thinking about the growth moving through the year and the net and what the contribution that may be layered in for DISH and AT&T as you're just thinking about that full year growth expectation for 2022.
Jeffrey Stoops : Well, I know, Brendan, you could get to the net, but I know that the gross number, Mike, we expect to grow sequentially as we move through the year.
Brendan Cavanagh : Yeah. We do expect the growth to move up sequentially. We also expect the churn node to move up sequentially during the year. Obviously, as indicated by the first quarter shift here, there's some potential that our expectations around timing are off on the churn, but our expectation and what's in our guidance shows that it's increasing. So the net will be a modest increase, maybe flat to modest increase quarter-over-quarter going through the year. In terms of the mix, I don't think we want to get into the individual carriers that make up the mix. I think we've been pretty clear in the past that on a lot of -- the last few quarters, a lot of the lease-up, one of the significant contributors there was DISH in terms of their new agreements. So obviously, they would be a nice component of that growth, but all the carriers have contributed to the lease-up activity. So they're all in the mix.
Michael Rollins : And how does the -- when we think about the longer-term leverage targets for the business, do you have a rule of thumb in terms of rates to a certain level and leverage to be a certain level? Or is your view of leverage less dependent on the rate environment within  
Jeffrey Stoops : Well, clearly, there would be a rate level which would -- and I -- and I don't really want to get pinned down on what that is. But clearly, there would be a rate at which we would look at different leverage levels.  But beyond that, Mike, what we're looking at is our dividend, our dividend payout ratio, how much our EBITDA growth looks to be. So I mean we really do try and be very thoughtful and take into account everything that should be taken into account.  But I mean on an absolute basis, of course, there would be some interest rate that if we thought it was going to be maintained and sustained for long periods of time, if it were materially higher than where we are today, will cause us to revisit our leverage targets.
Brendan Cavanagh : And Mike, before you go, let me follow back up on your question about how much Sprint in the first quarter. It was approximately $4 million of impact in the quarter, so a little over 1% of the roughly 2.7%.
Michael Rollins : Thanks very much. 
Operator: And next, we go to the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.
Sami Badri : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to get a little bit of an update on the MLAs. And I think what we'd all kind of could really use maybe a little bit more color on how much activity is falling into those MLAs versus out of those MLAs with the same customers that actually sign them. Can you just give us a little bit of color or more color than normal on what the mix of in versus out of MLA looks like?
Jeffrey Stoops : Well, I think it's 100% for every customer that we have an MLA with is somehow touched by the MLA. So that's DISH, Verizon and T-Mobile. And then we don't have one with AT&T. It's not really a situation where some of it's covered and some of it's not per carrier.
Sami Badri : Got it. And --
Jeffrey Stoops : And just to be clear, our MLAs, though, are still based on specific activity from those customers and equipment specificity. They're not just a broad open-ended thing.
Sami Badri : Got it. The other thing is, last quarter, you stated that the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum would require incremental radios to C-band. Do you still hold that view?
Jeffrey Stoops : We do. Although I know that they're working on an integrated one as well, which will come out at some point.
Sami Badri : Got it. And then just to be clear, right, just the -- if they do work on an integrated radio, that does still have scope for amendment because they're riding on two separate different spectrum bands? Or is there a different type of negotiation now take place if they came out with that?
Jeffrey Stoops : Well, it will be primarily driven by what the equipment looks like and how it stacks up compared to: a, if anything is coming off, that's a swap. If it's not, then we would look at the equipment and price it accordingly based on height, weight, wind load.
Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you for the color. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Greg Williams with Cowen.
Greg Williams : What multiples look like, given the rising rate environment, private multiples and the geopolitical landscape by region generally? Second question just on the record service revenues. Are you seeing any labor or logistic bottlenecks in the current environment and keeping up with this record activity?
Brendan Cavanagh : Greg, I think we missed your first question. You didn't -- you were -- the first part of that cut off.
Greg Williams : Sorry. The M&A landscape, what multiples are looking like through the regions?
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah, they're not increasing. So that's -- we're thankful for that. There are some signs that the current interest rate environment is going to have a depressive effect on prices. As you know, Greg, it takes a while for current market conditions to factor through to private market sellers. However, it is headed in that direction where, obviously, rates should and I think will impact price over time.  On the supply side of equipment and labor, I don't want to jinx things, but as of today, we are not seeing any material impact on either the supply chain side or the labor side for our business.
Greg Williams : Thank you. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.
Brett Feldman : Great. Thanks for the questions. Jeff, for the vast majority of SBA's history is a U.S. tower operator. Your fixed escalators, which are generally, I think, in the low 3% range have exceeded inflation. And that's obviously not the circumstances were today and who knows what the long-term view is going to be. But I'm wondering if we've been in an inflationary environment long enough for you to see any impact on your business or maybe to change how you think about it.  So just as an example, I'm wondering, is there any increased mutual interest between you and your carrier customers maybe finally moving to a CPI-based escalator model in your leases. If you are doing build-to-suits in this environment, are you actually still doing that at the historical escalator? Or is that changing?  And maybe just bigger picture, if we're not likely to see a change in the escalation model and we do remain in an inflationary environment, could that suggest that you may have a preference for continuing to invest increasingly outside the U.S. where you can actually develop and acquire towers that can escalate in line with CPI? Thank you. 
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah. I think I'd characterize the state of the escalator issue with our customers, Brett, as one where I think certainty and a fixed number benefits both sides. Even though, clearly, in a year like this, with a fixed escalator, one party wins, the other loses, but that's a very temporary kind of condition. And over time, the Fed has a mandate to reduce inflation back to 2% or less.  So I really don't know that there's a lot of appetite on either side to change that around really because if you have a very, very big inflation year, the person on the CPI end of that, whether it's us on ground leases or our customers on the tenant leases, they're not going to be happy. So I think we're pretty satisfied with the state of the world as it currently exists. And I don't think -- we consciously are making international decisions relative to U.S. decisions with any kind of belief that this will be better because we get CPI escalators. The traditional economic theory is if there's higher inflation in those markets, the currency is going to trade off.  So we don't really think that, that is a reason why to favor international over the U.S. The reason we go internationally is because we have a capital allocation and a target leverage, which we think is one of our principal creators of shareholder value, and we have been able to find enough to do in the U.S. And we found some very, very good things to do internationally, and I think that will continue to be the primary motivation.
Brett Feldman : If I could ask just 1 quick follow-up question. I believe in the U.S., what we've typically believed in the U.S. is that the escalation clauses on your ground rent was reasonably similar to what you see on the tower side, so kind of a fixed low 3% escalator. Is that the right understanding? Or could we see a mismatch at any point over the coming quarters?
Jeffrey Stoops : No, no. We've generally matched off -- when I say generally, I mean we've -- substantially, every single U.S. tower that is ground leased has a fixed escalator. And they typically average less than our average tenant escalator. So we feel -- and of course, you know that's our single largest source of expense and getting to the tower cash flow line is the ground leases. So we feel pretty well protected there, Brett.
Brett Feldman : Thanks. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed.
Walter Piecyk : Hey, Jeff, this first question, I'm going to send over to Brendan. You said to a prior question that Sprint churn was $4 million. Maybe if you were rounding up there, that implies, I think, a churn rate for the rest of your domestic business that I couldn't find that low, unless I went back, I guess, for a quarter or two in 2018 when it was like 1.7-1.5 for second quarter. Is this a sustainable number? Because that's just much lower than we've seen for several years.
Brendan Cavanagh : No, I don't -- I mean I think it's -- so that what's left is about 1.5, maybe 1.6% if you exclude the Sprint piece. And I don't think that's lower. I mean we've actually been -- we've been much lower than that. If you go back a couple of years ago where we were below 1%, but we've historically been somewhere in that usually between 1% and 2%, sometimes lower. So I don't think it's abnormal.
Mark DeRussy: Well, it's Mark. The absolute dollars, the numerator in that calculation, has been flat for a couple of quarters now, which is -- as a percentage is going down.
Walter Piecyk : Got you. But --
Jeffrey Stoops : I think there's a different reason. I think, Walt, what you're looking at is kind of the gross churn that historically includes -- has always included some kind of consolidation churn.
Brendan Cavanagh : Yeah. Maybe that's -- obviously, we've had Metro Leap and Clearwire. We had iDEN-related churns.
Walter Piecyk : I'm saying, like if you look at all these years passed, you've always had something setting in there. Maybe you're like actual core, core stuff, which you don't really report, was that low. But as far as reportable churn numbers, it's never been that low that I can say. Because you don't break -- you haven't broken out --
Jeffrey Stoops : Apples to apples, you have to include the Sprint.
Walter Piecyk : I mean that's -- so that was my second question, which is $4 million is fine. But if you look at $30 million for the year, you still have to step that Sprint component up pretty at some point. Like is it -- was part of this just the delay in turning off CDMA? Which quarter do you think you're really going to see? I mean, obviously, I think last year you were doing like two a quarter, somewhere in that ballpark. So four is not like it's no step-up, but are you expecting a larger step-up in Q2 or Q3, do you think?
Brendan Cavanagh : We're expecting a larger step up as we move throughout the year. So I mean, just incrementally, I think stepping up because it just builds over time. But it's really dependent on when those leases turn down, termination dates and everything else. 
Jeffrey Stoops : And it's quite possible that you see it increase each succeeding quarter.
Walter Piecyk : Okay. And then just same basic question for amendments in colo. You think the target is whatever 60 something for the year, 65%, I think. That would imply a much bigger step-up sequentially than maybe what we saw in first quarter. Any sense on kind of when you're going to see a more material step-up from quarter-to-quarter? Or do you think it's going to be somewhat linear from here?
Brendan Cavanagh : Yeah. No, it's going to step up, but I think mostly in the second half of the year. There'll be a modest step-up is our expectation next quarter and then more material into the third and then even further into the fourth quarter.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of David Guarino with Green Street.
David Guarino : Hey. Jeff, going back to the M&A conversation, you mentioned multiples aren't increasing, but I think it's fair to say that they're rich today. And we've seen some deal terms on a few recent transactions that really appear to benefit the MNO sellers. So I was just wondering if you could help us understand how are you guys competing for deals now that your peers are bidding more aggressively. And has that caused you to adjust your underwriting at all?
Brendan Cavanagh : No. We don't adjust our underwriting. We may do fewer deals, David. But if you look at the history of what we've done, we like what we've done, and we'll continue to exercise the same discipline.  And I think when you -- if you really understand what we're about, it's about creating value for our shareholders. There aren't particularly great as we see them strategic benefits of just being big in a bunch of different countries. We are much more interested in the financial characteristics and investment goals of each and every transaction. And we lose a lot, but we get enough to generally satisfy our 5% to 10% portfolio growth goals. And we're going to continue to operate that way.
David Guarino : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe switching gears on the '22 guide. I was wondering is there any conservatism in your exchange rate forecasting for the Brazilian real? It looks like your full year guidance is below where the current exchange rate is, and we've got eight months left in the year. So I just wanted to know, how do you guys think about forecasting exchange rates?
Brendan Cavanagh : We typically will use whatever the forwards are that you would generally pull from Bloomberg, some sort of average of a number of institutions that published projections. The one thing I can assure you of, David, is that we will be wrong on what we assume. I don't know whether we'll be wrong to the positive or the negative, but it's very hard to nail down. So we use what the experts are saying at any given time. But even since we kind of put our numbers together, which is at the end of last week, just in the last 2 days, we've seen the currency weakened relative to the dollar. So it's a little bit closer. So you -- basically, if you look at Brazil, our average for the balance of the year that we've assumed is essentially 5:1. And I think today, it ended up 4 88 or something like that. So it's fairly close to what the spot rate is.
David Guarino : Okay. I appreciate the email, and thanks for that. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. So wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from DISH. I mean they publicly said they think they're about six months behind where they originally expected it to be. So just wondering if either the actual site construction when they hang equipment or the date certain under your contract with them would have much of an impact on your assumed leasing outlook for the year.  And then just more broadly, are you seeing their leasing concentrated in just a few markets? Or is it pretty broadly distributed across your portfolio today? Thanks. 
Jeffrey Stoops : I could tell you that the activity level is pretty broadly distributed. And we do have a construct with DISH where once the lease is signed, revenue recognition for us begins at either a construction milestone or a date certain. And it's really the -- to actually look at all that and synthesize that and turn it into guidance is a bit of an art. So there'll be some possibilities that things move around there.  But for the most part, as we move through the year, things are known with a greater degree of certainty. So there's some opportunities for some movement. But for the most part, we feel pretty, pretty good about DISH's contribution. In terms of your comment about them being behind by six-- I mean maybe that's their own internal goals and projections, but I would repeat what we've said now for, I think, the better part of the year, which is they're very active, actually busier with us than we thought they would be for a rolling 12-month period. And they continue to be very, very busy and driving hard towards satisfying their June 2023 regulatory obligations.
Eric Luebchow : Great. Appreciate the color. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brandon Nispel : Okay. Great. Thank you for taking questions. Maybe two, one follow-up though. Could you share what the backlog of lease applications was? What was that up this quarter? And if we just held that flat looking at the comparables in sort of the second and third quarter, what would that growth rate look like?  Then secondly, following up on Walt's question, it looks like you had about $12.6 million in U.S. organic growth this quarter on that 6.4%. Do you still think you can get to a low $20 million number exiting this year? And then is that a reasonable number to run rate into 2023? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh : Okay. On the backlog question, just to be clear on how we evaluate backlog for our leasing business, we're looking at the number of applications for new leases and amendments. Obviously, the pricing may vary depending on exactly what they do and sometimes that pricing has to be negotiated.  So it's not necessarily dollar-based. So I think I can't -- the number of applications is up. So when we say it's up, that's what we're referring to. So I can't really give you a -- what would the lease-up be if it were the same for the last few quarters. On the leasing dollars question in the fourth quarter, we do think we can get to the low-20s by the end of the year. As to whether that would be a run rate going forward is partially dependent on activity levels for the balance of this year, which we think will remain fairly strong. But as of today, I can't comment on what next year's number will be.
Brandon Nispel : Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Matt Niknam : Just two quick ones, if I could. First, on M&A. I know you mentioned, I think, 358 sites acquired are under contract as of the end of the quarter. Any color you can share in terms of where they're located and when they're expected to close?  And then secondly, on the dividend payout ratio, I know you mentioned in the release that you're still under 25%. And I know you've talked about 20% annual growth the next several years. Any sort of update in terms of where you'd like to get that payout ratio to over time? Thanks. 
Jeffrey Stoops : Well, we like it low because it gives us plenty of opportunities, including stock repurchases, which we think -- I think the execution and the allocation that we have, including setting the dividend really has served our shareholders well. So -- but at the same time, Matt, we want to continue to be an industry leader in terms of our dividend growth rates, which is why we set things to start at a low level.  So really, it's kind of the balance of those two which will ultimately drive where we set the dividend going forward, but I think you would agree at 25 -- less than a 25% payout ratio, we have a lot of room to increase the dividend materially in the years ahead. What was your first question?
Brendan Cavanagh : M&A under contract mix. It's largely international. There is some domestic and some international. Was there more to the question?
Matt Niknam : Any color you can share in terms of country or region, if possible?
Jeffrey Stoops : They're all existing markets.
Matt Niknam : Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. 
Operator:  And we do have a question from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC.
Jon Atkin : Was interested in talking a little bit about other types of infrastructure. You did the PG&E deal. There's rooftops, but on kind of non-conventional macro towers and opportunities you see within that segment? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah. We continue to pursue a variety of different things, Jon. We have a growing indoor DAS business. We have a growing connected venues business where we get in and actually kind of build out the telecommunications infrastructure in new developments. We have added some rooftop sites for sure. And we have picked up now three datacenters.  None of that stuff comes close to being anywhere near material compared to the basic macro tower business. And while we are seeing good return on invested capital in all these areas, and we will continue to look at them and believe that we're picking areas that will scale over time. I mean we are, for all intents and purposes, for the foreseeable future we are a macro tower company.
Jon Atkin : So alternatives like rooftops, transmission lines, utility?
Jeffrey Stoops : We're buying rooftops. We are developing rooftops. We're playing in pretty much all the areas other than fiber, outdoor small cells on a big basis and undersea cable. But none of it is -- gets to the point where it's going to occupy a material portion of our financial results in the foreseeable future.  So the question then, I guess, should be, why are you doing it? And the answer is, well, because of where we are, who we are and what we've done over the years, we do get a lot of ancillary opportunities. And these are good assets, exclusive assets that are going to produce for us a good return on invested capital and are generally pursued and occupied by folks who are otherwise engaged in the macro tower business.
Jon Atkin : Thanks very much. 
Jeffrey Stoops : Yeah. 
Operator: And we have no further lines in queue at this time.
Jeffrey Stoops : Great. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us for what you heard was a great first quarter. And we look forward to reporting continued success as we move through this year. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our teleconference call for today. Again, thank you very much for your participation and for using the AT&T Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will have a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to queue up for a question  As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark Derussy: Good evening. And thank you for joining us for SBA's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeffrey Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we we'll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2022 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Statements are as of today, February 28th, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our fourth-quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks, Mark. Good evening. SBA finished 2021 with our best quarter of the year. The quarter included financial and operating results ahead of our expectations and continued strong momentum into 2022. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $539.4 million and cash site leasing revenues were $529.8 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter. They were a headwind, though, on comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2020, negatively impacting revenues by $2.1 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4% over the fourth quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.7% of churn.  On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.7%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.3% on a gross basis and 3.9% on a net basis, including 2.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was at its highest level of the year, this was the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of executions, we continued to replenish our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog, which remained very healthy at year-end. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity represented 48% of our domestic bookings, with 52% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and DISH represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.  In the fourth quarter, reported domestic site leasing revenue was slightly impacted by the timing of revenue commencements versus our internal estimates, primarily with regard to new DISH leases. This is a timing issue only as the number of leases executed exceeded our expectations. During the quarter, we also had slightly less domestic churn than our internal estimates due to delays in timing versus our prior estimates. Internationally on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.3% net, including 4.4% of churn or 8.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity increased again and was at the highest level of the year. As anticipated, the impact of international churn increased in the quarter as we began to see greater impacts from carrier consolidations and other network and contract modifications in Central America. Although there were some churn timing delays that resulted in slightly lower reported international churn for 2021 than we previously forecasted.  In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another solid quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 9.8% on a constant currency basis. During the fourth quarter, 84.9% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.3% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 8.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $434.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remained very strong, with a fourth quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.1% or 91.6%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $409.1 million.  The adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.8% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.5%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our services business produced record results for the third quarter in a row with $55.9 million in revenue and $12.9 million of segment operating profit. Notwithstanding these record results, we were able to completely replenish our services backlogs finishing the year at an equal level to our company all-time high backlog from September 30th. Based on this backlog and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we are projecting another very strong contribution from our services business in 2022, AFFO in the fourth quarter was $310.8 million. AFFO per share was $2.81, an increase of the 13.3% over the fourth quarter of 2020 on a constant currency basis.  During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 59 communication sites for total cash consideration of $38.4 million. We also built 88 new sites in the quarter, including our first seven sites built in our new markets the Philippines. Jeff will touch on our expansion into the Philippines in a moment. Subsequent to quarter end on January fourth, we closed on our previously announced deal to acquire towers from Airtel Tanzania. This transaction added 1445 sites to our tower portfolio at a cash purchase price of a $176.1 million. And the impact of this transaction is fully included in our 2022 full year outlook. Additionally, subsequent to year-end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 371 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $137.1 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the third quarter.  In addition to new tower assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $13.6 million to buy land and easements, and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years. Looking ahead now, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2022. Our outlook reflects a significant increase in organic leasing revenue contributions from new leases and amendments. This increased organic leasing contribution is largely due to the increased pace of new leasing activity we experienced during 2021, as well as some contributions from anticipated continued strong organic leasing activity during 2022.  Our outlook for contributions from new leases and amendments is based in part on estimates of lease commencement timing with each of our customers, and shifts in the timing of equipment installations may have minor impacts on these estimates as they did in the fourth-quarter. We are also projecting increases in contributions from contractual escalations. Most of the increase is projected in our international markets, where inflationary increases are expected to drive increased rental escalations. In addition, our leasing revenue outlook contemplates increased impacts from customer churn in 2022. The primary increases in connection with anticipated Sprint related decommissioning. Our outlook incorporates a current estimate of approximately $30 million of churn in 2022 related to legacy Sprint leases. And our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint related churn over the next several years remains unchanged. Our total churn projections for 2022 are based in part on internal estimates of a variety of factors that can impact the timing of actual revenue cease dates.  To the extent that there are variances from these internal estimates, there may be impacts on our reported 2022 churn. However, any differences reported 2022 churn from these variances is a tiny issue and does not change our expectations for long-term aggregate churn. In addition to Sprint churn, our outlook includes increased churn in our international markets, primarily due to carrier consolidation in Central America. Our full-year 2022 outlook includes the projected impact of the Tanzania acquisition, but it does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today. The outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today.  However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO do not contemplate any further financing activity in 2022, however, we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and our cost of debt. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of $110 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We're very excited about 2022, our customers are all very active and we expect to produce very strong results as we help them to achieve their network build-out goals. And with that, I will now turn things back over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark Derussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt, and $12 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times. Our fourth-quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was five times -- 5.0 times, the highest in the company's history. During the fourth quarter, the company, through an existing trust, issued $895 million of 1.84% secured tower revenue securities Series 2021-2C, which have an anticipated repayment date of April 9th, 2027, and a final maturity date of October 10, 2051. In addition, $895 million of 2.593% secured tower revenue securities Series 2021-3C, which have an anticipated repayment date of October 9th, 2031, and a final maturity date of October 10, 2056. The aggregate $1.79 billion of these Tower Securities have a blended interest rate of 2.217%, and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment date of 7.8 years.  Also during the fourth quarter, the company repaid at par the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2013-2C Tower Securities, which had an anticipated repayment date of April 11th, 2023. And we also redeem the entire aggregate $1.1 billion principal amount of the 2016, 4.875% senior notes, as well as paid all premiums and costs associated with such redemption. As of the end of the year, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt was 2.6% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.8 years. And the interest rate on 97% of our outstanding debt is fixed. As of today, we have $560 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 786,000 shares of our common stock for $263.6 million at an average price per share of $335.26. Subsequent to year-end, we repurchased an additional 1.047 million shares for $350 million at an average price per share of $334.40.  Since the beginning of 2021, we have repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock at an average price of $318.59 per share. All of the shares repurchased were retired. We currently have $586.4 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 were $109 million compared to $109.8 million at December 31, 2020, a reduction of 0.8%. Pro forma for the repurchases after year-end, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7%. In addition, during the fourth quarter we declared and paid a cash dividend of $63.1 million or $0.58 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.71 per share, an increase of 22. 4% over last quarter payable on March 25, 2022, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2022. Today's dividend announcement represents a payout ratio of 25% of fourth-quarter AFFO per share. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had a very strong finish to the year, again, generating double-digit percentage growth in AFFO per share. We produced record results in several categories, and we're set up well for a very strong 2022. 2021 lease up activity levels were ahead of plan in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. market was particularly strong with the highest level of organic new leasing revenue per tower signed up in over seven years during the fourth-quarter, T-Mobile remained extremely busy investing in their continued nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. DISH continued signing up a large number of new lease agreements in support of their brand-new nationwide 5G network. Verizon continued its ramp up for their C-band deployments and AT&T remained a steady contributor.  These significant activity levels have also translated into meaningful use services results, where we produced record services, revenue and margin results for the third quarter in a row. Domestic activity has remained strong through the first two months of 2022. And both our leasing and services backlogs have remained very healthy. Not withstanding the solid fourth quarter results we produced in both segments of the business. Based on this backlog commentary from our largest U.S. customers disclosing robust capital expenditure plans for 2022 and the size and scope of our customers 5G deployment plans, we expect to continue seeing elevated domestic leasing and services activities throughout 2022 into 2023, and perhaps beyond. Internationally, we had our strongest leasing quarter of the year. Demand remains high in many of our largest international markets, and we expect to continue to see it remains strong throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, we signed up 68% of new international revenue through new leases, and 32% through amendments to existing leases. We had strong leasing results in Central America, Brazil, and South Africa.  In addition, the recent 5G spectrum auction in Brazil and the upcoming 5G spectrum auction and South Africa give us confidence that we will continue to see increasing network investment, and thus leasing demand throughout our largest international markets. We're also excited about the potential from our two newest international markets. In early January, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of over 1400 sites from Airtel Tanzania. We believe this market has great promise for us not only in terms of organic lease-up on our acquired sites, but also in terms of new tower build opportunities. Significant wireless investment will be needed over the upcoming years. And we are well-positioned to support our customers in Tanzania, and participate in the growth of wireless throughout this market. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we built our first brand-new greenfield sites in the Philippines. The Philippines is a market that we have studied for a number of years, and we're very excited about the prospects for favorable growth over the next few years. We have established operations in the market, opening a local office, hiring staff, working with the appropriate government agencies for all necessary permits, and establishing strong positive relationships with each of the three major mobile network operators in the market. We are initially and primarily focused on a greenfield new build strategy in the Philippines, and we anticipate the demand to support significant new tower build numbers for the next several years. We believe are significant long-standing tower operation expertise will provide meaningful value to our customers in this market and will give us a competitive advantage. I look forward to sharing results with you in the future as we continue to grow in the Philippines.  Overall, internationally, we have a lot of very exciting things happening, and we believe 2022 will be a very good year. Throughout the last year, we have done an excellent job with regard to our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. During the last year, we have completed a number of significant low-cost refinancings which have meaningfully improved our balance sheet positioning, particularly ahead of a period with potentially increasing interest rates. Our early refinancing of several of our outstanding debt securities during 2021 extended out maturity dates and produced the lowest weighted average interest rate in our company's history at 2.6%. The substantial majority of our interest costs has also locked in at fixed rates. We have continued to target our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage in a range of 7 to 7.5 earns, and have invested the available capital produced by that strategy into portfolio growth and share repurchases.  Since the beginning of 2021, we have grown our site portfolio by over 8%, and we have repurchased 2.9 million shares of our outstanding stock. We have also been able to continue to meaningfully increase our quarterly dividend. Today, announcing an increase in our dividend of over 22%, while still retaining over 75% of our projected AFFO for additional discretionary investment. We believe that all of these factors will be additive to AFFO per share. And as a result, shareholder value creation. I'd like to take a moment to reflect on full-year results. They were very good. Year-over-year, we grew cash site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO per share by 6.3%, 6.5%, 7.6%, and 13.9% respectively. We posted industry-leading tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins of 81.7% and 70.5%. Beyond the impressive growth rates and margins, the quality of revenue and cash flow shine through backed by predominately U.S. macro towers in our services segment, we had a banner year finishing 2021 with $205 million in revenue and $46 million in gross profit among the highest in company history.  Each quarter throughout the year, SBA posted sequentially higher results are a reflection of the tremendous activity we're seeing from our customers with little signs of slowing. We allocated over $2 billion in 2021 with Alliance Share going towards acquisitions and new builds, share repurchases and dividends. We added 991,335 sites through acquisitions and new builds, respectively in the year, following that, on January 4th, with over 1400 sites acquired in Tanzania. Finally, we published our second corporate sustainability report at the end of the year. Evidencing our continued focus on and success in environmental, social, and governance matters. We take great pride in our performance throughout 2021 and we're very excited about the upcoming year.  The current operating environment for our industry and our internal excellence of operational execution combined to give us great confidence that we will produce very strong results this year. And I believe our full year 2022 outlook provided in today's earnings release supports that confidence. Our customers are all very busy, and we believe we are well-positioned to help them achieve their operational and network goals. I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and contributions to our success, and I look forward to sharing our 2022 results with you as we move through the year. And with that, Ryan, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Okay. . Our first question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Phil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. Two things. So for -- can you just talk about what's built-in for DISH and AT&T in the current guide.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, we're not going to get too specific, Phil, but we -- there will -- DISH has rolled over quite a bit of activity that will be in our outlook as revenues for 2022. I'll speak generally with AT&T and really just track their public comments, which is that they anticipate a step-up in their level of activity when the 3.45 equipment becomes available midyear, so that they can combine that with C-band equipment and do a one-stop or a one truck roll stop. So if -- I mean, knowing our history and knowing that you really need all your leasing activity in the first nine months of the year to impact that fiscal year's results. I would say you have more probably in there from DISH as opposed to any kind of incremental step-up this fiscal year for AT&T, although we would certainly expect to see that quite a bit greater in 2023.
Phil Cusick: Okay. And then second, if I can, anything we should think about in terms of site development, either front-loaded or back-loaded, and the current guide anywhere? Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: I think it's matching up pretty well with anticipating where leasing revenue is and will be headed for at least the next couple of quarters. So I think it's a current to two quarter forward look at activity.
Phil Cusick: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Brett Feldman: Yes. Thanks. To about M&A, if you don't mind. And first now that you're in the Philippines, I understand you're mostly going to be doing that through greenfield builds, but how are you thinking about that as maybe a beachhead for broader expansion across Asia and what is the M&A opportunities look like over there? And then just on the data center side of things you've gotten further into operating a very small portfolio. We've clearly seen some of your peers get bigger, a few M&A in the data center space. Are you at a point where you're thinking that might become a more interesting priority for your capital allocation, or do you still think that this is mostly a bit of a niche period for as you understand the synergy between those assets and your tower assets? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah. In Southeast Asia, there's a number of opportunities, Brett. Carrier dispositions we think will be coming. And just like anywhere else in the world, we will look at that mostly from its financial sensibilities, not that anything strategic as we know necessarily combines North America with the Far East or anywhere in between. So just like with every other decision we make, it will be primarily made on its financial attributes. But having said that, we would love to continue to grow, and that is our goal and remains our number one priority is using capital to grow the portfolio. The second question --
Brett Feldman: Data centers.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah. I think we're going to -- you're going to continue to see our current pattern of behavior remaining there. We like data centers. But in terms of a big investment, much bigger than kind of what we've been doing it, we'd really have to get to the point where it was absolutely clear that there were great synergies and the data centers would lead to expanded activity at tower site. And while there are certain pieces of evidence to force that, it has not really been proven out yet. So I think it's going to be the latter of the two pass that you framed in your question. And we will continue to learn the business and grow the business very, very modestly. It actually has turned out to be very good so far in the two that we've had. We've had demands for increased capacity. We're actually investing additional capital to grow the capacity in both Jacksonville and Chicago, and that's based on contracted tenant demand. So I mean, so far so good, but not -- it's not material today. It won't be material this year. And we'll see where it goes in the future.
Brett Feldman: Thank you.
Operator: Next, over line of Michael Rollins with Citi, please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Well, thanks and good afternoon. Two questions if I could. First, Jeff, you're describing some of the visibility and the demand picture in 2023 and beyond. Just curious how's your visibility today different maybe from times in the past. And if there's a sense of the type of average growth, investors should be expecting over the next few years. And then just on the balance sheet on target leverage, just given some of the recent changes in rate, just curious what your current perspective is on target net debt leverage, maybe in the current year and then over time.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, in terms of visibility, Mike, it hasn't really changed that much in our views around -- and the comments really about this year's activity going into 2023 really are a combination of what our customers have said as to how many sites that they're going to be able to get to this year. What their capital plans are, and what our own internal backlogs are showing. And basically to over simplify it, there's going to be a lot of work still left to do by the end of this year. So that's what gives us confidence about 2023 and not sure it will all be done by the end of 2023. So average growth rates over the next year. I mean, I think on a gross basis, you're still looking at the mid-to-high single. The budgets that we've been, we've been talking about, we feel good about that.  And in terms of leverage, we've talked about this a lot over time. 60 basis point movement in the 10-year, while it seemingly had done quite a bit of impact to our trading multiple. It really doesn't impact the way we think about structure and capital allocation and balance sheet. So we're not really changed anything today based on where the 10-year is now if -- hopefully it doesn't. But if it goes up materially from here, we have to revisit that. The fact that we do pay a dividend puts a little bit more caution and conservatism and where we ultimately want to take leverage or maintain leverage and an increasing rate environment. But the movement that we've seen so far this year really has it caused us to rethink any of the big picture balance sheet structural points.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James, please go ahead.
Richard Prentiss: Good afternoon everybody.
Jeffrey Stoops: Hey, Rick.
Richard Prentiss:  questions. Jeff, on Dish's call last week, Charlie Ergen mentioned how in the future maybe there is some ability to share spectrum, particularly in that 3.45 DoD spectrum band, but maybe some of the other spectrum bands as well. How do you guys look at that, and how do you actually even monitor it.
Jeffrey Stoops: There are certain filings that would allow you to monitor it. You have to work at it. But there is a certain reliance on customer transparency, because all the leases really talk only about deploying and using spectrum that is owned or controlled by the lessee. So that's really not -- it's not something that would be allowed under our current leases without some additional discussions and modifications to the lease. But in terms of actually -- it's not like there's necessarily going to be new equipment on the tower to do that. But you would be able to figure that out through RF tests based on each customer's signal strength in that particular area. And if they're not on the tower officially, but for some reason they're broadcasting as a strong signal of 3.45, you know you've got a sharing issue.
Richard Prentiss: I think you also called out that obviously CPI is going to be up, escalators in LatAm. Quickly, math suggests, instead of being in the fours, you might be in the sixes. But where does CPI go and how should we think about the pacing in Latin America or all your international markets on what we should think I've been CPI in escalators, Brendan?
Brendan Cavanagh: Rick, I mean, they're obviously the majority of our international escalators are in Brazil. Brazil and South Africa being our largest markets. We do have some concentration of leases and a couple of time periods during the year based on acquisitions that we've done over the years and the leaseback associated with those. But otherwise over time, it's fairly well evenly spread in. So we've put in certain basic assumptions for purposes of guidance, obviously, some of those are our best estimate today as to where it will be at the point that the biggest escalator concentration happens. But I think that they are reasonable, if not, maybe a touch conservative.
Richard Prentiss: And those concentration points, are they more in the middle of the year? I'm trying to remember back from some of those old acquisitions.
Jeffrey Stoops: I mean, one of them is in the late spring and one is in the late fall.
Richard Prentiss: Okay. And last one for me, you also touched on that Sprint churn is not going to be as low in the current calendar year '22 as might have been first thought. Can you update us and just remind us, what is the cumulative Sprint churn you're expecting and can you give us a feeling as far as how much you're thinking right now, might hit '23 or '24?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah. Our assumptions right now are pretty much the same as what we've disclosed before. When we talked about '22 in last year when we gave our projections for it, we said we'd be somewhere in the $30 or $35 million range. We actually are thinking we're somewhere on the lower end of that right now based on just some slight movements in timing around various decommissionings and stuff. So all that means is that that probably rolls into next year, our projections for '23 and '24 that we've given before are $10 million to $20 million in each year. That's still the case. But obviously if numbers shift in '22 at all, that would slightly affect '23. But really, we have a fairly small level of churn expected for the next couple of years. Before we see our bigger years, which --
Richard Prentiss: After this year?
Jeffrey Stoops: -- yes, after this year, which '25 and '26 are the bigger years where we expect to see the majority of our Sprint related churn.
Richard Prentiss: Makes sense. Thanks for the extra color, we'll see you guys next week.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed, please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Jeff, I just paid like $600 to have Roto-Rooter clear a drain for me, which I'm pretty sure was double the last time I had to do it. Can you give us a sense of the labor market and whether that's having any impact and all the construction activities of these telcos out there and whether you think that has any impact on their speed at the moment?
Jeffrey Stoops: Walter, that is more information than I needed to hear.
Walter Piecyk: But it was amazing. At $600 to have a drain , I couldn't fucking believe it. The point is that we're all seeing this. We're all seeing our expenses go up. It’s not -- who knows how transitory it is. But are the operators, are they playing these games? When you look at the services, businesses, do you think this has any impact on the business? A lot of times you in the last couple of quarters, you guys meaning collectively the tower industry and to all, it's not a big deal everything fine. It's just hard to believe given what we see in the market right now that that's not having some impact on it.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah. And it is having some impact in absolute terms, but we are -- I think we're managing it pretty well. So here's what's going on. So there is wage pressure everywhere. So in the services business, we generally work on fixed fees. In the site consulting business, which is the zoning business. In the construction business, though, which was most of the revenue, and will be this year, that's all bid. And it's bid contemporaneously, so we're able to pass a lot of that on, assuming we win the bid. So we're actually managing it okay. I mean, it has started over a year ago and we're very happy with the profits and the margins that we're producing in that business and our outlook implies that we're going to do it again. So yes, it is happening, but we are managing it in a good way, some of which gets passed on through to the customer because of the bid process than the way the work is awarded.
Walter Piecyk: When you said I think it was Phil at asked about dish and I think you used the term rolled over to did that. When you say rolled over to that, does that mean that that was lease revenue that maybe a little while ago you thought would have hit in 2021 analysis going to be hitting in 2022 instead, is that what you mean by rolled over?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. Yes, it means we the leases -- the leasing activity has been tremendous. The revenue recognition on those leases lags based on either a fixed end day or the earlier of construction. So that's where we managed and estimate that, we were estimating a little bit higher last year. But the reality is the leases are signed up, they rolled over into this year, and it gives us obviously, solid confidence for where DISH's revenue contribution will be this year.
Walter Piecyk: Okay. My last question is --
Jeffrey Stoops: Leases that were signed up that had not been done accruing revenue in 2021?
Walter Piecyk: Right. So just better visibility for '22.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah.
Walter Piecyk: So my last question on the  policy, I think you had mentioned in the prepared comments, you highlighted 25% of AFFO per share. Obviously 20% growth was good. So I think about like a company like Cogent, which gets a very elevated evaluation. It's because they --  goes out there and predictably says like the same dividend increase every quarter. So is the 25% of AFFO per share, is that what we should just use as kind of a benchmark and then yield investors can just look at AFFO and then just predict the dividend growth as a result of the growth of the AFFO per share? Or does that make more sense maybe --
Jeffrey Stoops: No, I think we will grow. I think what we have done we will continue to do, which is grow our dividend faster than our AFFO per share growth. Now we have that luxury because we started with a low payout. And on a yield basis, it's still low. But as we've always said, going back to before we paid a dividend, while we want to pay a dividend to expand the base of our Investor universe. We believe that we will make our shareholders more money by keeping the money inside the company and compounding it through portfolio growth and stock repurchases.
Walter Piecyk: Right. So why not then, rather than like try to say, hey, we're growing at faster . Just put -- like just tell the yield investor it will grow minimum x percent, whether that's 10%,15%, whatever the number is you want to pick. And then just give them a very predictable growth rate that you can bring all these people in in order to drive the stock.
Jeffrey Stoops: We have talked about a -- an amount of growth in five-year increments. And I think we've talked about 20% annually.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. We've said, I mean, in the past, we've been pretty clear that we expect to grow it for the next several years by at least 20% per year. And I guess we've done --
Walter Piecyk: I guess you just need to repeat it on your prepared remarks every quarterly like Dave does, and then you can get that benefit. Okay. Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Del Deo: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking questions. I guess, first, Jeff, I was hoping you could talk a bit more about your aspirations for the Philippines. Maybe a bit more about the magnitude of the Greenfield opportunity over the coming years, and maybe describe a little the competition you are seeing or expect to see because if I'm not mistaken, several other tower codes have jumped into that market too since it opened up. And then second -- sorry, go ahead.
Jeffrey Stoops: I was going to answer your question, but.
Nicholas Del Deo: Oh, sure. Sure.
Jeffrey Stoops: So the Philippines has a 110 million people and growing. And they have about 24,000 cell sites. So there is a huge opportunity based on those numbers to expand wireless networks. And a lot of greenfield sites will need to be built. The market we like it from a stability point of view, from a land use or regulation point of view, there are over 20 tower companies in country. We know that because you have to get a license to operate as a tower company in the Philippines. But we think there's only five or six of them, including us, that are strong and have the confidence of the customers to get meaningful build-to-suit opportunities going forward. We found the customers in the Philippines to be very smart and very careful in terms of who they partner with. And I think those are the kinds of relationships where our history, experience, and our people on the ground will distinguish themselves and we will excel. So I think thousands of towers will be built in the Philippines every year for the next 10 years. And I think if we get our fair share, that will build a nice business there.
Nicholas Del Deo: Okay, that's terrific, and it sounds like the headline competition may not be as intense as it first seems, which is good to hear.
Jeffrey Stoops: The numbers are higher. The folks with real capabilities, though, are much lower.
Nicholas Del Deo: Got it. And then maybe second question. You've repurchased a lot of stock so far in 2022, maybe just some updated thoughts on the relative appeal of M&A versus repurchases here? And maybe any general observations about trends in the M&A market and what you are saying?
Jeffrey Stoops: Based on $303 stock price in the midpoint of our guidance, that's a 26 times AFFO per share multiple if I'm not mistaken. And that currently -- while I think there is some rationalization going on in the markets, both domestic and internationally. There are a number of transactions that are selling for quite a bit more than that on a multiple basis. So that should lead you to conclude that while we continue to want to grow our portfolio and we'll make every effort to do that. We will do it only in those circumstances where it makes financial sense. And that stock repurchases at today's price relative to private market values are extremely attractive.
Nicholas Del Deo: Got it, that's great. Thank you, Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Greg Williams with Cowen please go ahead.
Greg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one just on the international guide, looks like Tanzania is contributing about $45 million in revenue. But how much is being contributed in terms of EBITDA and AFFO per share for Tanzania? Second question is just more philosophical on the telco versus cloud debate. There's an ongoing debate of cloud providers offering network-as-a-service  in the fray. Does that lighten up the equipment load for you guys? Maybe not the top of the towers, but at the bottom of the towers, and how do you see that dynamic unfolding? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: The contribution from Tanzania is approximately $22 million to EBITDA, and will be very similar to AFFO.
Brendan Cavanagh: And on your second question, I mean, we have always thought of ourselves, first and foremost, as houses and housing antennas, radios. So while there is some movement as to the compute, that's going on at the tower site, we really haven't seen that impacted and it really doesn't impact our thoughts in terms of antenna and radio locations so far lots going on there. We really don't see or expect a material impact, at least in terms of the way we structure leases and think about our business.
Greg Williams: Got it. Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes.
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: Hi. Thank you. I have two questions. So the first one is regarding just the wage inflation conversation you had earlier. Now, we all are operating with this idea that prices and costs of labor are going to be reduced or normalize. But what if they don't. What measures will you have to take if they don't actually normalize and this new pricing level is actually the new normal.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, we will do what we always do, which is take a fine pencil and work through the aspects of our costs where we can do something about it. In some cases, we may be able to improve upon that and in some cases we won't. What is good though in this conversations is people to realize how small, frankly for us compared to other businesses that these changes can really have in our bottom line because of the 70% plus EBITDA margin. We have great operating leverage in this business, and thankfully we've demonstrated over the years and that continues to be true about that a little amount of people can manage and operate a lot of towers. So we have that going for us, but we'll do what we always do, we'll execute and make changes as necessary to make sure we have the best team on the field at the best possible expense levels for the company.
Sami Badri: And then maybe just for us to know because there are some new contracts in place with the amylase and all the telcos more formalizing what they plan on spending or what they prefer to spend. So does the fact that there are MLA s in place make the renegotiation process more complex or no difference at all?
Jeffrey Stoops: It makes things much less complex in terms of the business that you're doing with your counterparty during the life of the MLA. Not sure I got your question. The renegotiation of what? With employees or the renegotiation of an MLA?
Sami Badri: Renegotiation of the MLA, and the fees you're getting, the contributing payments from your customer, and relatively matching the wage inflation against price. So just managing your margin just to get an idea on where you're going to be turning the levers.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, when we get to that point, that certainly will be a consideration. But I would just say, I think you focused on something that we don't believe will be a material issue at all. And I think if you look at our outlook, you'll see increasing margins.
Sami Badri: Maybe I can just add to that, that our actual cash SGNA is about 6% of our total revenues. So it's impact from a personnel standpoint is not that much. Our largest expense on our tower business or our ground leases, which also have -- they have fixed escalators. So that's an expense that can be controlled. It doesn't adjust with any of these inflationary pressures that you're talking about.
Jeffrey Stoops: I hope you can tell from our comments, Sami, that we don't really worry about that that much, and we're fully aware of where the market is today and where it might go.
Sami Badri: Absolutely. I just -- these are questions that I get on my side, so I was just hoping I could run them by you guys. The other kind of question I actually do get as well from investors. I was hoping you could share your take on is you are very focused on emerging market opportunities, seen by the acquisitions and the announcements you've made. And then there are just -- your competitors going after, or your competitor going after developing -- or developed markets, sorry, within the European region. And that seems to be a very compelling and digestible opportunity in the wake of international and geopolitical dynamics. Is there a reason why you guys haven't really tilted on the European side as an opportunity for M&A, rather than sticking to emerging markets.
Jeffrey Stoops: It's entirely due to our assessment of return on invested capital for those opportunities versus what we believe we will achieve in Tanzania, Philippines, and markets like that. We've talked a lot, Sami, over the years about how we liked the European market. But when you look at what -- who is competing for assets over there. And the fact that a number of them are -- they denominate their investors and their results in euros, and you can borrow euros, at least you could. I'm not sure what today is, but you could borrow at less than zero. It just became a market that we did not find compelling from an investment perspective and from shareholder value creation perspective. Is it otherwise a good market, sure.
Sami Badri:  Well, thank you, guys, very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of David Guarino with Green Street, please go ahead.
David Guarino: Hey, thanks. On the $65 million of domestic new leasing activity this year, I believe if you hit that, that'd be a record for the company. Just want to know, do you think that's a sustainable pace going forward or is '22 just an outsized year?
Jeffrey Stoops: There's 2023, we think it's going to be really good too. And that's kind of as far as the crystal ball goes right now.
David Guarino: Okay.
Jeffrey Stoops: So while we're not making any promises or guaranteeing anything, we don't -- we would not sit here today and tell you that we were sure that 2022 will be the high watermark. It may not be.
David Guarino: Okay. It's definitely encouraging. Maybe going back to the Philippines comment. I don't think you mentioned it, but could you share which M&A would bring their tenant on your new builds? That would be interesting to know just in light of the tower dispositions that several of the carriers have into that recently. And then with the opportunity --
Jeffrey Stoops: It's both globe and smart.
David Guarino: Okay. That's very helpful. Could you just tell us what's the day one yield that you are going to achieve on the tower build, given that large opportunities that you talked about?
Jeffrey Stoops: Double-digit.
David Guarino:  better than what you would get in LatAm or is it comparable to the other emerging markets you're in?
Jeffrey Stoops: It's comparable. And that's on a tower cash flow yield. But that's kind of what we look for when we're putting new towers up.
David Guarino: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good evening, Jeff you talked a little bit about the M&A environment. You grew your side portfolio about 8% since last February, how are you thinking about the 5% to 10% long-term guidance? Is that still something you see as achievable even in this M&A environment or my debt more be through M&A or is it more maybe some built-to-suit to hit those sort of numbers?
Jeffrey Stoops: We would definitely go to need some build-to-suit, Simon, to get to any number. But I still feel pretty good about the 5% to 10%. Certainly the 5% and that is still a goal mark. We will need to do a little bit of work around that. like we do every year. But we managed to look a lot and find some things that workforce. We certainly did that between the PG&E deal in Tanzania. We're going to build a lot more towers this year than we built in the prior year. And if we get one good-sized acquisition out there somewhere, we'll hit at least the bottom end of that range.
Simon Flannery: Great. And on the Philippines, you talked about the large market opportunity. What is critical mass for you in a market like that? Is that 500 towers, a thousand towers? Because is that 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah. Those are good guesses. It's at least 500, so we have gone in there and with the belief and the expectation that we will get to at least 500 towers in that market.
Simon Flannery: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And the final question we have in queue comes from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets, please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Awesome. Maybe two questions for Brendan. Could you share what the backlog of lease applications, what that was up year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Then going back on the $65 million in new leasing in 2022, I would imagine that that is predominantly second-half-weighted. Is it possible that you could exit the year with say, $20 million in new leases on a year-over-year basis? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Brian, I don't want to be too specific on the backlog. It's obviously up a good bit from where it was last year, but we came out of last year with a reasonably good backlog. We had a slow first quarter and then it began to ramp and it's been at a pretty high level that's been fairly consistent throughout at least the second half of the year and as much as back into the second quarter of last year. I don't want to get into the specifics too much.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, if you looked at who was in that backlog in December of 2020, you didn't really have DISH.
Brendan Cavanagh: We had no DISH. Yes.
Jeffrey Stoops: And you really didn't have Verizon C-band, so it's up big. December 31 to December 31.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean, the question is how much of it was sitting there at the time that hadn't yet been signed. If you look at the growth though and the actual number that $65 million that we just printed versus $38, I believe for last year. That percentage from the time that activity was down to when it started to pick up. That's representative of what we saw on the growth in the backlog. So that's almost doubling the backlog in terms of dollars. And then I'm sorry, the second question. I apologize.
Brandon Nispel: I guess just looking at the new leasing again my numbers, you're at $11 million in new leasing today to get to the guide to $65 million would suggest that you need to get to something like a high teens, low $20 million  for the fourth-quarter and just making sure that that's 
Jeffrey Stoops: That's right. Yes. No, that's accurate. I expect that it's going to get -- it's going to go up every single quarter I would expect during the course of this year just based on what we've already signed up and the timing of when we're estimating the commencements. So your numbers are in the right range.
Brandon Nispel: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions in queue.
Jeffrey Stoops: Great. I want to thank everybody for joining us to wrap up our 2021 results, and we greatly look forward to reporting as we move through 2022. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. I'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the third quarter results for SBA. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session. . As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2021 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, November 1, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our third quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. SBA had another great quarter with financial and operating results ahead of our expectations and continued strong momentum into the end of the year. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $535.5 million and cash site leasing revenues were $525.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter. They were a tailwind though on comparisons to the third quarter of 2020, positively impacting revenues by $3.2 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.6% over the third quarter of 2020 including the impact of 2.5% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.3% on a net basis, including 2.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter was at a similar level to the second quarter, which had represented the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of execution, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog continued to grow during the quarter and finished the quarter higher and at a new multiyear high. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the balance of this year and into 2022. During the third quarter, amendment activity represented 45% of our domestic bookings with 55% coming from new leases. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.2% net, including 2.7% of churn or 7.9% on a gross basis. International leasing activity increased again quarter-over-quarter and was the highest in over a year. Churn grew some in the quarter as well and is anticipated to increase further as we experience the impacts of carrier consolidations and other network and contract modifications in Central America. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another quarter of increased leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 9.5% on a constant currency basis. During the third quarter, 84.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.7% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.4% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $428.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.6% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.9% or 90.8% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $407 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.7%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. During the third quarter, our services business produced record results for the second quarter in a row with $53.8 million in revenue and $12.5 million of segment operating profit. Activity levels remained very high in the quarter, and backlogs also continued to grow, finishing the quarter at another all-time high level in our company's history. Based on our strong third quarter and the growing backlog, we have increased our full year 2021 outlook for site development revenue for the third quarter in a row, now expecting $200 million of site development revenue at the midpoint of our outlook range. AFFO in the third quarter was $302.5 million. AFFO per share was $2.71, an increase of 13.9% over the third quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 144 communication sites for total cash consideration of $57.1 million. We also built 87 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase approximately 1,700 additional sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $231 million, including approximately 1,400 sites and approximately $175 million related to the previously announced deal to acquire towers from Airtel Tanzania. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter of next year, and we anticipate the Airtel Tanzania transaction to close in stages starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Consistent with our prior outlook, our updated 2021 outlook assumes that the Airtel acquisition closes at the end of the year. And thus, we have included the entire purchase price in our outlook for discretionary capital expenditures but we have included no revenue or tower cash flow associated with these assets. In addition to new tower assets, we also continue to invest in the lands under our sect. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend our lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years. In this afternoon's earnings press release, we included our updated outlook for full year 2021. Notwithstanding our assumption of weaker fourth quarter foreign exchange rates, our updated outlook includes increased expectations for site leasing revenue, site development revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. These increases result from high services activity levels with our carrier customers, anticipated timing shifts in domestic consolidation churn, reduced cash interest expense as a result of recent refinancings and the impact of recent share repurchases. We anticipate that our strong domestic leasing bookings during the second and third quarters will be supportive of improved incremental organic domestic leasing revenue in 2022, which we will share on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $11.9 billion of total debt and $11.7 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.2x. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.6x, the highest in the company's history. On July 7, the company amended its revolving credit facility. Among other things, the amendment increased the total commitment under the facility from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion, extended the maturity date of the facility through July 7, 2026, lowered the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees under the facility and incorporated sustainability link targets into the facility, allowing for interest rate and commitment fee adjustments based on how we perform against those targets. As of today, we have no amounts outstanding under our revolver. On October 14, the company repaid at par the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2013-2C Tower Securities, which had an anticipated repayment date of April 11, 2023. On October 27, the company through an existing trust issued 895 million of 1.84% secured tower revenue securities Series 2021-2C, which have an anticipated repayment date of April 9, 2027, and a final maturity date of October 10, 2051. And $895 million of 2.593% secured tower revenue securities Series 2021-3C, which have an anticipated repayment date of October 9, 2031, and a final maturity date of October 10, 2056. The aggregate $1.79 billion of these Tower Securities have a blended interest rate of 2.217% and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment date of 7.8 years. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and remaining proceeds will be used to redeem the entire aggregate $1.1 billion principal amount of the 2016 4.875% senior notes and to pay all premiums and costs associated with such redemption. Pro forma for these financing activities, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt drops to 2.6% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 5 years. And the interest rate on 97% of our outstanding debt is fixed.  During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares of our common stock for $150 million at an average price per share of $340.70. Subsequent to September 13, we repurchased an additional 601,000 shares for $200 million at an average price per share of $332.72. Combined, the average purchase price for the $350 million of repurchases was $336.09 per share. All the shares we purchased were retired. After these repurchases, we had $125 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our subsequently replaced $1 billion stock repurchase plan. On October 28, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan replacing the prior plan. The new plan has no time deadline and will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by the company's Board of Directors at any time in its sole discretion. As of today, the company has the full $1 billion of authorization remaining under the new plan. The company shares outstanding at September 30, 2021, were 109.5 million, compared to 111.4 million at September 30, 2020, a reduction of 1.8%. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $63.6 million or $0.58 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.58 per share payable on December 16, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 18, 2021. Today's dividend announcement represents a payout ratio of 21% of third quarter AFFO per share, which leaves us ample room for material future dividend growth. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had another very good quarter in the third quarter, exceeding our own expectations. As you've heard, we continue to see very high levels of carrier activity in our U.S. business. Each of our major customers was busy in the quarter. Verizon beginning their C-band deployments; T-Mobile continuing their ubiquitous deployment of their 600 megahertz and 2.5 gigahertz spectrum; DISH continuing their torrid pace from the second quarter, signing up new agreements to facilitate the build-out of their brand-new nationwide 5G network; and AT&T remaining steady. Notwithstanding the high levels of new leasing revenue that we signed up during the third quarter, we still finished the quarter adding new multiyear high backlog of pending leases and amendment applications. Based on this backlog and conversations with our customers, we expect to continue seeing elevated domestic leasing activities through the balance of this year and well into 2022. In addition to high domestic leasing activity levels, we produced record services revenue in the third quarter, surpassing our second quarter record. Our customers are all focused on building out their 5G networks, particularly targeting upgrades to their macro networks. Similar to our domestic leasing backlogs, our services backlog continued to grow during the quarter and reached a new all-time time for the company at quarter end. The strong third quarter performance and growing backlogs have allowed us to increase our full year outlook for all revenue-related line items. Internationally, we began to see our markets starting to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. We again produced quarter-over-quarter sequential increases in new lease and amendment executions and ended up with solid leasing results in the third quarter that were ahead of plan. During the quarter, we signed up 55% of new international revenue through new leases and 45% through amendments to existing leases. Our largest contributors to our leasing results came from Brazil and South Africa, our 2 largest international markets. As our international markets continue to recover from the pandemic, and upcoming spectrum auctions across a number of our markets are planned, including Brazil, which will put more spectrum into the hands of our customers, we expect to continue to see growth in the level of network investment made by our carrier customers over the next several years. We executed very well for our customers in the quarter, and we are committed to continue to do so during these future expected periods of increased demand. In addition to our strong third quarter operating results, we continue to improve our positioning with regard to our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders. During the third quarter, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility, extended the term and improved the pricing. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a new $1.79 billion securitization financing, refinancing some existing securitization debt and using the remaining proceeds to shortly repay our $1.1 billion of 4.875% 2024 unsecured notes. The weighted average interest rate of these new securities is 2.2% and the weighted average term is 7.8 years. The net result of these financing activities will be annual cash interest savings of approximately $35 million. This financing was a particularly positive outcome for SBA as we also achieved the highest debt capacity in our long history of ABS financing. As Mark mentioned earlier, our pro forma weighted average interest rate across all of our debt dropped to 2.6%, our lowest ever, and we ended the quarter at 7.2x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA well in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5 terms. Our ability to continue to drive our liquidity position higher, lower our cost of debt and extend out our maturity dates, gives us great flexibility in operating the business and allocating capital into additional investments for the benefit of our shareholders. The combination of low-cost debt and our expectations around future AFFO per share growth should make stock repurchases at the levels we have been buying very accretive to future AFFO per share. During the quarter, we continued to add to our portfolio through both building and acquiring new sites. We also signed up agreements to purchase additional sites and anticipate closing on the majority of our Tanzania transaction by year-end. In addition to portfolio growth, we continue to opportunistically buy back stock, repurchasing over 1 million shares since our last earnings call, and our announced fourth quarter dividend represents an increase of 25% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of last year. We feel very good about our current capital structure and ability to allocate capital to generate incremental value for our shareholders. We're in a very good time for the industry and for SBA specifically. Our customers are very busy. Our financial position is very strong and the future continues to hold many opportunities for us. We're excited about pursuing those opportunities, and I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and their contributions to our success. I look forward to sharing our year-end results with you next quarter. And with that, Ryan, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: . Our first question will come from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Richard Prentiss: A couple of questions. Obviously, you guys are pretty excited with the backlog, services business, leasing business. If I look specifically at the implied change to new lease amendment activity in the fourth quarter in the U.S., it looks like a pretty nice step up. How should we think about -- I know you're not giving guidance yet, but how should we think about how that plays into '22 as far as does it build throughout '22? Is it fairly level loaded, now that we're sitting here in November, you probably have some pretty good visibility to what the pacing of '22 looks like, not the actual number?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I mean, given the fact that we report those things on a trailing 12 basis and knowing what we had in the fourth quarter a year ago and first quarter of this year, I think it's going to build, Ric, as we -- at least as we move into the middle of next year. And then we'll see what happens with lease-up then because that will start to have some year-over-year comps that we're going to be working off some pretty good numbers for the back half of this year.
Richard Prentiss: Okay. And then on the escalator side, is there anything that varies the escalators quarter-to-quarter that causes any swings on the way you guys have your contracts set up. We've seen some bouncing around some of the other tower guys in the U.S., specifically where you have more fixed.
Jeffrey Stoops: Not in the U.S.
Richard Prentiss: Fairly consistent, obviously, maybe 3%, 3.3%, sound pretty consistent.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. Again, in the U.S., I mean, a lot of our international stuff is CPI-based.
Richard Prentiss: Last one for me. Can you update us on Sprint churn, what kind of magnitude you're looking at? Have you gotten any indication yet from T-Mobile? Is it mostly going to just be the co-located sites? Is it going to be nearby side? So just kind of maybe frame for us size and timing and kind of how you're having those discussions with T-Mobile and Sprint?
Brendan Cavanagh: Ric, it's Brendan. So first of all, you may have noticed in our bridge that we made an adjustment to actually reduce our domestic churn impact for '21. That's basically all due to Sprint. It's a timing issue, though. It's taking them perhaps a little bit longer than we were anticipating because we're making some estimates, obviously, around that heading into it. That doesn't change our view on the total potential exposure for churn, but it shifts the timing back to slightly. So I would expect that to kind of move to next year. In terms of what we expect today, we've given some ranges in the past, and I'll kind of reiterate that. They move a little bit, obviously, as we learn more about it. But this year, in '21, we would expect the total impact to end up being somewhere around $7 million. Next year is a higher year for us based on the timing of when leases hit the end of their terms. We expect it to be probably at the higher end of our previously stated range of $30 million to $35 million. I'd say it's closer to $35 million, mostly because of the shift in timing I just mentioned. And then in 2023 and 2024, we would estimate somewhere in the $10 million to $20 million range for impact in each of those years. And our biggest years of exposure are 2025 and '26 where the range would be somewhere in that $45 million-ish range, $40 million to $50 million, say, to put brackets around it for each of those years. And then some de minimis amount after that. In terms of where it's coming from, a lot of it is on overlap sites, but some of it is certainly on sites that are proximity sites. And then in some cases, it's not always totally clear to us. I think they're still working through that. We don't have total vision on what they're doing with other neighboring sites. But I would say it's a mix of the two. But obviously, the greatest focus as it relates to our portfolio will be the sites where they have direct overlap.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery: So you talked about the strong leasing end that DISH had this torrid pace. Can you help us understand how the bookings to billings will go? And are we seeing much of DISH in the fourth quarter guide or then you revised full year guide? Or is that really going to flow through more in 2022? And then you talked about the benefits of recent spectrum auctions or ongoing spectrum auctions, I guess, here and in Brazil and elsewhere, maybe on the 3.45 specifically in the U.S. Do you think that's going to create much incremental leasing? Or do you think a lot of that can be encompassed by the carriers in their C-band deployments? And any sense of when you might start to see that 3.45 get deployed? Could it pull forward some of that second phase of C-band builds to put up this spectrum?
Jeffrey Stoops: Our understanding, Simon, on your last question is that the 3.45 will require new radios. So there will be some incremental activity there that the industry should benefit from. What was your first question?
Brendan Cavanagh: It's timing.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. So I think we've explained this before. But we have a master deal with DISH, and there's commitments and a lot of benefits going back and forth between each parties. I mean one of the things, Simon, that was in there is DISH has a payments schedule such that after signing, they have until a date certain for installation of their equipment on that site before we begin to start collecting revenue. So the vast, vast, vast notwithstanding the tremendous amount of lease-ups that we've had, the vast majority of all that recognition doesn't start until 2022. So the answer as to is there much, if anything, ambition in the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the activity, the answer is no. I think you had a third question. Did I miss the...
Simon Flannery: It was on the 3.45, any sense on the timing of when that you might start to see that deployment relative to the C-band?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I mean, my understanding is decisions get made. Final auction results are known and decisions get made in the first quarter of next year. I do not believe there's the same clearing requirements that you have with the C-band. So I don't see any reason why we wouldn't start to see some activity in the second half.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes. So I had a question about international exposure and basically EMEA and maybe tackle Europe and Africa separately, thoughts on how those regions might be appealing to you going forward? And then domestically, wanted to find out about the timing of revenue. You talked about DISH, but more generally, as you think about the availability of workforce and people to actually construct sites. What's your thinking with respect to any pressures that the industry might see in 2022 that might affect leasing revenue recognition as opposed to just bookings?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. In terms of the globe, Jonathan, I mean we look all over and we look to find areas that fit our criteria. And we found a lot of that, obviously, in the Western Hemisphere, some of that in Africa. And I believe we will continue to find those opportunities as we go forward on a country-by-country basis. Africa has a lot of growth, certainly has some risk. But if you get into the right price and you operate well as we believe we do, you will do well. Europe is a fine market. We just have not found opportunities that are at prices that we think makes sense for us given our other opportunities to deploy capital. But we keep looking. I mean, we look at everything. That's what people expect us to do. In terms of the labor market, we watch that carefully because obviously, a lot of other industries are suffering right now. We are not. We have a large internal workforce in cruise. We also use outsourced crews for some of the work. And right now, it's all working out okay. There's a number of training resources and opportunities that we think will increase the available workforce over the next several years. So I think generally, we feel okay, but I mean, that really is a quarter-by-quarter question that you asked. So the best I can tell you today is this quarter, next quarter, we feel okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed.
Walter Piecyk: Jeff, can you -- to the extent you can provide us a little bit more color about the Sprint like the churn delay, I guess. I mean is there any indication that as they go through the portfolio, they're recognizing that maybe they're not going to turn off as many sites as originally. I know you talked about the next 2 years, and they were generally all in the same ballpark. But qualitatively, is there -- are they still, I think, targeting overall the same amount, maybe more, maybe less? Any thoughts on that?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Walt, this is Brendan. Yes, it seems like thus far, from what we've seen in our communications with them that it's generally still targeting the same thing that we thought originally more or less. I think the shift here is really just the timing on moving off of some of the sites. You may have even seen they talked about some delay in shutting down the CDMA network. I think that probably is a factor in it. So I don't think that the overall focus is shifting at all, but the timing might be slightly different. That's all.
Walter Piecyk: Okay. And then on the inorganic stuff, this year was a pretty big year although it seems like with the guidance, Q4 is whatever, you're still obviously up versus last year. But when you think about '22 in terms of new sites, M&A, that type of stuff, any sense on kind of what that market will look like for you?
Jeffrey Stoops: I think it will continue to look challenging from an acquisition perspective really based on price wall. Prices continue to remain high, and in our opinion, without much differentiation for quality, which is where we end up being very selective and picking our spots carefully. I do think there's enough out there for us to certainly hit the low end of our historical targeted range of 5% portfolio growth. I imagine with Tanzania and some increased activity that we expected some of our existing markets that we will build more towers next year as well. So all in all, that will be -- the 5% to 10% portfolio growth will be the goal again next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.
Batya Levi: Just a couple of follow-ups. First, on the international side, you mentioned that churn should remain elevated for some time. Can you provide more color on that? And capital allocation priorities, can you help us think about maybe discretionary CapEx, excluding M&A, does that stay elevated as you ramp maybe augmentation CapEx to support higher growth? Yes. That's it.
Brendan Cavanagh: So on the international churn, we've been -- as you probably seen and we talked about, I think, on previous calls that we expected some elevated international churn this year. We haven't experienced most of that yet through the year. But in the fourth quarter, we expect to see that jump. Largely due -- the primary reason is due to consolidation-related churn, particularly with Claro and Telefónica combining in Guatemala, a lot of the impacts of that are starting to be felt here in the fourth quarter, which is what's going to drive the full year number that we provided. And obviously, with it being so late in the year, it has an impact on what we would expect to report not just in the fourth quarter but in the next -- into next year. In addition, there are -- we are dealing with a number of our customers in Central America. We have some that are working through network changes due to various issues that they face. And others where the terms of the agreements are starting to come to an end, and we're working through what their future plans might look like. So we expect there might be some incremental churn associated with that, but we also would expect longer-term commitments and other business commitments as well as part of that. So it really was an indication mostly though, about the consolidation churn that we're going to experience in Q4.
Jeffrey Stoops: So Batya, on your other question about discretionary CapEx, the way you asked that question, you implied that our non-M&A discretionary CapEx was going up. I don't really think it is in terms of augmentations per tower. We don't really see anything material there. And keep in mind, there's a historical practice, which continues that our customers tend to pay most, if not all, of those augmentation dollars. Would there be something else besides the tower side, Brendan, in the discretionary CapEx?
Brendan Cavanagh: There's been some CapEx spent on the data centers that we acquired. So that might be the incremental piece that we obviously hadn't had in the past.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. And that -- just to be clear, that's in response to demand for increased megawattage and capacity at these data centers. So that is CapEx that we're extremely pleased to be able to invest.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo, MoffettNathanson.
Nicholas Del Deo: The first, if my math is right, it looks like your implied site leasing revenue and tower cash flow guidance for Q4 are about equal to what you generated in Q3, at least at the midpoint. But was there anything that helped Q3 results that won't carry through into Q4, like back billings or anything similar?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, FX.
Nicholas Del Deo: Okay. All right. Simple enough. And then I guess in terms of U.S. activity, are you seeing the incumbents deploy their mid-band spectrum and DISH with its de novo build? You're kind of engaging with you even -- relatively evenly across your portfolio. Or is there a noticeable skew towards more urban or the denser suburban markets that you serve?
Jeffrey Stoops: I don't think it's noticeably skewed. I think we're seeing activity pretty much everywhere.
Nicholas Del Deo: Okay. Okay. That's good to hear. If I can squeeze in one last one. If I look at other revenue for international, that was up by about $6 million versus your prior guidance. Is that mostly fuel, pass-through fuel or is something else going on there?
Brendan Cavanagh: No, it is mostly pass-through expenses. It's actually -- a lot of it is actually related to ground leases, in particular, in Brazil, where we pass those through to the carriers. And that -- part of that is CPI that we didn't -- while we projected CPI increases across our tenant leases, we didn't necessarily include that on the ground leases because it's a pass-through. But as that's starting to come along with the increased inflation down there, it's pushing ground rents higher, which obviously pushes the pass-through rents higher as well, plus there is some power costs, as you mentioned as well. That's the main driver.
Operator: Next, we're going to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Phil Cusick: I wanted to follow up. You said, I think, in the prepared remarks that you assume that AT&T is steady from here. Do you think AT&T is at a full run rate? Or are you just assuming that they haven't ramped up by the fourth quarter guidance period?
Jeffrey Stoops: No. I think to be clear, Phil, we said that they were steady relative to kind of last quarter. I believe that they will ramp up in the times to come.
Phil Cusick: Okay. And is the conversation is building toward that already?
Jeffrey Stoops: Let me -- I'll just leave it the way I said it. I believe that their activity levels will ramp as we move into next year.
Phil Cusick: That's more than I expected. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.
David Barden: I don't know I can follow up on that belly laugh, Jeff. So I guess I had 2 questions. One was in the prepared remarks, Brendan, you called out the Big 4, which we haven't heard in a while, and maybe wonder if the magnitude to which DISH is spending is roughly on par with what the actual Big 3 are spending in terms of your business. And then the second question I had was you also referenced some spectrum auctions that are happening in the coming months in not just domestically, but international markets. Specifically, I'm interested in South Africa. That's been a problem market from a spectrum perspective, a little messy over the last little while. I was wondering if you could kind of give us some picture as to what you thought the outlook would be for South African spectrum auctions in 2022?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. And I mean when you really parse out our comments, David, and you look at the domestic split between leasing and amendments, and you think about historically how networks get upgraded mostly through amendments. So where are all those new leases coming from? Well, they're mostly coming from DISH. So yes, for this quarter and last quarter, they're right up there in terms of quarterly contributions with the other Big 3. So that's why we said what we said. In terms of South Africa, those spectrum auctions have been pushed back a little bit. There's a lot of interplay between the wireless carriers and the government. The best that we can tell is that the auctions will be not this year, but in 2022, now are scheduled for the first half but they will be the full suite of 5G spectrum. I think it's 600 or 700 rather, 2.5 and 3.5. So you're going to have all the tools necessary for the carriers in that country to pick up what they need to move into 5G. So obviously, we're excited about that. It will mean similar to what it means in the U.S. when customers move from 4G to 5G.
David Barden: Perfect. That was exactly what I thought you would say, Jeff. So, just exactly. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins: Since you seem to be in such a generous mood to share some new information, I'll take a crack at this. So you mentioned multiyear highs for services and leasing backlog. And I was thinking back to your 10-Ks where in '19, you had a leasing backlog of about $22 million; in 2018, you had about $16 million. And on the services side, it was about over those 2 years, $55 million and $76 million. Can you share some context on how the current backlog compares to these couple of years? And then just secondly, curious if you could delve further into what you're learning from your data centers and how you're thinking about the edge and the role SBA is going to play in that in the future?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. The 10-K disclosures, Mike, are -- it's apples and oranges to what we were talking about in our earnings script and the press release. That disclosure is signed leases that have not yet commenced revenue. And when we talk about backlog, it’s applications. So those 2 things really are not correlating. But I'll give you a little more color on the backlogs. It's not multiyear high for services, it's all-time high ever. For leasing, it is a multiyear high, going back probably to the heady 4G days. But it's good. And it took a big jump up in the quarter, notwithstanding a very high degree of signings. So that's why we say what we said and why we feel good about next year. What was your second question?
Michael Rollins: What you're learning from the data centers and the edge?
Jeffrey Stoops: What we're learning is that -- it's generally a good business, data centers in general, not that anybody needs me to tell them that. But one that we like and we see synergies with the micro edge facilities where we have now -- we've got 4 or 5 of these things more being built. And in many cases, the sale was made because we were able to provide data center space in addition to the micro edge space. So there's a big demand for redundancy, for disaster recovery, for backup. So the hub-and-spoke model that we talked about earlier as to where we think this makes the most sense from our perspective is playing out, albeit a little bit slowly because I'm not sure the edge has really quite moved yet to the tower site, but it is headed in that direction.
Michael Rollins: And so where do you think this goes over time? Are towers partners to data centers are towers owners of a lot more data centers? Where does this evolve into?
Jeffrey Stoops: It could evolve in either of those directions. But it does evolve into a more converged universe. And I think ultimately, the degree of that convergence, Mike, will be how much computing power is truly needed right at the cell site. And I don't think we know yet.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.
Brett Feldman: I guess I'll have a follow-up on that one. I mean, we know your historical views on investing in fiber in the U.S. But if you were to start to see real synergy between the connectivity, between your data center assets and the edge facilities you can offer at sites. Would you maybe reconsider deploying the fiber between those locations? And then just a second question. I would imagine the big uptick in the backlog is from what we're going to start calling the Big 4 again. But I'm curious whether you're seeing anything in there from nontraditional tenants, maybe enterprises looking to deploy CBRS-based systems using your infrastructure? And if it's not in the backlog, is there anything going on from a conversation standpoint to suggest that could be percolating?
Jeffrey Stoops: On your first question, it could make sense where we control both ends of the destination to have fiber running between that we actually own. We do think, over time, Brett, that a full suite of product offerings and solutions to the customer will be good. I mean it's hard to sell someone -- it's not as easy rather, to sell someone micro edge space when at the same time you said, well, you've got to go funding a fiber. So we'll see and never say never. But we -- I don't think the way fiber has been traditionally bought, developed and deployed -- that's a business I don't know that we would enter. It's going to be more when it joins 2 ends of things that we control.
Brendan Cavanagh: And then in terms of the nontraditional tenants in the backlog, there are some certainly, Brett, but as a percentage of the total backlog it's pretty small, partially because the big carriers are so active right now that we have huge backlogs with them. And so it's pretty immaterial in terms of its overall impact.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. But there's some in there, but it in the lion's share is clearly from Big 4.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.
Colby Synesael: Great. One quick follow-up and then another one. As it relates to the international churn you've highlighted you expect it to be elevated in the fourth quarter. Is that just a 1 quarter thing? Or would you anticipate churn being elevated in 2022 versus what we’ll ultimately see in 2021? And then secondly, in the press release, you guys mentioned, I think this was quoted to Jeff. We expect elevated domestic leasing activities to continue through 2022 and perhaps beyond. I was wondering if you could just expand on that. Is that really just tied to some of the comments you've already made as it relates to DISH? Or is there really more than that? And maybe even how does AT&T in particular factor into that?
Brendan Cavanagh: Jeff, I'll start on the international churn side. I do expect it to be elevated not only in the fourth quarter but into next year, in part because the fourth quarter -- especially when we report our same-tower churn numbers, it's obviously on a trailing 12 months basis. So what happens in Q4 will be carried with us throughout the balance of the year. So next year will certainly be higher in terms of its full year impact than this year because of the concentration late in the year.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. And on the length of the activity, Colby, comments really reflect just the historical norms of the life cycle of the G upgrade going from 1G to the next. Mean when you think about where Verizon is and where AT&T is on C-band, the 3.45 stuff that's not even out yet, and where DISH is, I mean it's pretty easy to see that activity is going to move into 2023.
Colby Synesael: Do you think then that we could actually be in a situation where we just continue to see that acceleration? I mean I think one of the big debates that investors are having now is, do we start to flat line in '22? Or is there an opportunity for another step-up?
Jeffrey Stoops: I mean at some point, that has to flat line. I don't know I don't know specifically how to answer that question for next year until we see more about the 3.45 auction and understand some more of the timing. But I think flat line or not, I understand the importance of that from an investor perspective. But I mean we see years of elevated activity.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: Just curious on Brazil, if you could maybe provide us some color, you mentioned that same tower growth stepped up there in the quarter, and there's a spectrum auction coming up later this week. Do you think that could drive another wave of amendment activity across the Brazilian market?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. I clearly do because the spectrum that they're being -- that's being put forth is what's really necessary for the carriers to offer a 5G solution, which they have not yet really embarked up. So much like what's going on here in the U.S. when that spectrum is auctioned and put into use, you're going to have similar activity levels. In terms of the -- you want to speak, Brendan to the increase lease-up?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, so the growth rate stepped up, it's really a combination of 2 things. One is the escalators are higher because of the CPI-based increases. And as inflation has increased in Brazil, that's caused our escalators to be increasing. And then we have in addition, seeing increased actual leasing activity over the last 2 quarters where it's sequentially increased over what it had been at the beginning of the year. I think really, as we come out of some of the more serious COVID-related periods in Brazil, we're starting to see the carriers moving back more towards traditional spending levels. And so that's encouraging as well.
Eric Luebchow: And just one follow-up for me. You mentioned building more towers next year. Just could you remind us which markets you're seeing build-to-suit opportunities and then perhaps like what you're kind of underwriting today for return or yield requirements for building new sites in terms of NOI or development yield?
Jeffrey Stoops: We will build sites next year in every market in which we are currently active. So -- and in most of those markets, more sites than we build today. And we're looking at generally 10%-ish tower cash flow yield on day 1.
Eric Luebchow: Got it. So that includes the U.S. where newbuilds have been fairly slow the last few years?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. That does.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of David Guarino with Green Street.
David Guarino: I was wondering if you could provide any updates on Oi. And specifically, I was wondering if you have any updates on the land underlying I think it was around 2,000 sites in Brazil that are up for renewal in ‘25, feel like there's a lot of moving pieces. So just trying to understand if there's any risk of loss revenue from those sites?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. There's -- now you're talking about the concession sites, I think, from the acquisition that we did. Yes. No, there's really not, and we expect that we'll -- those will actually be continued on. And actually, those leases extend out, I believe, longer than that with us as a commitment from Hawaii that goes out beyond the...
Jeffrey Stoops: Two-thirds to 2035, I believe.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. That transaction is supposed -- now the latest thinking is that, that doesn't get consummated until sometime next year. And then with the network rationalization aspects that come out of that not starting until sometime in 2023.
David Guarino: Okay. Maybe switching gears then, going back to an earlier question about you guys talking about DISH as part of the Big 4 carriers. Does that mean that you're going to update your customer concentration table to reflect DISH once the revenue starts commencing on the tower sites?
Jeffrey Stoops: Sure. Yes, of course.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, once they reach a level, I mean that -- we're giving the concentrations above 10% of revenue. Obviously, they'd have to achieve that. Their contributions to leasing activity are significant and on par with the other carriers now. But obviously, the total sum of revenue, considering they're starting at zero, is at a much lower percentage. So we ultimately will do that if they achieve that level of contribution.
Operator: And our final question in queue at this time comes from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brandon Nispel: Great. Two questions. One, could you comment just on leasing PG&E assets. Any additional comments you could provide there? I don't think anybody asked. And then on the balance sheet, I think you guys called out blended interest costs of 2.25% or so and then some incremental run rate savings. Could you -- what else is to be done there going forward? Do you guys see interest expense coming down?
Jeffrey Stoops: PG&E is ahead of plan, benefiting from all of the U.S. activity from all the contributors that we earlier discussed in general. So we're extremely pleased with that. And...
Brendan Cavanagh: On the balance sheet, the -- just to correct what you said, the average interest rate is now on a pro forma basis, 2.6%. There are potentially some other possibilities. We obviously have maturity dates that come up over the next several years. Really, we'll have to see where interest rates are as we hit those dates. There's probably some opportunity to refinance and have some additional improvement, but I think we've done the vast majority of that now with the last deal that we just completed this past month.
Jeffrey Stoops: Ryan, is that it? Or is there another question?
Operator: We have no further questions in queue.
Jeffrey Stoops: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this evening, and we look forward to reporting our fourth quarter sometime in February. Have a great day.
Operator: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. I'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Call. [Operator Instructions] 
 As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead. 
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Caroline. 
 Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. 
 Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2021 and beyond. 
 In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, August 2, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. 
 In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. 
 And with that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks, Mark. Good evening. 
 SBA had a tremendous quarter with results for the second quarter, ahead of our expectations in most key areas. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $524.1 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $514.6 million. Foreign exchange rates were ahead of our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, contributing $3.1 million of incremental site leasing revenue in the second quarter. They were also a tailwind in comparison to the second quarter of 2020, positively impacting revenues by $3.5 million on a year-over-year basis. 
 Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.4% over the second quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.5% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 5.9%. 
 Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 5.5% on a gross basis and 3% on a net basis, including 2.5% of churn. 
 Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter was up significantly from the prior quarter and represented the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of execution, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog finished the quarter at a multiyear high. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the balance of this year. 
 During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 34% of our domestic bookings with 66% coming from new leases, the first time in many years the bookings from new leases outpaced that from amendments. 
 The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 97% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. 
 Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.3% net, including 2.2% of churn or 7.5% on a gross basis. International leasing activity increased modestly from the first quarter. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had an improved quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 8.9% on a constant currency basis. 
 During the second quarter, 84.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.4% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. 
 Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $421.2 million. Our tower cash flow margins continue to be very strong, with a second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.7% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.8% or 91% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. 
 Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $400.2 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. 
 During the second quarter, our services business produced record results for the company with $51.4 million in revenue and over $11 million of segment operating profit. The very high activity levels we saw in the first quarter strengthened further in the second quarter, resulting in a quarter end services backlog that was 30% above first quarter levels and was also the highest in our company's history. We expect to see continued high levels of services activity throughout the rest of the year, and as a result, have increased our full year outlook for site development revenue by $25 million from last quarter and by $40 million from our initial outlook. 
 AFFO in the second quarter was $293.5 million. AFFO per share was $2.64, an increase of 15.3% over the second quarter of 2020. 
 During the second quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 57 communication sites for total cash consideration of $67 million. We also built 98 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or agreed to purchase approximately 400 additional sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $95 million, and we anticipate closing on the majority of the sites under contract by the end of the year. 
 In addition, during the second quarter, we announced that through a new joint venture arrangement, we have entered into a contract with Airtel Tanzania, a subsidiary of Airtel Africa, to purchase their approximately 1,400 towers in Tanzania. Under this agreement, Airtel will lease back space on each of the towers and will also provide a fixed minimum number of build-to-suit towers during the first 5 years following the closing of the acquisition. 
 The total purchase price for the acquisition is expected to be approximately $175 million, and the acquisition is anticipated to close in stages starting in the fourth quarter. For our updated 2021 outlook, we have assumed that the acquisition closes at the end of the year, and thus, we have included the entire purchase price in our outlook for discretionary capital expenditures, but we have included no revenue or tower cash flow associated with these events. 
 We expect the assets to produce approximately $18 million of adjusted EBITDA during the first full year of operations under the joint venture. SBA will be the majority partner of the joint venture, and we are partnering with Paradigm Infrastructure Limited, a U.K. company founded by former senior executives of American Tower, which is focused on developing, owning and operating shared path of wireless infrastructure in selected growth markets. 
 We believe the combined international tower industry operating experience of SBA and Paradigm will allow us to maximize the opportunity in this new rapidly growing market. 
 In addition to new tower assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.8 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years. 
 In this afternoon's earnings press release, we included our updated outlook for full year 2021. Our updated increased expectations for site leasing revenue, site development revenue, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. These increases are driven by outperformance across our business, increased network investment activities by our customers, improved foreign exchange rates, reduced nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures and reduced cash interest expense as a result of timely refinancings. 
 Notwithstanding our strong domestic leasing bookings during the second quarter, which were ahead of our expectations, we have not increased our 2021 outlook for incremental organic domestic leasing revenue. New bookings typically begin to accrue revenue at the earlier of a date certain or commencement of construction. For outlook purposes, unless we have received notice of construction commencement, we only consider the date certain, which, for the second quarter bookings outperformance generally ranges from late in the fourth quarter to sometime in the first half of 2022. 
 As we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate our reported gross domestic same-tower revenue growth will begin to increase in the second half of the year and that we will exit 2021 at the highest rate of the year. As is always the case, our full-year 2021 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today, and the outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today. However, when opportunities present, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the rest of the year. 
 Our outlook for net cash interest expense does not contemplate any further financing activity in 2021. 
 Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of 111.5 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. 
 With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet. 
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. 
 We ended the quarter with $12 billion of total debt and $11.7 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3x, a return to our target range of 7 to 7.5x, faster than originally anticipated after the PG&E acquisition during the first quarter. 
 Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.4x. On May 14, the company, through existing trust, issued $1.165 billion of secured tower revenue securities Series 21-1c, which has an anticipated repayment date of November 9, 2026, and a final maturity date of May 9, 2051. These securities have a fixed annual interest rate of 1.631%, payable monthly. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2017-1c tower securities and for general corporate purposes. 
 Then on July 7, the company amended its existing revolving credit facility. Among other things, this amendment increased the total commitments under the facility from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion; in addition, extended the maturity date of the facility to July 7, 2026; lowered the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees under the facility; and incorporated sustainability-like targets into the facility, allowing for interest rate and commitment fee adjustments based on how we perform against those targets. We are pleased to be one of the first companies to include such sustainability-focused provisions in our credit facility. 
 As of today, we have no amounts outstanding under our revolver and the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt is 2.9% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.5 years. 
 During the second quarter, we did not purchase any share of our common stock. As of today, we have $475.1 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase price. The company's shares outstanding at June 30, 2021, were 109.5 million compared to 111.9 million at June 30, 2020, a reduction of 2.1%. 
 In addition, during the second quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $63.5 million or $0.58 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.15 per share, which is payable on September 23, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 26, 2021. Today's dividend announcement represents a payout ratio of 22% of second quarter AFFO per share, which leaves us ample room for material future dividend growth. 
 And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone.
 As you have heard, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter, one of our best in quite some time. Domestically, our customers were extremely active. This quarter, we signed up more new leasing revenue than we have in any quarter in 7 years. We believe the second quarter was the start of a multiyear increase in U.S. wireless carrier CapEx. 
 Our backlogs of lease and amendment applications ended up near record highs at the end of the quarter, notwithstanding the high levels of bookings, which obviously bodes well for activity levels throughout the rest of the year and into next. 
 Our customers are focused on building out their 5G networks with a particular focus on upgrading their macro networks. Leasing activity levels were driven by initial C-band initiatives, 2.5 gigahertz deployments, FirstNet amendments, general coverage expansion and the beginning of DISH's network build-out. These initiatives also drove our services volumes to record highs. 
 Last quarter, I was pleased to discuss how our first quarter services results were the best in 7 years, but that didn't last long as we reported 18% more services revenue in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter, producing over $51 million of quarterly revenue, the highest in our company's history. We also finished the quarter with the highest services backlog in our history. These results allowed us to increase our full-year services outlook by $25 million. As you could tell, our domestic customers are very busy right now. That sets us up for a very good 2021 and 2022. 
 Internationally, the second quarter was also very solid for us, with quarter-over-quarter sequential increases in new lease and amendment executions and increasing CPI-based escalators in a number of our markets. During the quarter, we signed up 45% of new international revenue through new leases and 55% through amendments to existing leases. Our increased leasing results were driven by our 2 largest markets, Brazil and South Africa. These markets are still being affected at a greater level than here in the U.S. by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Our local teams, though, continue to perform very well and we believe we remain well positioned to benefit from increased network investment from our carrier customers as conditions improve and new spectrum auctions take place over the next year, including, for example, the just completed 3.5 gigahertz auction in Canada, which raised proceeds well above expectations. Similar options of 5G-suitable spectrum are planned in the near term in a number of our markets, including Brazil. 
 Even with this positive momentum, perhaps the most exciting international news from the quarter was regarding our pending acquisition from Airtel Tanzania. We have partnered with Paradigm Infrastructure for this opportunity. Paradigm was founded by and is run by several former American Tower executives well known to us, including those that were responsible for their initial African expansion and operations. Paradigm will be both the financial investor and an operational partner in this venture. 
 As a market, Tanzania provides many opportunities. The country has a large growing population and has consistently produced good GDP growth, and the new president has indicated a greater commitment to policies that encourage foreign business investment. Despite Tanzania's growth, the mobile penetration rate is still only 41% today, creating significant opportunity for incremental wireless investment and expansion. 
 The wireless market is predominantly made up of 3 major carriers who are relatively well balanced in terms of market share, Vodacom, Airtel and Axian, who recently bought Tigo's operations in Tanzania. Each of these MNOs are focused on expanding their infrastructure in Tanzania. Airtel will be using a substantial amount of the proceeds from the sale of its sites to increase CapEx spending. 
 Likewise, Axian is an African-focused and experienced operator whose plans include a strong investment in the country to improve the existing Tigo network. We are purchasing Airtel's approximately 1,400 wireless towers, which have a current tenancy ratio of just under 1.5 tenants per tower, including Airtel, and the majority of the existing revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars.  Approximately 3/4 of the sites are located on the power grid. And for those that are not requiring provision of energy, the cost will be passed through to the tenants. 
 We believe there will be opportunities to not only organically grow our revenues on existing towers, but also to expand our tower portfolio in Tanzania, including through a build-to-suit commitment from Airtel over the next 5 years, which was part of the transaction. The combination of our partnership with Paradigm, the attractive price paid for the assets and the growth characteristics of the Tanzanian market support our belief that this will be a value-creating new market for SBA in the same way we have created material value in South Africa and Latin America on a country-specific basis without any requirement for further regional or geographic expansion. We're very excited about this new SBA market. 
 In addition to our strong second quarter operating results, our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We ended the quarter at 7.3x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5 turns, 1 quarter after absorbing the large first quarter PG&E transaction, demonstrating the ability of our business to rapidly organically delever. 
 During the quarter, we completed a new asset-backed financing at the lowest fixed cost interest rate for any non-equity-linked security in our history. Shortly after quarter end, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by $250 million and extended the term. These activities continue to drive our liquidity position higher and our weighted average borrowing cost lower for the first time below 3% to 2.9%. 
 We have no debt maturities until 2023, and we continue to have access to low-cost debt with additional opportunities to continue to improve our overall cost of debt financing. Our liquidity position and balance sheet and our approach with regard to leverage have allowed us to drive incremental AFFO per share and incremental value for our shareholders. We feel really good about our capital structure. 
 Things are going very well right now here at SBA. Our customers are pleasing. Our financial position is strong, and our team members are the best in the industry. We are excited about the opportunities that lay ahead. 
 I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and their contributions to our success, and we look forward to sharing our results with you as we move through the year. 
 And with that, Caroline, we are ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. 
Ric Prentiss: A couple of questions. First, obviously, PG&E was a big transaction. We saw a story come out in the last few weeks that they plan to bury like 10,000 miles of electric line. Is there going to be any changes to the sites you've got, where they might be taking electrical lines down, making it obviously easier to couple on them? And what kind of interest activity have you seen on those sites? 
Jeffrey Stoops: We've seen great activity. We're ahead of plan, and there's a lot of demand in terms of application backlogs. 
 And in terms of that story, Ric, that relates primarily to the lower wood poles, the ones that are closer to the end user as opposed to the high-power transmission poles that are the ones that were really are part of our transaction. 
 So we don't see a lot of issues related with that. But if, in fact, there are poles or assets that were part of our transaction, there's a fairly elaborate -- if anything should happen to those in terms of being no longer needed or used by PG&E, there's a fairly complex set of rules that deal with that. So something that we're covered on and feel very good about. But for the most part, it's going to be the shorter wood poles that they're talking about. 
Ric Prentiss: Makes sense. Okay. Also, the Tanzania joint venture, one of your peers recently, doing a big private equity transaction in Europe, has started giving consolidated AFFO per share as well as attributable to common AFFO per share. 
 Have you guys considered, as now you get a little more joint ventures going, that you might move to, obviously, EPS stories. They are -- always take out minority interest. But any thought about moving towards a measure of a more proportionate AFFO to common? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Ric, to this point, obviously, nothing has been material enough to do that. We do always back out -- we've previously identified when we haven't consolidated something. Obviously, the JV piece of the AFFO per share. But it's something we'll look at. If it becomes material, we'll highlight it for you guys. We just haven't had any, really, to date. 
Ric Prentiss: Makes sense. Final one, obviously, we make that adjustment from AFFO to funds available for distribution. We've been watching, I think you guys call it, amortization of capital contributions, which is still very low. I think it was $13 million in the first half of this year, $33 million all of last year. One of your peers has almost 20x that level of noncash items that get put into AFFO. 
 Any thoughts of any changes coming from you that would take it up higher? Or is it fairly low? Because it's obviously one of the big noncash items that kind of is different between the tower companies. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean I don't think so, Ric. The things that would drive it up is obviously more augmentation activity of the towers, which is certainly possible, given the increased amount of activity in general that we're seeing. But the offset to that is that as we have longer terms to our leases, particularly the Verizon MLA, which we talked about last quarter, and some of the new agreements that come with longer term, that tends to stretch out the period over which you're amortizing and actually reduces the amount. 
 Plus just -- it's a factor of which towers are getting hit, whether work needs to be done at the site, how much cost is being reimbursed, all those kind of things. So I don't expect it to actually move up materially at any point in the next year or 2. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. It's very different, Ric, when you're not doing small cell fiber work where it's more common that your customer contributes a large amount of the initial CapEx upfront, then you amortize it into that amount. I mean, that's never really been a big issue in the macro tower side of the business other than just the regular augmentation stuff, which is -- we don't foresee any material changes in that. 
Ric Prentiss: Makes sense. Obviously, I always like going back to cash and the ability to pay dividends. So I appreciate that, and you guys stay well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. 
Simon Flannery: I was wondering if you've had any more clarity from T-Mobile about their plans for the Sprint towers. Do you think the churn is going to be consistent with the current contracts? Or do you think there's the potential to either keep some of those towers or have them pushed out? 
 And any updates on the Oi restructuring and how we should think about the impact maybe opening up the potential for more investment in Brazil once that goes through? 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. In terms of the T-Mobile-Sprint question, Simon, T-Mobile is very organized and very, I think, ahead of what people thought in terms of their network planning. So there's a lot of crisp communications going back and forth. But I don't know that it materially has changed our prior statements on what we expect in terms of decommissioning. And we don't have any additional news on the uptake of the potential Sprint sites. But I would just say that T-Mobile is very prepared in their work in this area. 
 In terms of Oi, I believe the latest is that we're not expecting anything until at least the fourth quarter of this year, maybe into next. And our prior statements in terms of our exposures to both -- or to all 3 of TIM, Tigo and Claro, those have not changed. 
Simon Flannery: Okay. Great. And do you think there's an opportunity for you to do more on build-to-suit? I think you did about 100 in the quarter. And then it sounds like it's part of the Tanzania story as well, but you haven't done a huge amount relative to what we've been hearing from some of your peers. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. I think there's always an opportunity. The question is does it represent the terms and the financial returns that we're looking for. I think the universe of opportunities would allow us to do more. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. 
Philip Cusick: It's Phil Cusick. Start with the Paradigm deal. Was this the team you worked with from South Africa? Or is this a different team? 
Jeffrey Stoops: No. We didn't work with any of the AMT guys in South Africa, Phil. This is Steve Marshall and Hal Hess and Steve Harris, guys that I've known forever. And worked very closely with Steve Marshall at WIA. So that's really just through the industry, this all came together. 
Philip Cusick: Okay. What's your potential capital commitment over time for this? 
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, it's not much beyond the $175 million. I mean, Brendan what's... 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, that's the total purchase price, the $175 million plus a few incremental costs. So that represents everything. So it wouldn't be materially more than that. I mean down the road, we'll have to see how things... 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. I mean we've modeled in some upgrade CapEx and some refurbishment CapEx, but talking about material numbers there as well. 
Philip Cusick: Okay. It just sounds like if you're going to do something like this in a whole bunch of new countries, it's -- I would think you have a sort of number that you'd be willing to invest alongside them to make these more interesting over time. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. The JV, Phil, is specific to Tanzania. There's no obligation to do anything alongside them going forward. So there's no commitment as far as that goes. 
Jeffrey Stoops: If we could find more opportunities like Tanzania, though, we'd be excited. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. 
Michael Rollins: With respect to the domestic leasing activity that you were highlighting just earlier in the call, how does this compare with the internal expectations that you've had? And what does this mean to the levels of gross leasing growth that you can achieve in the domestic business over the next couple of years? 
 And then just separately, I just wanted to follow up on another thing that was said earlier. I was just curious if you could unpack why the mix of leasing activity had a greater amount of new sites versus amendments in the domestic business? 
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, the last one is an easy one to answer, Mike, and it's DISH. Because DISH is coming online in the form of entirely new leases, and they're very busy. So that's the answer to that. 
 In terms of the second quarter, we achieved results that were ahead of our expectations. We did have some fairly robust expectations, but even those were exceeded by the level of second quarter activity. 
 And in terms of the growth rate going forward, I don't want to get too specific other than to say it's going up. 
Michael Rollins: In the past, I think, and you can correct me if I don't have this right, were you talking, I think, high single digits of where you expect the gross domestic growth to get over the next few years? I'm just curious if you could just revisit that perspective. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Mike, from a growth standpoint, we certainly expect it to be mid- to high single digits in the future given what's going on now. So yes, when you're talking about going out a lot of years, obviously, we're getting bigger and bigger, so you have to add that many more dollars to make that happen. But given the activity levels today, I think as we get a year or so out, you'll start to see us return to levels that are similar to what we've reported in the past when we were busier. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. 
Nicholas Del Deo: First, for the question that Mike just asked, it sounds like DISH was really an outsized contributor to leasing this quarter. Can you just -- if you back that out, can you talk about how activity from the big 3 carriers, in particular, has changed over recent quarters? Was it DISH in particular that really drove the outperformance in leasing versus your expectation? Or was that outperformance more broad-based? 
Jeffrey Stoops: I would say that the ones that had kind of step function changes in their levels of activity were DISH and Verizon. And the Verizon story is very understandable. It's coming off the C-band auctions, their public statements and our MLA with them. 
Nicholas Del Deo: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then one on Tanzania and the partnership with Paradigm, do you have an option to eventually buy out their stake or vice versa? Or is there no mechanism in place to do that? 
Jeffrey Stoops: No, there is a mechanism that gives us the right to buy them out. 
Nicholas Del Deo: Can you talk about the time frame or any other parameters? Or is that proprietary? 
Jeffrey Stoops: It's not proprietary. It's 5 years-ish. Might be a reason why it gets accelerated a year or extended a year, but that's generally the time frame that we're looking at. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. 
Brett Feldman: Following up a little bit on C-band. Now that you're starting to see what some of the carriers are doing with C-band, how much visibility do you have and to the extent to which that's mostly going to be a significant amendment project versus any visibility into a new site project? Because for all of the operators that you already have as tenants are on 1 C-band. This would be a higher frequency than anything they've ever historically used on a macro site. So it would apply that they might need densification, but I don't know if you have that visibility at this point in time. 
 And then just following up on the services backlog, I'm just curious, is all of that services work being done on your towers, meaning is it a fairly good leading indicator of what your own leasing is? Or are you actually winning a degree of the business across other portfolios as well? 
Jeffrey Stoops: The answer to your last question is yes. It is mostly all on our towers, which is why we have the confidence we have. 
 And in terms of your first question, Brett, there will be some leases in there. But for T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T, it's going to be mostly amendments. And for DISH, it's going to all be new leases. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk from LightShed. 
Walter Piecyk: Jeff, I'll preface this question by noting that last quarter, your average -- price of your share repurchases, I think, $258, and the stock is now $340 or $342. But in this quarter, you didn't buy anything. 
 So I'm just kind of curious, is this -- I mean, I know this acquisition was, whatever, $175 million, is kind of in the ballpark of what you spent last quarter. Is that the connection that we should draw? Or is it maybe where the stock price is in terms of the activity this quarter? 
Jeffrey Stoops: No. We wanted to come down off the 7.6%, and we came down quicker than we thought. And by the time we knew that, we were blacked out. 
Walter Piecyk: Got it. And then on the domestic ramp, when you look at your guidance for new lease activity, it's obviously very high, so there's going to be a ramp. Can you give us a sense of Q3 versus Q4? 
 I mean obviously, we're going to have to see some type of jump in Q3, but is the bigger jump really going to occur in Q4 in terms of the new lease activity? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. You're talking about the same-tower growth rate, Walt, alright? Yes. 
Walter Piecyk: Yes, right. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We expect it to step up sequentially each of the next 2 quarters, but certainly, the fourth quarter would be a bigger step-up is our expectation based on the timing of when this -- the stuff we're signing... 
Walter Piecyk: Orders and stuff came in, yes. That makes sense. And then, I mean if -- T-Mobile is got to be a component of that. I mean, doesn't this kind of speak to the timing of how their integration is going, if it's still like more of a Q4 event? 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. I mean they're busy. They're busy and... 
Walter Piecyk: But they're not getting them activated in Q3, right? It's still not happening until Q4 for them. 
Brendan Cavanagh: They're getting stuff activated in Q3 as well. So I mean, it's a mix question, Walt, but they're busy in activating stuff in both -- we expect in both quarters. 
Walter Piecyk: It's just interesting given that C-band is right around the corner for Verizon, and they're still kind of back-end loaded, but whatever. 
 And then international, that's also a big number. So that's going to be a big ramp second half, then, for international as well, right? To hit that $13 million target? 
Jeffrey Stoops: It will be a slight ramp. I don't know if I would call it a big ramp. we can walk through that number... 
Walter Piecyk: Slight relative to the overall company for sure, but for international -- for what your levels have been in the first half of the year, it seems like it's kind of big now? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. It's increasing. I mean, certainly, the lease-up has been a little bit better just recently, and we expect it to be better as we move through the year. I don't know that I would agree with your characterization, though, so we should probably talk about that separately. 
Walter Piecyk: Sure. Okay. One last one then, sorry. But T-Mobile's use of DISH's 600 megahertz spectrum, did that generate an amendment or a colocation or anything? 
Jeffrey Stoops: It will when it happens. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. 
Batya Levi: A couple of follow-ups. First, can you provide some color on the pacing of Sprint churn for this year? I think it was close to $2 million in the first quarter. How do we think about it for the rest of the year and maybe a color if that $13 billion still holds for next year? 
 And another question on the services side. The margins are coming in a little bit lighter than historical levels. Is there any opportunity to improve the services margins? And how do we think about the '22 services revenues? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Batya, on the Sprint churn piece, it's expected -- we had, I think, what we reported last time was about $1.7 million or so in the first quarter. We expect the full year to be somewhere between $8 million, maybe $8 million to $9 million or so for the year, the fourth quarter impact. And this is, again, on a full-year, year-over-year basis. Will be a little bit bigger because, obviously, there are some of those leases that are going away as we move through the year. 
 In terms of next year, right now, we still think maybe $30 million to $35 million or so is appropriate. I have to hedge a little bit only because the timing of when we get notice is, what they specifically decided to do, is a little bit of a fluid situation. But based on what we know today and lease expiration dates, that we think that's a reasonable estimate. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. In terms of the services margins, I mean, our services business is comprised of 2 distinct offerings. One is site acquisition, zoning, kind of soft work; and then the second is construction. Construction typically produces about half the margin of site ac and zoning. So the mix between site ac, zoning and construction is what drives the margin. And the margins have actually been, based on the type of work being provided, historically strong compared to QR experience. 
 In terms of next year, I mean, we'll give you next year's guidance when we get there, but there's no reason why the services business, because it is primarily on our own towers, should materially slow down. It's going to reflect leasing activity. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. 
David Barden: Just a follow-up on a couple of things. So I guess, first, Jeff, I think last quarter, when we were talking about the services business, you said you didn't see any reason for there to be a material change to Q-on-Q. Obviously, there was a change. 
 You kind of listed off a number of things that were contributing factors, but was it really like how quickly the C-band deployment came out of the gates? Or was it really how quickly maybe T-Mobile came out of the gates? Or was it just everything just turned out to be better than expected? 
Jeffrey Stoops: Really more of the latter. I mean C-band came out quicker. DISH came out quicker. T-Mobile continues to be extremely strong. 
David Barden: And just with respect to the disappointment, maybe you can comment on this, maybe you can't. But is it -- they've obviously publicly announced what their plan is, to build out the Vegas market. Is this the kind of bump that you saw specifically related to that? Or is there something grander that's going on that maybe we haven't heard about yet? 
Jeffrey Stoops: Our work is pretty well spread out, David. I'm not sure exactly how they geographically define those comments you made, but we're seeing a fair spread to the geography. 
David Barden: Okay, interesting. So just a couple of housekeeping ones. The Tanzania contract, is that all denominated in shillings? 
Brendan Cavanagh: The purchase price? Are you asking about the purchase price or the leaseback? 
David Barden: The leasing, the leasing contract. 
Brendan Cavanagh: It's roughly -- well, this includes the other third parties, so I don't know the exact breakdown. But the total leasing revenue that's contracted is about 67% in U.S. dollars, when you exclude the pass-through stuff. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Most of the space is rented in U.S. dollars, the energy pass-through is all shillings. 
David Barden: Got it. Got it. Okay. Then my last one, if I could, sorry. The roughly $100 million, $95 million, that's not Tanzania that you guys invested. Where did you guys put that money this quarter? 
Jeffrey Stoops: I'm sorry, the what? 
David Barden: Sorry, the $95 million to $100 million that you guys -- that's not part of the Tanzania deal that got spent this quarter, where did that go? 
Jeffrey Stoops: The $95 million discretionary CapEx? 
David Barden: Correct. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, yes. Went into various acquisitions, also some new builds. We mentioned, we built about 100 sites during the quarter, so the total CapEx was up for a number of deals. The deals -- if you're asking where the deals were located, it was a mix. They were mostly deals in the U.S. in this quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. 
Eric Luebchow: I was wondering on AT&T, you didn't mention them as one of the customers that had a step-change function in activity. Have you seen any change from them since they announced the WarnerMedia spin-off around C-band urgency? 
 And you mentioned FirstNet as well in your comments. We have presumed that was starting to wind down, but maybe you could comment how much longer you expect FirstNet amendment to persist. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, AT&T is relatively steady. Did not have the same change in velocity that some of the others that we mentioned did. 
 And the FirstNet stuff, I think we are past -- well past the halfway point, but not close to being finished. 
Eric Luebchow: Okay. Fair enough. And just wondering, too, is there any update or anything to point out on SBA Edge, the data center platform, in terms of deal activity? And any update on timing when that could potentially become a modestly more material part of the business? 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. I believe, and I just heard this today internally that we've now gotten our third contract for a true mobile edge computing site, so that would give us 2 data centers and 3 or 4 mobile edge facilities. So moving forward, but quite a bit of ways away for reaching that materiality point you referred to. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen. 
Colby Synesael: You mentioned the JV's $175 million. I'm just curious what's your ownership stake of that. And why the JV? You obviously can afford to do that straight up on your own. Is that meant to signal some type of shift in strategies or simply they're the ones that brought the deal to you and therefore, were allowed to take a piece of it? 
 And then secondly, the new AT&T-DISH partnership. I'm curious if you view that as incrementally negative or positive to your business and I guess just the broader tower industry. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. The Paradigm folks were responsible for bringing the deal to us, Colby, and had a long relationship with Airtel in Tanzania with their former employer. So that's why we're where we are. I don't think we're disclosing the exact split, other than we are clearly the majority owner in all facets. 
 In terms of the AT&T-DISH deal, it doesn't really change DISH's requirements with the FCC, which is for their own fixed network. Arguably, it could impact their growth beyond that to just roll on AT&T's network. But we'll have to see. I mean, pruning never is the first economic choice. But I mean, it certainly hasn't in any way impacted DISH's case out of the blocks here in 2021. 
Colby Synesael: I just had a quick follow-up. One of the parts of that agreement is the ability for DISH to effectively give some of its spectrum to AT&T to deploy in its behalf, to which then, DISH can use. 
 Do you know if that would meet the threshold that the FCC has in terms of their 70% coverage requirement by 2023, i.e., they could effectively just go on AT&T's towers using their spectrum and that would meet the requirement wherever they may choose to do that? 
Jeffrey Stoops: I don't know the answer to that. 
Colby Synesael: Neither do I, but thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. 
Matthew Niknam: Just on capital allocation, now that you're back within your target leverage range, I'm wondering how you're thinking about that and how you're sort of prioritizing uses of excess cash post the dividend? 
 And then specifically on the M&A front as well, if you can talk about the latest you're seeing, both in terms of valuations and number of opportunities, particularly internationally. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, the number of opportunities internationally is high. Prices are high. You need to be very selective. I don't know that we will be able to do a bunch of things like we're doing in Tanzania. I hope we can, but I don't know that, that will be the case. 
 In terms of capital allocation, generally, we continue to believe our shareholders are best suited by a "lower dividend, higher dividend growth strategy". Gives us the most flexibility, produces very good growth numbers. So that's what we will continue to pursue there. 
 And given our access to capital and interest rates, we will look to stay fully invested within our target leverage range, whether that be portfolio growth or stock repurchases. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research. 
Jeffrey Kvaal: Yes. I guess, first, would you mind offering us an update on how close you are to bumping up against supply or labor challenges in this market? 
Jeffrey Stoops: So far, so good. We really haven't seen any issues on the labor side. I mean the fact that we maintain a sizable in-house crew gives us some flexibility there. 
 And in terms of the equipment side, we've not heard any issues around our customers delivering the equipment to the sites for installation. Now we read about all the same semiconductor issues that you read about, so I guess that could change, but it has not manifested itself so far. 
Jeffrey Kvaal: Okay. And then secondly, I think Brett asked earlier about potential for densification on the higher frequencies of C-band. What are you hearing from your carrier partners about their propensity to add some cells? Or do you think that they will figure it out with better antennas, et cetera, et cetera? 
Jeffrey Stoops: There'll be densification. But just like every generational upgrade, you go first to your existing sites because that's the quickest, the best bang for your buck. So this is happening exactly like it always does. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Guarino from Green Street. 
David Guarino: Can you remind us of the company's views on expanding into new markets and if there's any off limits? And then assuming you are open to expanding into new markets, how do you determine whether or not to utilize a JV partner? 
Jeffrey Stoops: The last part of your question is based on what they would bring to the table and mostly operational context as opposed to capital, at least so far. And in terms of -- there are certainly ones that are off-limits, either by choice or by legal necessity, places like Cuba and China. I mean, we're just not allowed to go there. 
 And then there will be others where the analysis of the risks outweigh the rewards. In a country where you have very little rule of law and you have the potential for nationalization of assets, those are not going to be markets where we're most excited about. 
David Guarino: That makes sense. And then how do you handicap the risk in those markets? And I guess, particularly with the Tanzania acquisition, is there a model you guys have internally that you use? Just with -- curious how you think about... 
Jeffrey Stoops: We look at all kinds of things. And when you get into markets in Africa, most of the work is not around the assets as much as it is around political, regulatory, tax, government. And we spend a lot of time and taking a lot of resources before we make those decisions. 
David Guarino: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one last quick one. On the unoccupied towers, the 28,000 as part of the PG&E transaction, is any activity from those sites showing up in your service revenue yet? Or is it still too early for that? 
Jeffrey Stoops: It wouldn't show up in our services revenue. The way that, that would -- that would be leasing revenue. I'm just not -- I know we have some interest. I don't know if we've actually booked anything or not. Do you know, Brendan? 
Brendan Cavanagh: I don't believe so. Not yet. 
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Brandon Nispel: You mentioned backlog a couple of times, Jeff. Can you quantify the year-over-year change in backlog of signed but not commenced new leases this quarter? 
 And then just more broadly on build-to-suit, one of your peers has large-scale build-to-suit program going on. Can you share with us how many towers you plan on building in Tanzania and maybe how you're thinking about build-to-suit more broadly over the next 2 to 3 years? 
Jeffrey Stoops: Brendan, do we have the answer to the last part? 
Brendan Cavanagh: I don't have the exact number for you, Brandon. It's materially higher, I can say, generally. But we can actually look for something to maybe put a percentage increase or something on that for you after the call. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. And in terms of the new-builds in Tanzania, we're committed to build hundreds of towers over the next 5 years. The hope is we increase that. 
 I would point to South Africa, which we -- which is now, I believe, over 1,500 towers, most of which were built. So there's a lot of opportunity there, and we will continue to press it in those areas where we think it's going to provide great returns. 
Brandon Nispel: And remind us what you are generally looking for in terms of returns from like an NOI yield perspective on build-to-suit sites. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, we're looking for towers that, ultimately, either with the first, although that's more unlikely, but with the second get to a 15% cash on investment yield or higher. 
 I want to thank everyone for tuning in today. And stay tuned, and we look forward to the next time we're together with third quarter results. Thank you. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience in holding and welcome to the SBA first quarter results call. At this time, all participant phone line are in listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. . Just a brief reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2021 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may include our future results or may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 26 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn the call over to Brendan to discuss our first quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you Mark. Good evening. SBA had a solid start to the year with first quarter results ahead of internal expectations for most of our key financial metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $505.1 million and cash site leasing revenues were $504.5 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the first quarter. They were however a significant headwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2020, negatively impacting revenues by $12.6 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.6% over the first quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.4% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 5.6% on a gross basis and 3.1% on a net basis, including 2.5% churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter was modestly lower sequentially than the prior quarter. But on the heels of our newly signed agreements with Verizon Wireless and Dish, we have seen substantial increases in our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlogs. These backlog increases are supportive of significant increases in domestic operational leasing activity throughout the balance of this year. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 77% of our domestic bookings with 23% coming from new leases. The big three carriers represented 86% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.1 billion of total debt and $11.9 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.6 times. This leverage ratio is elevated slightly above our target range of 7.0 to 7.5 times due to the PG&E acquisition during the first quarter. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.4 times. On January 29, the company issued $1.5 billion of unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2029. These notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.125% per year and interest is due semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2021. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fully redeem all the outstanding 4% senior notes, to pay all premiums and costs associated with such redemption and to repay the amounts outstanding at the time under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. As of today, we have $530 million outstanding under our revolver and the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt is 3% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.3 years. During the first quarter, we repurchased 654,000 shares of our common stock for $160.9 million for an average price of $250.33 per share. All shares repurchased were retired. As of today, we have $475.1 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 30, 2021 were 109.3 million compared to 111.6 million at March 31, 2020, a reduction of 2%. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $63.4 million or $0.58 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.58 per share, payable on June 15, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 20, 2021. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. As you heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid financial and operating results. Activities in the first quarter provides a foundation for the rest of 2021 and for the next couple of years. During the quarter, each of our largest domestic customers provided public disclosures expanding upon their 5G deployment plans making it clear with upgrades to their existing background network should be a key component of their network investment strategies over the next several years. We have begun to see direct evidence of this with significant growth in our leasing application backlogs and increasing volumes in our services business.
Operator: . First, we go to the line of John Atkin, RBC. Your line is open.
Jon Atkin: Thanks very much. So I was interested in whether you have seen any actual equipment installed on your U. S. towers? What kind is it, C-Band or L-Band variety? And then I had a kind of a bigger picture question about escalators which historically have been fixed and we get a lot of questions sometimes about why that could eventually become more CPI-based over time in kind of the core U.S. business? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: So on C-Band type things, I will just speak generically, Jon. Signed leases and amendments, yes, actually installs yet, no. And you shouldn't read anything more into that other than the typical time it takes to go from execution to installation. And on the fixed escalators versus variable, I mean that's an age old question. It obviously depends on which side of the historical inflation you fall as to what you prefer. It's been discussed and in every case that I know of that the U.S. is people have landed on a fixed escalator concept. So I don't know what really to tell you beyond it's a regular topic of discussion and fixed is the way folks have gone.
Jon Atkin: Got it. And then any more color you could provide on Brazil on just kind of macro topics, economy, carrier landscape, sector ?
Jeff Stoops: Brazil is strong still on progress. There is no question, the economy is feeling the effects like labor , employment rate Brazil is now currently around 15%. Our folks are optimistic that better times are shortly ahead. But we will need to see all that. I will say that notwithstanding the overall bleaker environment there, certainly compared to the U.S., our business and our operations continue to do just fine. So we are obviously thankful for that and communications continues to be a key need there and carriers continue to answer that need. But in general, everyone reads the same thing that I do and the same folks that I talk to, they still have some room to go in terms of improving their COVID position.
Jon Atkin: Lastly, just on the PG&E assets. Are there any kind of metrics around a portion of the portfolio that achieve a legitimate quality for lease up? What types of use cases you are finding when people do of these lease application? And just how to kind of think about the growth profile there?
Jeff Stoops: Well, obviously, all the ones that we talked about are in use. We have interest in some of the other 28,000 that are currently not in use. And the demand has been both for amendments by existing customers and new leases. So we are pretty pleased with how things have gone the first couple of months. Justin, I think we are ready for our next question.
Operator: Next up, we have Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.
Michael Rollins: Hi. Thanks and good afternoon. Just first, just following up on your comments regarding the activity levels, with the Verizon on the book and you have had a couple more months of discussions and activity, is 1Q the trough for domestic organic growth by leasing growth that was reported at 5.6%? And how do you think about what the peak range could be for this metric again, now that you have a couple more months of conversations and agreement? And then just secondly, are there any updates on the possible timing for merger-related churn relating to the T-Mobile and Sprint deal? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. Hi Mike. On the same tower growth rates, Q1 is certainly right around the trough. It's possible that Q2 also would be at a similar level based on what we have got in mind today. A lot, just as a reminder, that metric is a calculation based on the trailing 12-months. So it's really backward-looking and a lot of the significant increases we have seen in the organic leasing activity has just started to happen recently here. And so I expect that it will start to increase in the second half of the year and we will exit the year at a higher rate and frankly continue to increase as we move into next year. As far as how could it be, I can't really say for sure. I think on our previous call, we talked about on a net basis getting to mid single digits. I think that is certainly achievable. A big question mark is the timing of the churn which now leads to your third question, which is about the Sprint and T-Mobile overhang. The numbers that we gave on our previous call are still pretty much the same. We don't have, nothings occurred that would make us change our expectations. Just as a refresher, this year, we have about $8 million or so of impact to 2021 is what we are anticipating. We have already incurred a decent portion of that. So that's probably about the right number for this year. Next year is expected to be a little bit bigger, closer to $30 million of impact next year before it steps down the following couple of years to somewhere around $10 million to $15 million per year. And so we see the biggest impact potentially in 2025 and 2026. Having said all that, that's an estimate based on the timing of when those leases, the overlapping leases come up for their maturity date. It's certainly possible that T-Mobile plans will change in terms of what sites they need to keep. And so we will have to keep eyes on that and we will certainly inform you if anything changes.
Operator: Next up, we are going to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Phil Cusick: Hi guys. Thanks. Can you help us think about activity ramping from this year to next year as we go from the guided activity and talking about an exit run rate accelerating from here? I just want to pull the churn discussion out and really think about what activity could be doing?
Jeff Stoops: Well, it's clearly going to accelerate, Phil, as the C-Band spectrum is clear. Verizon themselves stated that one of the reasons for the team that was able to get ahead of the actual clearing and have the equipment already in place and ready to go. But I think as a practical matter, there will be a fair amount of just-in-time delivery of new C-Band equipment as it relates to when they get the spectrum cleared. And AT&T's commentary was that much of their C-Band spending is not even going to occur until beginning of 2022. So if you think what our customers have said at face value, we should move through this year and continue to grow as we move through 2022.
Phil Cusick: And if I were to assume 2019 as a good example of what happens when two carriers are really spending, do you think 2022 activity could be better than that $63 million or something that was in 2019?
Jeff Stoops: I mean it could. We don't want to too far ahead of ourselves but if you take your premise of all four carriers being very, very busy, I think 2022 will be that year.
Phil Cusick: Yes. Okay. Last thing, the service this quarter, just really strong. Anything that we should think of just sort of like a one-time or not repeatable in the second quarter? Or is that a good new run rate?
Jeff Stoops: I don't know how long to take it out, but there is nothing that we know of today as to why Q2 should be materially different.
Phil Cusick: Good. Thanks Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
Operator: Next, we have the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Your line is open.
Spencer Kurn: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the deal you struck with Verizon. One of your peers signed a more holistic deal where a certain amount of revenue was contracted annually and you guys didn't. So I was curious, why didn't you take that approach?
Jeff Stoops: We historically have thought it's best for all parties to operate on a more a la carte basis, Spencer. So you are correct. Our straight line only includes the results of the term extensions. It does not include any type of use rights, because that's a different deal. And that's just the way we historically have run the business and like to do things.
Spencer Kurn: Got it. And If I could just --
Jeff Stoops: I don't know if it's any more complicated than chocolate versus vanilla.
Spencer Kurn: Well, it's worked out favorably for you in the past. So we will have to see how things shape out. And one follow-up. In your prepared remarks, I think you said that you didn't include any benefit from the increase in your backlog that you saw this quarter because of the uncertainty around the commencement timing. Is it the case that you had already baked in some impact of the C-Band into the guide and the application that you saw this quarter basically met your expectation? Or is it the case that if these sites do commence, it could be incremental to your expectations that you laid out last quarter?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Hi Spencer. It's Brendan. We did certainly expect and included in our original guidance an increasing amount of leasing activity throughout the year. The backlogs are supportive of that. And the big question mark, which we did mention in our prepared remarks, it's just simply the timing of those applications turning into signed agreements and then the next step of the signed agreement getting dates at which the rents would kick in. And so we have got certain assumptions we have made around how that's going to play out. It certainly will be increasing as we move through the rest of the year, but that was already assumed. So to the extent that we are off at all and it is a little bit faster, I guess it could be higher. But I think as we get later in the year, the potential for that to be a material impact is very limited.
Operator: Next, we have the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Rick Prentiss: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon guys.
Brendan Cavanagh: Hi Rick.
Jeff Stoops: Hi Rick.
Rick Prentiss: We were all surprised with the cash taxes mentioned. How did you get there?
Brendan Cavanagh: You broke up a little bit. I think you are asking about the change in our cash taxes.
Jeff Stoops: Our cash taxes.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the cash taxes for the balance of the year, it's actually in part due to expected benefits that we have now from the PG&E acquisition in terms of amortization of that asset. That was not I think fully more when we gave the original guidance because that deal actually just closed right before we gave the last guidance. So that's something we are going to benefit from. Any other things that affected it are fairly minor differences in some of our international market. But PG&E was really the biggest difference.
Rick Prentiss: Because when we think longer term, how should we think about cash taxes will move around?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, obviously as a --
Rick Prentiss: I mean, they are going to go up.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. They are certainly going to go up. It's interesting because as a REIT, we obviously have limited federal cash taxes at any point, but there are currently state cash taxes that we do pay because we are not paying our full AFFO out as a dividend. So there is some opportunity to improve on that front. But on the other side, the more impactful thing will be our international taxes, which as we continue to grow in those markets and some of the depreciation shields run off, you will see the cash taxes in the international market decline.
Rick Prentiss: Makes sense. And how should we think about the CBRS opportunity? What's the timing and size available to put capital to work?
Jeff Stoops: The timing is now. The primary interest right now will come from municipalities, private networks. We are actually building some school systems to help bridge the digital divide that are focused on CBRS. And while some of our cable customers are also active, I think in terms of the national wireless carriers, they are going to focus really on the mid-band and use the CBRS stuff really as more of a niche solution for them. So the biggest opportunity is really, for CBRS in particular, are with outside of the national wireless carriers today.
Rick Prentiss: Makes sense. And then have you thought about giving us a table showing Sprint churn as far as colo versus other sites as more of your peers are doing the same?
Jeff Stoops: We haven't thought about it, but we will think about it.
Rick Prentiss: That would be great. All right. Thanks guys. Stay well.
Operator: Next, we have line of Batya Levi with UBS. Your line is open.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you. I think my first question ? How do you think this next big change organically be around maybe into next year or as C-Band becomes more of the mix down the road? And how does the amendment revenue compares to higher earnings? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Batya, you broke up on a lot of that. And I don't think any of the three of us here heard everything you said. Could you try that again?
Batya Levi: Sure. I was asking that about the amendment revenue mix. I think it was 77% this quarter. How do you think about that trending towards the year-end and maybe with the C-Band deployments becoming a bigger part of the mix? And  average in terms of how do these amendment revenues compare on a monthly basis now versus prior upgrades?
Jeff Stoops: Okay. The 77% and this is purely a guess, but I am going to guess it goes down as we hit year-end, mostly because all the Dish business is going to be new leases. So that's probably going to, to the extent it changes, it will be for that reason, because most of the other activity is from the other three carriers is definitely going to be amendments. And in terms of the pricing, we really never get into that. But I will tell you that based on load and usage basis, the pricing is entirely consistent with what our history has been.
Batya Levi: Okay. Got it. Maybe one quick follow-up. The new tower purchases 413, can you tell us where they were and how is the M&A activity in those markets?
Jeff Stoops: Those are actually under contract, most of those, Batya and they are mostly located internationally in existing markets of ours.
Batya Levi: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Barden: Hi guys. Thanks so much. I guess, a few questions. So on the services activity, in the past we have had one or two carriers being the driver of that. I guess how democratically distributed would you describe services activity running ahead of expectations at this stage? I guess the second question was just on this commencement question, Mark and some of the comments that John Stankey made about "skittishness" with respect to supply chain. Any observations, Jeff, maybe that you guys have from your perch as to how you see the probability, the confidence interval around accelerating activity give those questions for the same? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. On your last one, well, your first one, it's still not too democratically spread out. Our services revenues are still disproportionately coming from a few actors, which actually is good, because we have the opportunity to expand that base as we move through the year. In terms of your second question, we haven't really seen any supply issues yet, David. That's not to say, if somebody says that they are out there and they are, we haven't seen them yet. And in terms of what it's going to mean for us, as I think we have explained many, many times, once a lease or amendment is executed, when it actually begins to accrue revenue is the earlier of the date certain or when we actually install the equipment. So we are all rooting for fast equipment availability and dates of install that are earlier than the specified the end date in the contract. If that happens, we begin to accrue greater revenue earlier. But I mean right now, as we think about life and how this year and next year is going to play out, we are not really thinking about equipment delays.
David Barden: Okay. Great. And then if I could do one more follow-up. Just in light of the PG&E deal, obviously now that that's kind of ripened and closed, has there been an elevated or any amount of inbounds from other corners of the world looking to kind of do you have done? Or is that more a forced situation that was kind of unique?
Jeff Stoops: Well, PG&E had its own unique needs, but we have had many, frankly, inquiries from other utilities around the country.
David Barden: Okay. Good. Thank you guys.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks.
Operator: Next, we have the line of Nick Del Deo, MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.
Nick Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, returning to the PG&E sites. If you think back to other assets you have acquired that may not have been adequately marketed, is that's how long would it take them into kind of hit their stride and start seeing the benefits of being plugged into your sales engine? Was it basically right away? Or does it take a little time?
Jeff Stoops: No. It always takes time, always takes time. I mean six months to a year to really get to the point where it's just like a home-grown asset.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one on the M&A front. Obviously, a lot of talk of higher capital gains taxes this year. Would you expect that to potentially increase the pool of towers for sale in the U.S.? Or you are not hearing much on that front?
Jeff Stoops: It has historically, Nick. So I would expect it to do so again. But I don't know that the magnitude will be so great that it will be like a tsunami of deals. But clearly, there will be tax sensitivity, if the capital gains rates are increased.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. So maybe you pick up a few more, but not enough to really change the trajectory or anything?
Jeff Stoops: I wouldn't say we are going to get to 20% portfolio growth off the tax law changes.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you Jeff.
Operator: Next, we have Tim Long of Barclays. Your line is open.
Tim Long: Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, I think you guys mentioned something on CBRS and kind of digital divide and some benefits there. Could you talk a little more broadly about some of the government push for more rural broadband? And what do you think that might mean overall for your business? And then second, can you just update us on any updated developments on kind of the whole edge compute data center world where we know you guys are kind of kicking the tires right now? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. The government involved in broadband and bringing broadband to more rural areas is right in the middle of that, Tim. The initial bills have been mostly focused on fiber because they are trying to establish a minimum uplink and downlink speed which for fixed wireless today is not available. And there is a tremendous amount of lobbying going on right now to basically free that money for wireless as well as fiber and that all remains to be seen. In addition, the other aspect of the legislation that's been proposed is mostly for CapEx. And we have tried to make it clear, if you are industry channels that surely not CapEx that you need, there's a lot of CapEx out here. If somehow the relief could be structured in a way that guarantees rental payments and OpEx for periods of time, then I think you really have something that's going to be impactful for our industry. So the work that we are doing so far actually has not revolved so much on any federal programs. There is an ERIC program that is for education that is federally administered that's a part of it. But mostly we have been working with county school districts and actually private funding that's interested in economic development to make this stuff happen. So we are excited about the potential. What we have done to-date hasn't really involved much of any federal funding because that cake is still not baked yet. The edge compute, it continues to be a focus of ours. I continue to think it's going to bear a lot of fruit. We actually have two new customers and two new facilities that are under construction since our last call. But what really needs to happen, right and we have been very clear on this, I think from day one is, you need to have a use case world where you need computing power right at the cell site. And we are not there yet. I think we are going to get there. But until we get there, that's when you really want to know that the edge computing opportunity is a good one that we think it's going to be.
Tim Long: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we have Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Your line is open.
Walter Piecyk: Thanks. Jeff, I wanted to go back to Phil's question. He was drilling on 2022. But do you think 2022 is the peak year for colo and amendments?
Jeff Stoops: I don't know. I mean, we will see. It all depends on how quickly our customers want to spend. . You had AT&T saying, they are not really going to start their C-Band work until 2022. So I mean, it could be, but it also may not be.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. But I think, Phil, had you drilled down pretty nicely and it's $60 million versus $63 million, whatever. So you have good sense where 2022 is and how much of Verizon and now with Dish and stuff like that in there. So I am just curious if you think there's much left over to take that number even higher in 2023?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I would disagree that we know enough now to have 2022 fully baked and compare that to what ultimately will be the full build-out plans for our customers. It's going to be multi-year. It's not just a two-year gig. And it's not even really starting until late this year at the earliest. So the more we talk, the less I am prepared to say 2022 will be the time.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. And then Brendan, I think, when you were talking about, I mean the last two quarters you gave us a good sense of the churn that was ordered out at T-Mobile and Sprint. So I think you reiterated that $8 million-ish number, $9 million-ish whatever. But I think, Brendan, you also mentioned a lot of that has already been loaded in the first quarter. So was it a couple of million in Q1 of that $8million-ish or $9 million that has already kind of hit your numbers?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. It was a little less than $2 million. It was probably about $1.8 million or so. So, it will be a little bit bigger. So yes, I mean we saw a bunch of these releases that ended right at the end of last year, beginning of this year. So that piece we already knew about and then there are some other extra pieces that we are assuming happened that may or may not, but they are relatively small.
Walter Piecyk: So when you talk about, Brendan, the mid single digit growth, should we think about that including that Sprint number or Sprint Nextel or Nextel, T-Mobile number or is it after that?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Long term, the question I was answering was, what do we think it could get to in terms of being in a growth rate. So yes, that's a net number, but it's all --
Walter Piecyk: Including Sprint, because obviously that Sprint churns are going to start cranking up?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. But obviously in any given year, it could be higher or lower, because the Sprint churn is lumpy. So depending on the year, some years will be below that. And I guess conceivably it could be higher than that if you had really low churn and high lease up.
Walter Piecyk: I was just hoping it's like a Dave Schaeffer long term or it's like that number we are always waiting for. And then last question is on the Dish massive or Dish. Are they using massive MIMO antennas in terms of their new lease activity? Or are they using a more traditional approach?
Jeff Stoops: More traditional.
Walter Piecyk: Got you. Thank you very much.
Jeff Stoops: Sure.
Operator: Next, we have Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Brett Feldman: Yes. Thank you. Two questions, if you don't mind. We are talking a lot about C-Band and the historical conventional wisdom has always been higher frequencies are more useful in dense areas and less useful in less dense areas and your portfolio seems to skew a little more less dense. Now that you actually have insight from some conversations with carriers about how you are thinking about using the C-Band, what level of visibility or confidence do you have that they are actually going to go to all of the towers they currently use with you in markets where they hold C-Band licenses and upgrade and support C-Band? Or do you think there's some towers that won't fit and the other side of it, if you put your optimist hat on is, to what extent do you actually think they are going to increase their density if you begin going outside they maybe historically have not as they see that? And then the second question, if I just sort of think back on some of the earlier questions before, it sounds like you really haven't changed your approach to your leases. You are sitting with fixed escalators. You still like a la carte and there are some emerging operators who have signaled that maybe that has created opportunity for them that they have been able to get into some spaces where maybe you are not winning business because you haven't been as flexible. How have you gone comfortable with that trade-off that as you went through this vast iteration of major negotiations? It doesn't seem like you really budged a lot.
Jeff Stoops: Well, I would put out our historical results as the reason why we are comfortable with that and our first quarter results and where we will be this year and where we will be next year and kind of leave it at that. In terms of your first question on density, I think we have seen enough so far to know that it's going to be fairly broad. I mean I would never tell you to count on 100% of their release. But it is going to be broad. It's going to be closer to a 100% than it is to 50%. And we won't really know, I think, until we get into it a little bit, particularly with the existing carriers as to how much new leasing will come about this because clearly they are all pursuing colocations first because that's faster, cheaper, it's just a smart way to go about it. And it will be a little bit of time before we see the demand for new leases. But it would be like anything else. I mean if the demand is good enough and there's money to be made, they are going to collocate.
Brett Feldman: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Eric Luebchow: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on that last point. You mentioned in the Verizon deal, there were some parameters around new site builds. And it seems like recently the big three wireless carriers haven't done as much with the public towerco's on new builds. So do you see an opportunity beyond just the initial amendment activity for new sites, either with Verizon or any of the other carriers? Or is it just too early to tell at this point?
Jeff Stoops: No, we definitely see an opportunity and this agreement will facilitate that.
Eric Luebchow: Okay. Great. And then just one more for me. I am just wondering in the initial discussions with the C-Band winners, your large customers, have you have seen any amendment opportunity beyond the C-Band radios, perhaps then looking at lower frequency spectrum upgrades to support uplink to allow them to get better propagation out of the mid-band spectrum?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I mean there is a variety of requests and equipment contents that go about this. It's not just strictly C-Band radios. A big part of this is the massive MIMO antennas. That's different than what your question was, but we are seeing a whole variety of different things here, of which really the unleashing of the C-Band has now given everybody the reason to go back to the macro networks that they knew was coming. So here we are.
Eric Luebchow: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Your line is open.
Colby Synesael: Hi. Great. Thank you. I appreciate with the Verizon MLA that there is not a use case. I am curious in deals like that, if you put in place some type of an incentive to potentially go on to X amount of their sites faster than otherwise and if, for example, they do that they get pricing lower than they might otherwise. I am just curious if there is those types of structures and deals? And then secondly --
Jeff Stoops: Yes. We do have an incentive, Colby. And you say deals like this. I mean this is the first global master agreement we have ever done for Verizon.
Colby Synesael: Okay. But I guess, to your point, there is an incentive that if they go into X amount of sites by X amount of date, it would be more cost effective on a per site basis than if they took longer?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. X amount, X price, X date equals X discount.
Colby Synesael: Got it. And then secondly, Brendan, I am curious if there's any more refi opportunities? Obviously, that was nice savings. And then lastly, I am just curious what drove the AFFO beat? I think that's where in terms of revenue, EBITDA, AFFO, that's where we saw the biggest beat and if I just take your first quarter number and annualize that, that already gets me to the midpoint of your 2021 guidance. Just curious if there's anything one-time in there? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Hi Colby. So refi opportunities, there definitely are opportunities without doubt. We have some debt that is reaching points where it can be refinanced. And based on the current market environment, we would expect to be able to refinance it at better rates than we are currently paying on several of those instruments. So I would just say, stay tuned since we are constantly looking at that and I would expect us to take advantage of those opportunities. On the AFFO beat, I think you are referring to, basically, our increase in our outlook for, in addition to the beat. But yes, I mean, I guess they are one-timers in some sense. One of the main contributors was in the services area, which we already talked about. We actually had a very strong quarter. So the margin contribution from services was very high. That's not a recurring business. So I guess you could call it one-time. But we do expect to continue to see a similar level of activity throughout the year based on the backlog that we have. We also --
Colby Synesael: And then get to that point I just, sorry and I guess I think Phil Cusick asked this, but are you seeing a similar margin profile for that as well?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes.
Colby Synesael: Okay.
Brendan Cavanagh: We are. And that is subject to shift a little bit depending on the mix side type work versus construction. Construction is typically a little bit lower margin. But as of right now, most of the work that's happening is a lot of it's pre-construction. So I would expect that to stay similar. And as we get toward the latter part of the year, you would probably start to see more construction work and so maybe the margin starts to shift down slightly at that point.
Jeff Stoops: So the projects have much higher volume.
Brendan Cavanagh: They have higher volumes. That's right. And then, other contributions on AFFO, it was a couple of different things. We obviously had a little bit better cash taxes which we talked about on an earlier question. We also had lower non-discretionary CapEx than we had expected. We even lowered our guidance for the full year slightly for that as well. So it's a mix of each of those things. And frankly on the per share number, the share buyback helped a little bit as well in reducing our share count. So a mix of all those things.
Colby Synesael: Okay. And I mean I guess the point that I was at, when I look at your taking that number, I already got to the midpoint of your guidance. So it would seem that number should be going up through the course of the year.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean some of it's timing related. I mean we did do well in the first quarter in certain areas like the CapEx and frankly even our SG&A costs that we expect to be, both of those items to be a little bit higher as we move through the year. So some of it's just the timing issue. But overall, we were able to improve our full year guidance, in part because of the performance in the first quarter.
Colby Synesael: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next we have the line of Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brandon Nispel: Great. Two questions. Jeff, a question for you. Can you quantify the year-over-year change in the backlog of signed but not commenced new leases? And I guess when was the last time backlogs were this high? And the second question was around the minimum commitment that you would have with Dish. How do the minimum commitments trend throughout the life of the contract? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: While they do have certain time periods, which we are not going to disclose. So there's X business by Y day. And so it's broken out in more discrete periods over the contract. So there is definitely incentives and commitments to move things along during the life of the lease. In terms of the dollar volume on the backlogs, we generally internally talk about backlogs in terms of the number of amendments and the number of leases. And where we are today versus where we were a year ago, which is, remember, we hadn't even got to the T-Mobile, Sprint and maybe we just got to the finish line right about now. I mean they are more than twice the size, but it's a different time.
Brandon Nispel: And I guess, when was the last time that backlogs was this high?
Brendan Cavanagh: It's been a few years.
Jeff Stoops: It's been a number of years.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean we have had periods. Obviously when you go back to the LTE upgrade, they were high. They probably were higher than they are now, although we are still building and that may very well be eclipsed in future here. But if you go back a couple of years ago when T-Mobile was particularly active, we saw some higher levels. But we are definitely at a high level by historical standards, even if it's not the highest and it's continuing to build, which is the most --
Jeff Stoops: Of recent times, yes. The LTE, the one thing we have made clear before is backlog from 3G to 4G, the average amendment prices was much higher, due to the heavy equipment nodes that were being added. We certainly expect volumes to rise with that. But pricing will be a little bit different this time within the less heavy additional weight loads that would be in question as part of the upgrades.
Brandon Nispel: Got it. Thank you for taking the questions.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Next will come from David Guarino, Green Street. Your line is open.
David Guarino: Hi. Thanks guys. A question for you on data center. So since the start of the year, we have seen a pickup in the number of transactions. Have you guys evaluated any other acquisition since the one last done in Jacksonville? And I guess what's the company's appetite to grow the data center footprint?
Jeff Stoops: We have a greater appetite, provided that it comes along with edge deployments at our cell sites. So as that continues to grow and as we continue to demonstrate the synergy between a regional data center and the MEC centers at our tower sites, which is what we are beginning to now experience in Jacksonville in particular, we would continue to look. We are very mindful of what we are though. We are wireless infrastructure company. And these regional data centers, if any, would be pursued only because of the success or the perceived success we will be having around the cell sites.
David Guarino: That's helpful. And is that just in the U.S. you would be looking? Or can we see you guys look internationally as well?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. The concept applies everywhere.
David Guarino: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the final question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam of Deutsche. Your line is open.
Matthew Niknam: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you give any more color in terms of the latest you are seeing from Dish and when we should anticipate them to maybe become a more meaningful driver for cash site leasing revenue growth in upcoming quarters? And then one housekeeping item, maybe for Brandon. If you can give us the contribution from a revenue and a tower cash flow perspective for PG&E in 1Q? And should we effectively double that into 2Q, given the full quarter? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Brendan?
Brendan Cavanagh: On the PG&E one, I believe the contribution was somewhere between $4 million and $5 million of tower cash flow and only slightly higher on the revenue side, because the costs are very limited there. And you should pretty much double that, because it closed pretty close to the middle of the quarter.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And on Dish, Matt, a lot of signed leases times 10 for application. So tremendous amount of activity. But whether we see revenue out of that this year will depend solely on how quickly Dish goes through the site acquisition, permitting and construction phase of things. And I can't give you anymore guestimate than what I have said because that's what it would be. That's what's going to drive revenue recognition this year, is the pace of the installs for Dish. But I mean it's all moving in the right direction.
Matthew Niknam: Understood. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. Thank you and thanks everyone for joining us. We think it's going to be a great year and we look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the presentation for this afternoon. We thank you for all your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. . And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2021 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations, our statements are as of today, February 22, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll now turn it over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. SBA had a very strong end to the year with fourth quarter results near the high end of our outlook for all key financial metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $493 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $492.8 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $3.5 million tailwind to revenues when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the fourth quarter. They were, again, however, a significant headwind on comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $17.7 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4% over the fourth quarter of 2019, including the impact of 2% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.4% on a net basis, including 2.3% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter, was at the highest levels of the year. We saw continued increased activity levels with T-Mobile during the quarter, and our domestic application backlog continues to grow. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity represented 88% of our domestic bookings, with 12% coming from new leases. The big three carriers represented 94% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.
Mark DeRussy : Thanks, Brendan. We ended the year with $11.2 billion of total debt and $10.8 billion of net debt. Our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.1 time. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA-to-net cash interest expense was 4.4 times. After year-end, on January 29, 2021, the company issued $1.5 billion of unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2029. These notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.125% per year, and interest is due semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning in August 1, 2021. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fully redeem all of the outstanding 4% senior notes to pay all premiums and costs associated with such redemption to repay the amounts outstanding at the time under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. As of today, we have $630 million outstanding under our revolver. And pro forma for the January unsecured notes issuance, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.7 years. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $480 million or an average price of $290.89 per share. Subsequent to year-end, we have repurchased 549,000 shares for $144 million or an average price of $262.16 per share. All the shares repurchased were retired.
Jeff Stoops : Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had a strong finish to 2020 with solid financial and operating results. The fourth quarter was our best quarter of the year in terms of organic leasing activity and services results, and we added a number of high-quality assets to our portfolio. We produced $2.49 of AFFO per share, or $0.01 short of an annualized rate of $10 per share. Our AFFO per share for the quarter represented material growth over the prior year period and demonstrates the value creation capability of this business. We also continued to invest in our company through material share repurchases, buying back 1.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and we did not slow down as we moved into 2021. Since year-end, we have signed up and closed on our large and exciting transaction with PG&E, repurchased an additional 0.5 million shares of our stock and signed up a master lease agreement with DISH. All of these activities will have long-lasting positive implications for SBA. We've demonstrated our ability over the years to find specific targeted opportunities where we can add assets at accretive prices and bring our expertise to bear in extracting and maximizing value. We're particularly pleased with the PG&E transaction. We've added a large number of high-quality, exclusive locations in Northern California to our portfolio at what we believe is an attractive price. We believe our experience and operational expertise will allow us to maximize the potential for wireless use of these assets for the benefit of both our wireless carrier customers and PG&E. With regard to our domestic leasing business, our customers are all turning their attention toward their 5G network investment plans. The significant investment in the current C-Band auction is evidence of the critical role that mid-band spectrum will play in the deployment of next-generation networks. And as a result, the importance of macro tower sites in the next wave of network investment. We believe it has been well settled that the primary use of C-Band spectrum will be on macro sites outside of urban markets.
Operator: Okay. . Our first question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Richard Prentiss: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Jeff Stoops: Hey, Rick.
Richard Prentiss: Hey, a couple of questions. Jeff, obviously, the PG&E transaction is a pretty major transaction. Can you walk us through a little bit about 2021 guidance? And how much revenue there is associated with the tower cash flow? I assume not much operating expenses at their sites. But then also take us down maybe to EBITDA because I'd also expect not a lot of below the line costs.
Jeff Stoops : You're right on both counts. Brendan?
Brendan Cavanagh : Yes. Rick, so if you look at our bridge for 2020 and 2021, we've got about $40 million of non-organic revenue coming in. I would say, the majority of that, $35-ish million of that, is coming from PG&E.
Richard Prentiss : Okay. And how about on the EBITDA area? Is it in that kind of $30 million, $35 million range on?
Brendan Cavanagh : Yes. It's within a couple of million dollars, because there's no -- the key thing is obviously the ground rent. They own the majority of land or have rights to it, so there's really no ground rent expense at all. So the margins are extremely high on this. So the vast majority of the revenue drops through to the bottom line.
Richard Prentiss : Makes sense. And then, Jeff, obviously, one of the big debates out there in the marketplace right now is the growth rates of -- in the U.S., same tower revenue, net organic cash, as we call it. Given the law of large numbers, churn, long-term, not to give you a $10 number like you had years ago, but can we get back into the mid-single digits? What's your view as kind of where the sustainable kind of long-term growth rate is in the U.S. side on a net organic cash basis?
Jeff Stoops : Yes. I do think we can get -- I don't know if we can get to double digits, but I do think we can get to upper single digits. I think what's happening this year is, if you think about it, you got a couple major carriers who are rumored to be heavy into the C-Band auctions, which means that there's going to be a lot to do. And if there's going to be a lot to do, you know there's going to be a lot to do, and you might push off what you can do today until tomorrow. And then you have one carrier in the name of DISH, who's already told you very clearly when they're going to start doing things, it kind of makes -- I think it's pretty clear as to the pace of things and the timing of things in 2021, but then it sets up for a very, very attractive 2022, particularly over 2021 comparable.
Richard Prentiss: Makes sense. And then how should we think about the churn impact? DISH also on their call today was talking about T-Mobile had given DISH notice that they would turn off the CDMA. I don't think they said VoLTE, but they said they would turn off the CDMA network January of 2022. How should we think about the T-Mobile-Sprint relationship you guys have? And what the churn outlook looks like?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Rick. So we've already -- I think we announced on our previous call that we've already received some non-renewal notifications from T-Mobile. And just to give you some numbers, for next year, 2021 being next year, that represents about $4 million to $5 million of the impact to our revenue loss. In addition to that, in our outlook, we expect, based on when leases come up and communications we've had already, that will probably be somewhere - an additional $3 million or so from them. As we look out over the future years, right at this point, we're basically measuring it based on where we have overlapping sites and what the timing is when those leases come up. That puts the majority of the terminations in terms of their financial impact for us in 2025 and 2026. We will see probably about 30% of the total exposure over the next three years.
Jeff Stoops : Yes. And obviously, we'll be well suited to talk to DISH about any of those sites that T-Mobile decides they no longer want.
Richard Prentiss: Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Stay well.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jonathan Atkin : Thanks very much. Yes. I just wanted to get a sense of some of the organic U.S. growth drivers this year that you alluded to around C-Band and DISH. Anything that you're seeing kind of so far this year around application activity that gives you a sense of when the timing would be around rent commencement? And then if you don't mind also addressing some of the smaller potential drivers, U.S. cellular, cable as well in the context of C-Band? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops : Yes. We really have not included any C-Band revenue in our 2021 guidance -- leasing guidance and the same with DISH. Now there certainly are arguments and optimism that, that could change, and things could happen where we do realize that, but it's not in there today, Jon.
Jonathan Atkin : Okay. And then on Rick's question about the Sprint T-Mobile, on the keep sites project, are you getting any sense as you think about churn and the guidance that you gave, but any variability around where you're getting to get informed about the sites to get kept as part of that? How does that kind of play into your thinking? And where are they in that process?
Jeff Stoops : Well, we've received quite a bit of information already, which we've been able to share with you on our outlook. But we're not -- we don't know that we've received at all.
Jonathan Atkin: Right.
Jeff Stoops: But we've had -- I mean, based on the timing of notices and things, I would tell you that I think we have the lion's share of the information already at this point.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay.
Brendan Cavanagh: As it relates to this year, as it relates to 2021.
Jeff Stoops: As it relates to 2021. Yes.
Jonathan Atkin : Got it. Any update on SBA Edge?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. We continue to have a number of opportunities that we're pursuing to actually move forward and tie. What we're focusing on, Jon, is the areas around the data centers to work on the direct ties between true mobile edge at the tower site type facilities, which have direct connections back, and we've got a number of different things that we're working on there. And we would just ask you to stay tuned there because we think there continues to be a lot of exciting opportunities and things that we can do there. But I think it's…
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you very much.
Jeff Stoops: …it will be not a material contributor to 2021.
Jonathan Atkin: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk : Hi, Jeff. On past calls, you and I have had these kind of dialogues about like timing of orders versus revenue and like how long it takes to execute. So just curious in terms of C-Band. Shouldn't you, by the end of the second quarter, have orders? If we -- if you should be able to get any type of revenue in calendar 2021, I mean, if not even by the end of this quarter. Can you just refresh our memory on the timing of that? Because the reason I ask, obviously, because Verizon is out there telling people, I think historically that, "Oh, yes, we can get C-Band built really quickly." And I think we have to back up to those days and actually see orders that's like 9 months, maybe more from when they would be activated and generating revenue for you? And prefer not to talk about a customer, just you can submit AT&T or T-Mobile or whatever. You know what the question is.
Jeff Stoops : It's not quite 9 months. Well, we probably have, at the absolute minimum 4 but more likely 6.
Walter Piecyk : Okay. So if we're to believe the ability to light up a C-Band market, then we should be hearing from tower companies, whether you or someone else C-Band orders by June 30, is that fair? Okay.
Jeff Stoops : .
Walter Piecyk : Also DISH mentioned the substantial minimum lease agreement. Is there a time -- like how does that work? Is it meaning like they agree to X dollars in 2022? How does that work? Or is it just over the life, they're going to pay you X? Which is it?
Jeff Stoops : It is a number of leases. It is not -- it is -- if you could look at it as one because there are certain dollar parameters that we've agreed to per lease, but it is a minimum site.
Walter Piecyk : Got it. So that doesn't give us any sense on timing. It's just like he told you, we'll put up X thousand sites at some point over the next Y years.
Jeff Stoops : Well, we do have some time breaks in there. So there are -- it's a little more defined than that. But -- so over the life of the contract, before all the commitments are ultimately due, but there -- it's not only until the end are they due. There are some due for a long time.
Walter Piecyk : And then just last question. Have you seen -- another one of my favorite topics, have you seen any initial deployments of massive MIMO antennas? I think there was some issue in terms of ramping up production with certain spectrum bands. Maybe that has to wait for C-Band, I don't know.
Jeff Stoops : We've been seeing that for a while with T-Mobile-Sprint on the 2.5G.
Walter Piecyk : Got it. So -- I'm sorry, I guess I should be more specific. I think there might have been issues in terms of the MIMO antennas having ported for C-Band, but I guess it's -- why would that be occurring until the auction is over. So I will reserve that question for a future quarter. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Stoops : Yes.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.
Nicholas Del Deo : So you guys noted that your leverage is going to be above your target post-PG&E, but trend down organically over the course of the year. Does that mean that any share repurchases or then activity are going to be somewhat restrained through year-end? Or would you be willing to stay above your target leverage for longer if the stock is attractively valued and you buy some more or if other M&A opportunities surface?
Jeff Stoops : Well, it means we don't have to rush, but we would like to be at the high end of the target or below by year-end. But that statement gives us quite a bit of flexibility.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We have, just to be clear, Nick, I mean, we have plenty of capacity to continue to do typical levels of M&A and buybacks and still be within our target leverage range at the end of the year.
Jeff Stoops : I think the key answer to your question is, are you going to rush to do it in 1 quarter? Or are you going to wait until the end of the year to preserve maximum flexibility? And the answer is the latter.
Nicholas Del Deo : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then related to the DISH deal, obviously, one of your peers has talked about getting more than their proportionate share of business from DISH by virtue of their deal. Do you feel like you're well positioned to get your fair share of new business? And do you feel like you were well served by waiting some extra time to sign the deal?
Jeff Stoops : Based on the firm commitment that we have, the answer is yes. So I guess the answer to your second question is yes.
Nicholas Del Deo : Okay. That's good to hear. Maybe one more if I could squeeze it in. Has T-Mobile's leasing activity been recovering in the way you had expected it would a quarter or 2 ago? Or has it come in a bit slower?
Jeff Stoops : No. I think T-Mobile is doing just as we thought. They're very busy, very active, very deliberate, very, very -- they're a force. There's -- it's all very busy, and we see a strong year ahead for them.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of David Barden, Bank of America.
David Barden : I guess, first, Jeff, now that you've kind of done this PG&E deal, there's been a gulf between the tower sector and the utility sector for a long time that this deal seems to kind of cross. And I'm wondering if there's a new kind of total addressable market opportunity that you’ve kind of on forward tier as a function of that. The second question, Brendan, would be from -- maybe 2 for you, Brendan, would be, first, on the international churn, is this the number around $10 million a year, that's the new normal that we should expect on a go-forward basis? And then with respect to the PG&E deal, specifically, relative to that 35, is that going to be run rating at 8 to 9 in the first quarter? Or does it kind of graduate up to that 35 over the course of the year?
Jeff Stoops : Yes, why don't you go first, then I'll wrap it up with the more philosophical.
Brendan Cavanagh : Sure. Yes. Well, I'll take the last one first. On the PG&E piece, it does step up a little bit during the year, but it's relatively small, David. I would expect it to not be significant steps up. There are escalators that are built in, and we would expect a modest amount of new lease-up. Obviously, we just brought these sites into our portfolio. So there will be some step up, but it will be generally run rated at the same pace. Of course, the first quarter will obviously be materially lower than the other quarters as we only have it in our portfolio for half the quarter. But on a run rate basis, it will be very small step up throughout the year. On the international churn side, the $10 million is definitely not the new normal. There are some specific things that are driving that number up. I do expect it, though, to be elevated probably next year as well. It's hard for us to say exactly what the number will be because we are in the midst of discussions with the carriers, where there's been some consolidation as well as the other customer where we've had some work with them to try and help them through some issues that they have. So I do expect that there will be additional impact next year, but the exact amount remains to be seen. But eventually, we'll get through those issues, and I would not expect to be at that level long-term.
Jeff Stoops : Yes. In terms of whether this opens up a new source of relationships between tower companies and utilities, David, I mean, I think it remains to be seen. It's not the first. There have been a couple of other transactions between tower companies and utilities. They were not involving any of the publics, however, so this might be the third. And this one was fairly unique in particularly as to its geographic location, but we'll see. We've actually had more than a couple of inquiries. Utilities have very different primary considerations that they have to think about and it has to fit bearings, but we found certainly, in the case of PG&E that it did, and I'm sure that those characteristics could be met again. And because it's never the primary, and frankly, can't be the primary focus of a utility company to make tower leasing top of mind or the number 1 thing they think about, there's always going to be an element of improvement that can be an arbitrage there for the benefit of everyone. So we'll see. We'll see.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.
Colby Synesael : I just actually have 2 points of clarification and then just 1 quick question. First off, point of clarification, Jeff, when you're saying you think you're going to get back to high single-digit domestic growth...
Jeff Stoops : I said mid, but go ahead.
Colby Synesael : I was going to ask if you're speaking about gross or net? And then my next question just real quick. When you said you're expecting T-Mobile churn for 2021, I heard 4 and 5 and I heard 7 and 8. Are you saying you were previously thinking 4 to 5, and now it's 7 to 8? And then my last question, the 299 sites that you've already committed to acquire, can you give us some color on where those sites are?
Jeff Stoops : On the Sprint T-Mobile piece, it was $4 million to $5 million is the number based on what we've already specifically received notices on. The incremental $3 million is an estimate that we've included in our outlook in churn assumptions that we put forth in our bridge, for instance, that's not yet been specifically noted to us, but we are estimating based on what we see in terms of the timing when those leases come due. The 299 lease -- or sorry, sites that are under contract from an M&A standpoint, the vast majority of those are located internationally, but they're spread out. There are some in, I think, the biggest country is South Africa, but there's some throughout Latin America as well. And your first question is on the growth rates. Yes. I think the question was about net. And we're thinking -- we believe that there is an opportunity to see that go back up to mid-levels, above 5, I guess, you could consider more than mid, but we think there's opportunity with all the growth that's out there. The biggest challenge, frankly, on that, Colby, is really about the churn, the Sprint T-Mobile churn. I mean, if you figure that in, that's certainly going to weigh on it. But if you put that aside, there certainly is an opportunity from the growth set that's in front of us.
Brendan Cavanagh : Actually, I thought Rick's question was gross so.
Colby Synesael : So mid-level is a tough 5% net long-term domestic, you think is a reasonable expectation?
Jeff Stoops : Yes. And obviously, higher gross.
Colby Synesael : Yes. And then just actually one real other quick one. You said that PG&E hasn't closed completely. What else is still left to close?
Jeff Stoops : There's a small number of sites. So the total purchase price is about $973 million. We've closed on $954 million of that, so the vast majority of it. There's some number of sites that have certain specific issues that have to be addressed, but we expect them to be cleaned up in the next 6 months, and those sites will just close later.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs.
Brett Feldman : So when we look at the expected leasing from the major wireless carriers, virtually all of the spectrum that they'll be deploying that they haven't used is at frequency ranges that's higher than what they have in their networks today. And so what that would imply is that their existing site grids are insufficient to fully utilize those bands. And so with that as context, that sort of leads to 2 questions. One, as you look out and expect that leasing activity is going to ramp, as some of these spectrum bands get deployed, you've been very amendment heavy for a while with your leasing. I'm wondering if you do expect or maybe even have visibility into that being more balanced between new colocations versus amendments? And then the second is, I'm wondering, do you think that perhaps the nation's power grid is insufficiently dense such that there might be an emerging opportunity to do to a step up here of development of U.S. towers because historically, I think that has actually been your highest return on investment?
Jeff Stoops : Yes. I think amendments will always play a big role, Brett, because they're the most efficient and I think economically beneficial for our customers. And then I think existing structures will get colocation because the existing regulatory regime tapers that. But yes, there'll be some more towers still. There's no question, not only because of the spectrum propagation, but because, I think on a perhaps totally unrelated reason, there's going to be a fair amount of emphasis on closing the digital divide and just bringing broadband to everyone, which is clearly going to require that some more towers get built.
Brett Feldman : Got it. If I could ask a quick follow-up, just around the same concept of densification. We know your opinion around small cells, but I'm wondering if there's any other emerging areas in infrastructure, maybe rooftops, where the economics could potentially become more favorable as these mid-band spectrum ranges are being deployed versus historically?
Jeff Stoops : I think it has to depend on the facts and circumstances. I believe that wherever you can get a true tower, a macro site that always gives our customers the most bang for their buck, but I do believe you will see this spectrum used in conjunction with small cells as well in areas where you just don't get towers. It doesn't mean those areas aren't going to be served, they're going to be served by alternate architecture.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Amir Rozwadowski : This is Amir for Phil. Brendan, can you help us by talking about the pace of activity in 1Q '21? And should we expect slower activity in 1Q than 4Q? And Jeff, can you talk about how much is built into this guidance for the announced this deal? Is that expected to be material this year?
Brendan Cavanagh : Yes, Amir, so our outlook for '21 does assume a pace of activity that is increasing throughout the year, so it's definitely a little bit slower is our assumption here at the beginning of the year, and it picks up in the latter half of the year. That's consistent with our comments we've been making around C-Band and the DISH MLA, all those things will certainly drive more leasing activity in the latter half of the year. But even then, the impact of that to our financial statements will be limited because of the timing of signing up new agreements to when they actually start to recognize revenue. So I don't -- it will step up, I believe, throughout the year, but I think you'll start to see the benefits of that increase next year or late this year.
Jeff Stoops : And in terms specifically of DISH, while we could see some leasing revenue, there's none really contemplated in the guidance and very little contemplated in the services revenue guidance. Although, again, depending on timing, it could be better.
Amir Rozwadowski : And with Brazil, we've heard this business is slow, but this is lower activity than we kind of expected. Can you talk about the pace of activity over the last 6 months? And what you expect it to be going forward?
Jeff Stoops : Yes. Brazil has had a couple of issues that have been impacting it, the overhang of the Oi transaction, which is working itself through, which we think, long-term, will be favorable. For us, it looks like TIM will get most of those -- well, not most, but the predominant amount of those assets with Claro next, and then Telefonica the third or the last lease amount, which bodes well for us from an overlap perspective. And then obviously, they've had their issues with COVID. So as those things settle out, Brazil is actually expected to have quite a material jump in their GDP moving from 2020 to 2021. So as those things kind of play themselves out, yes, we do expect Brazil to get back to its best growing self.
Amir Rozwadowski : And one final one, if I may, with PG&E recently through bankruptcy, what's kind of the protection can you guys have if that happens again?
Jeff Stoops : Yes. We've got pages and pages and legal fees and legal fees that we’re addressing at that point. The structure of the deal, the regulatory posture of where we sit versus where PG&E sits well into this deal, I could spend quite a bit of time with you on that, but I could also just say we're covered.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow : I just wanted to follow-up on the PG&E acquisition. Obviously, the 700 sites you acquired and then the additional 28,000 you have the right to market. Just wondering kind of the tenants per tower in that portfolio? And then on that 28,000, how many do you really think realistically tenants per tower you think you can drive and colocatability of perhaps some of those sites in terms of growing that portfolio from where it's at today, that would be helpful.
Jeff Stoops : Yes. There are not many tenants per tower on the 28,000 today. I don't think they've ever frankly been marketed. The -- on the existing ones, I think I mentioned in my prepared comments that we have approximately 900 tenants, a little more than 900 tenants across those roughly 700 sites. So it's been a totally kind of carriers have had to seek out the appropriate PG&E folks to -- which is the way it works with a type of relationship, which is why we think we could bring additional value. And to be honest with you, I can't hazard a guess on the 28,000, but I can promise you it'll be something.
Eric Luebchow : Okay. That's fair. And then just one more for me. It sounded like you at least had some additional capacity, perhaps later in the year for either share repurchases or additional acquisitions. So kind of where you sit today, the stock, 20% or so down from where you were at last year. I mean, do you think potentially share repurchases versus acquisitions, how would you think about it? It seems like tower cash flow multiples continue to be greater than 30 times in many cases and your stock is trading well under that. So wondering how you kind of balance your thoughts on capital allocation, given those dynamics?
Jeff Stoops : Well, if you -- if we saw those type of dynamics as you described, that would bear in favor of stock repurchases if we saw more opportunities like PG&E, it would.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery.
Simon Flannery : Just wanted to come back to Brazil. I think you'd made a comment about some important spectrum auctions in the international markets. Is -- Brazil has some coming up. What are the other ones that you're focused on? And then coming back to C-Band, given the bidding, there's concerns about the amount of leverage the carriers are taking on, do you think that might change any behavior either in how fast they can deploy C-Band or their kind of outsourcing strategies, et cetera?
Jeff Stoops : Canada has 3.5 gigahertz tentatively scheduled for June. South Africa has an entire suite of 5G spectrum tentatively scheduled for next quarter. Peru has a big one for later this first-half, Chile, Colombia and Brazil. In terms of the money being spent, Simon, I see that and I read that -- I have to assume that our customers know exactly what they're doing, I'm sure that they do. And for that spectrum to have value to them, it has to be deployed. I don't know exactly what the cost will change for them. But ultimately, it's going to have to get put out there. And that's kind of all we can work with. And whether it's 1 quarter, 2 quarters or 3 quarters difference, in the overall scheme of the value creation for us, it really doesn't matter.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.
Batya Levi : In terms of the PG&E deal, can you talk a little bit about the wireless contracts? How they compare to your portfolio, maybe in terms of the tenancy mix, the length of the contract? And if we should assume there could be some T-Mobile Sprint churn in there? And then a follow-up on the churn -- domestic churn this year, is the indication that you're getting from T-Mobile is mostly on the overlapping side, but is there also any coming from sites that are in close proximity?
Brendan Cavanagh: On the tenant mix for PG&E, the vast majority, almost all of the revenue comes from the big 3 wireless carriers. There is some Sprint overlap, which we obviously included any exposure to that in our underwriting assumptions. It's not particularly material, where we have both T-Mobile and Sprint on the same site, and the average remaining term for those tenants is about 7 years. So there's quite an extensive time -- runway left on that.
Batya Levi : Great. And the Sprint T-Mobile churn this year?
Jeff Stoops : All of those sites.
Brendan Cavanagh: On those sites, for this year, we're not really expecting to see any Sprint T-Mobile churn this year. So our numbers that we gave you on our outlook don't include anything for PG&E.
Batya Levi : I'm sorry, for your existing portfolio, the -- about 8 million that you cited, is that mostly coming from overlapping sites, your expectation for it? Or...
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the $4 million to $5 million that we've already been noticed on, almost all of that is on overlapping sites. The remaining $2 million to $3 million is predominantly overlap sites as well.
Batya Levi : Got it. And one more thing maybe on DISH. As we take out some of the equipment for the narrowband IoT network that they had put on your towers, would that show up as churn? Or would that be captured within the new deals that they have with you?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, it depends on what happens with those leases. There is a potential under our deal with them that they would transition those sites to their new architecture, in which case, it would just simply be an amendment, depending on what the change was there based on the original lease. If they're actually going to cancel a lease altogether and not use that site, then it would show up as churn.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins : A couple of questions, if I could, on Slide 8 in the supplemental deck. So there's been a few different questions around how you may allocate capital in 2021. And just curious, I look at this slide, for the last 4 years, the range of capital allocation dollars in total has been about $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. And just curious, given everything that you discussed on the call and the guidance that you outlined, is there a range of dollars for 2021 that we should keep in mind? And then you've also put the period ending leverage on this chart over the last few years, and just curious how you look at the influences of what would get you comfortable to keeping net debt leverage at that higher end of the 7.5 times range you mentioned versus the lower end of 7 times? And just finally, I heard that $10 per share AFFO goal mentioned that you set out to reach 5 years ago. I'm just curious if you have a new 5-year expectation that you're considering or you may share with us just to provide a sort of a compass of what that future direction might look like?
Jeff Stoops : Yes. I'll take the last one first, Mike. The answer is no because of the -- notwithstanding how close we came and how proud we are understanding and projecting the operating components of our business, we -- at least through the AFFO per share line, we found that the movements in interest rates and FX were beyond our prognostication capabilities. So we have declined to do that just as of yet. In terms of the amount of potential CapEx that we could spend, I mean, I don't -- I could tell you we can all get to it fairly easily by looking at the EBITDA contribution that is in our outlook. And then if you bought some things versus bought some stock back, and you ended up with 7.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, that would produce an amount of capital that would fill in your answer. And I don't know if that's how it's going to end up or not. It will depend on whether we choose stock repurchases or acquisitions or whether, in fact, we actually choose to end the year at 7.5 times. We may choose not to do that. And whether we do choose to do that or not, we could continue to depend on whether we see a very -- continue to see a very benign interest rate environment and whether we continue to feel as optimistic as we do today about carrier activity ramping as we move to the end of the year and into 2022.
Michael Rollins : And just in terms of the leverage, what factors get you comfortable at that high end versus low end of the range? And not just maybe in the moment, but over time?
Jeff Stoops : Well, I mean, over time, that would come down. In the moment, it would be because we found things that based on everything I just talked about, we thought it would be very value creative, we took advantage of it this year rather than letting it go by.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Spencer Kurn, New Street Research.
Spencer Kurn : I wanted to follow-up on the trajectory of new leasing activity and organic growth in the U.S. this year. So you exited -- or you ended the fourth quarter with gross organic growth of about 5.7%, and it looks like you're guiding to 5.9% for the year in 2021. And that should sort of steadily -- you expected organic growth to steadily increase throughout the year. Can you just help us understand the cadence sort of when you expect the low point to be? And what we should expect for an exit rate for 2021 to help us understand sort of what growth we could anticipate in 2022?
Brendan Cavanagh : Yes. Spencer, I mean, it certainly will be lower in the first part of the year, the first couple of quarters. We definitely expect to exit the year at a higher rate, not really prepared to say exactly what that is, but at a rate that is starting to ramp back towards where we've been in the past. Obviously, we're kind of at a low, you can tell by looking at our charts, the trajectory of where it's gone to. And we've talked a lot, I think about having a slower year than anticipated last year. That certainly affects what we report, for instance, in the first quarter and second quarter of 2021. But based on our expectations for the increasing activity in the latter part of the year, I would expect that we will exit the year in the fourth quarter at a rate that is higher than the average that's implied by our guidance, and it will build into next year.
Spencer Kurn : Awesome. And just one more. It looks like you've got churn increasing next year largely as a result of Sprint and T-Mobile churn but it still seems like normalized churn, excluding other mergers is still hovering around 1.5%. I've always thought of the long-term opportunity for churn to fall below 1%, do you see a runway to getting there over the next couple of years?
Jeff Stoops : Well, we've been there actually before. If you go back a couple of years ago, we were below 1%. But our historical range is typically between 1% and 2% right now. We're towards the higher end of that. And I would expect that there'll be times in the future where we're higher and times where we're lower, but it tends to fluctuate based on what's happening with specific carriers at specific times.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.
Tim Long : Two, if I could. Number one, maybe just a higher-level question. Given DISH is kind of a new player and the established players looks like they've spent a bunch on the C-Band auction, anything different that we're seeing or that you would expect from pricing or terms of new activity or amendments? And then second, on the CBRS and private side, have you seen any activity there starting to tick up to help as we go through 2021 and into 2022?
Jeff Stoops : Yes. So Tim, on the DISH question, I mean, you say anything different on terms, well, it's actually a very different network. It's kind of the card from the whole full cloth and a clean sheet of paper. So no amendments, it will be brand-new installations of brand-new cell sites, different kind of equipment. So it's very hard to compare. It's just different. So I'm not quite sure what you're looking for in terms of comparing what the DISH terms and particularly rates are compared to, say, an AT&T, a Verizon or a T-Mobile, it's just different. In terms of CBRS, actually, we are. And it's where it's showing up more and more frequently is as a solution to governmental, municipal and school district providers as an elegant and cost-effective solution to bridge some of these digital divide issues that we've all been reading about. And these are some things that we've been participating in and actually are quite a bit excited about. Again, not material this year in terms of financial contribution, but technically and certainly from a community perspective, very exciting.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brandon Nispel : Jeff, I was hoping you could quantify the year-over-year change in the backlog number that you referenced at the start of the call?
Jeff Stoops : Year-over-year, well, that was -- Brendan...?
Brendan Cavanagh : Yes. I mean, Brandon, it's hard for me to put an exact number on it. But our backlogs today are much higher than they were a year ago at this time. I can't give you a specific percentage on that. And obviously, the makeup of the backlog has a lot to do with how that plays out in terms of its financial impact, but they're definitely up. There's a lot more applications received.
Brandon Nispel : Fair enough. Different question. Jeff, maybe could you walk us through your thoughts on potentially reaching an expanded MLA with T-Mobile or even reaching one with Verizon, I guess that goes above and beyond the T-Mobile agreement today. And really, what's keeping your business from being more heavily indexed to Verizon given your exposure there is relatively low?
Jeff Stoops : We're not opposed to any MLA with any customer. It's just that we never have been. It's just a question of a mutual agreement. So we do have -- I'm glad you corrected yourself. We do have an agreement with T-Mobile today. It's not, I think, fully holistic. And at some point, it may get there. And we would certainly be very open to those discussions if T-Mobile went at that, I mean just as we were with DISH and have been historically with Sprint and T-Mobile and others. So that's -- it just takes two to tango, right?
Brandon Nispel : Just from my perspective, it would seem as if that there is a caret in that you guys have 70% of your T-Mobile or Sprint leases going off after the next 3 years, and that's 70% of their synergies. So I guess, do you see a win-win coming in the near-term where you can get more clarity on what the potential churn in booking or backlog activity might look like in the more near term?
Jeff Stoops : There are probably a lot of mutually beneficial outcomes that could happen there, Brandon. I don't think I want to negotiate with you over the earnings call.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Sami Badri with Crédit Suisse.
Sami Badri : Thank you for also squeezing me in. I just want to make sure I get the numbers right on the churn for 2021. And I think you said $8 million of churn from the T-Mobile-Sprint dynamic. And that's from your currently informed view. Does this mean that churn could potentially come in a little bit higher than that if T-Mobile decides to accelerate some of its cost rationalization and synergies?
Jeff Stoops : Yes. It's unlikely, Sami, because our estimates contemplate pretty much -- the only thing that they can do, there may be small differences, but if it's going to be different, it probably would be slightly lower.
Sami Badri : Got it. Got it. And then my other question has to do with M&A. And I know you've targeted very specific developing markets for your M&A mandates. But given recently one of your peers making a push into Europe, does this change where you may potentially be looking to do deals?
Jeff Stoops : No. We actually look everywhere, but we only act where we think it's clear that we can create substantial value relative to the cost and the risk of the investment and we will continue to look broadly and widely and probably act narrowly.
Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops : Ryan, we have time for one more question.
Operator: And that will come from the line of David Guarino with Green Street.
David Guarino : Just on my comment on acquisitions. Can you comment on how competitive bidding is for tower assets in Latin America? And the reason I ask is it feels like the past 2 tower transactions we've seen in developed countries are really sought after, and that's been reflected in the full prices that are paid. So are you seeing a similar dynamic in emerging countries?
Jeff Stoops : I would say it's a little bit less pricy, David, but it's still pricing. We have to be very disciplined and very careful and understand what you're buying. And you have to start with the premise that it's only in the United States that you have the tax shield provided by the REIT architecture, which everywhere else, you're a taxpayer.
David Guarino : Thanks for that.
Jeff Stoops : So Ryan, I think we are done.
Operator: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Rich. Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA’s third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA once again had very strong results in the third quarter, exceeding our expectations in all key financial metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $486.8 million and cash site leasing revenues were $486.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $1 million tailwind to revenues when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the third quarter. They were again however a significant headwind on comparison to the third quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $20.1 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.1% over the third quarter of 2019, including the impact of 1.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6.0%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year, was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.5% on a net basis, including 2.2% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter increased over the first half of 2020 levels, but remains below levels we were seeing in the year ago period. The sequential increase in domestic new bookings was driven primarily by increased activity with T-Mobile. Based on conversations with our customers and continued growth in our domestic application backlog, we anticipate seeing this activity continue to increase in the fourth quarter and into 2012. During the third quarter, amendment activity remained the large majority of our domestic bookings with newly signed-up domestic leasing revenue coming 80% from amendments, and 20% from new leases. The Big 3 carriers represented 83% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7.1%, including 0.4% of churn or 7.5% on a gross basis. Our international leasing activity was up modestly over first half 2020 levels, but still remains impacted by continued COVID-related spending reductions by our customers in a number of our markets. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to international lease up. Gross same tower organic growth in Brazil was 9% on a constant currency basis. During the third quarter, 86% of consolidated cash site leasing fee revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollars denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 10.8% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 8% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass through expenses.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of total debt and $10.5 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.0x at the low end of our target range. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.2x. On July 14, through a trust, we issued $750 million of 1.884% Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 29, 2026, as well as $600 million of 2.328% Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 11, 2028. The aggregate $1.35 billion of Tower Securities have a blended interest rate of 2.081% and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment dates of 6.4 years. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the entire $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2015-1C and 2016-1C Tower Securities, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. As a result of this financing, our next debt maturity is not until April 2022. As of today, we have no outstanding balance under our revolver and the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt is 3.1% with the weighted average maturity of approximately 4.2 years. During the third quarter, we repurchased 580,000 shares of our common stock for $175.6 million or an average price of $302.63 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, we have repurchased 415,000 shares for $124.4 million or an average price per share of $299.54. Today, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan, effective immediately, replacing the previous $1 billion plan, which had a $124 million of repurchase authorization remaining. The company’s shares outstanding, as of September 30, 2020 are 111.4 million compared to 112.6 million at September 30, 2019, a reduction of 1.1%. In addition, during the third quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $52 million or $0.465 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an equivalent fourth quarter dividend of $0.465 per share payable on December 17, 2020 to shareholders of record, as of the close of business, on November 19, 2020. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening everyone. We had another strong financial performance in the third quarter. We produced leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share that were all ahead of both our expectations and consensus expectations. The year has developed almost exactly as we predicted it would on our last earnings call. U.S. customer activity has increased due to T-Mobile activity increasing post merger. International business remained stable to improving, but still challenged due to the continued impact of COVID-19 in those markets, and the capital markets remained very friendly to our company. Because we see further increased U.S. leasing activity in the future over 2020 levels, at a time where international markets recover from today’s COVID-19 challenges, we continue to invest capital in both portfolio growth and by repurchasing our stock which investments, we believe will help fuel future growth in AFFO per share and dividends per share.
Operator: Certainly.  We will begin with the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Phil Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. So, Jeff, you discussed T-Mobile ramping and probably ramps further from the fourth quarter. Do you see signs that other carriers could be slowing down in the next year that would sort of net some of that growth out?
Jeff Stoops: I don’t think materially. I think we will see a period of time, though, in 2021, before we will see the highest levels of activity we expect, particularly with respect to the C-band, because that’s going to take a little bit of time. But I don’t know, I mean, of course, anything can happen, but I don’t see signs today that T-Mobile going one way and the other two are going in the opposite direction.
Phil Cusick: That’s great. And then what momentum do you see in the deployment of MIMO and kind of this is something we’ve been talking about for a couple of years. Does that wait for C-band to be deployed as well or you’re seeing that happen today?
Jeff Stoops: Well, we’re seeing it happen today because we’re seeing 2.5 gigahertz spectrum being deployed today. And, I mean, that is the preferred way, my understanding, that is the preferred way and the most efficient way to get the most out of the mid-band spectrum for 5G.
Phil Cusick: That makes sense. And one more if I can. What do you see in activity levels in Brazil? And how does that compare to what you expected when you bought more sites in December? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Well, we didn’t see COVID, and we didn’t see the – we did not see the level of the FX adjustment, which I think is, in large part, due to. But what we have seen is a steady currency – constant currency adjusted, very good demand, Phil, for those assets, and we think over time and with some improvement in those COVID conditions, we’re going to see tremendous improvement in the numbers coming out of Brazil. But I would certainly be telling you, Phil, if we foresaw everything that has gone on in Brazil this year back in December.
Phil Cusick: I don’t think anybody could say that, but it does sound like there’s still good demand in that market despite COVID.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, there is. I mean, if you were to strip back – I mean, if you look at the demand and the growth rates that Brendan talked about and you see in our numbers on a constant currency basis, we’re very pleased with where things are. And that’s still on a year and in an environment where these customers have pulled back materially in their CapEx in response to COVID. And they basically said that, look, this is temporary, and we’re going to need to spend more money coming out of this thing. So we’re very – we continue to be very happy with our Brazilian operations.
Phil Cusick: Okay.
Operator: And we will now go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. Good evening. You talked about Dish and T-Mobile, you didn’t talk about – much about Cable they were very active in the CBRS. So I wondered, Jeff, do you think Cable can be a contributor in ‘21 and beyond? How are those conversations going? And on T-Mobile, they have a real interest in reducing some of the old  Sprint sites. Is there an opportunity, you think, to work with them to come up with some structure to allow them to take down some of those sites quicker than the current contracts allow?
Jeff Stoops: We don’t really have any of the , Simon. What we have are just straight Sprint leases that are of a more regular Sprint network deployment that have various termination dates over time and we’re always open to discussions. In terms of Cable, we do have Cable, lot of demand for some of our tower space. I don’t know that Cable will ever have a desire to mount a – or the spectrum ability to mount a greenfield nationwide build out the way the other four will have. But we certainly do see some incremental demand and benefit from their spectrum holds.
Simon Flannery: Great. And then just one quick one for Brendan on the leverage, you were at the low end of leverage of 7x. Is that – you’re going to keep that there with the buybacks? How should we think about your desire to stay at that 7x versus coming down lower depending on where the stock price is, if you don’t have other M&A opportunities?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I mean, it’s our desire to stay within that target range. We’re at the low end of it now. It’s – in terms of the share buybacks and the asset acquisitions, it’s really a matter of being opportunistic around what’s available to us at a given time. So we’re there today, largely through share buybacks in the third quarter and we’ve done some already in the fourth quarter. So you should expect we’ll be somewhere around the same range going forward.
Simon Flannery: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now go to the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Great, thank you. Can you remind us how we should think about the pacing of the T-Mobile churn? I think this shared churn is coming in a little less than 2%. Maybe some early color for next year, if there is anything that we should look forward to and on when you would think T-Mo to ramp up?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, we – so we have seen a little bit of churn notifications from T-Mobile, thus far, around 100 leases or so. That is relatively small, probably in the $4 million to $5 million range in terms of its impact for next year. When you look at our overall churn end date, though, in terms of the overlap in particular, we have almost 4 years left on average for the Sprint leases that are on – sorry, for T-Mobile it is, and – but when you look at the specific dates, most of it is out about 5 to 6 years. So we expect that we’re going to start seeing that stuff heavily weighted toward the back end.
Batya Levi: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we will now go to the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Hi, great. Maybe just a follow-up on that, there is a lot of talk obviously about leasing increase in the next few quarters, including in the fourth quarter and then I guess you mentioned up further into 2021. But when you think about the net same-store growth rate ‘21 versus 2020, is there a risk that the churn could step up to such a level that effectively offset the increase in new demand that you’re anticipating to a point where the same-store growth rate in 2021 would actually be below that of 2020 despite this increase in new activity that you’re seeing? And I appreciate you don’t want to give too much on ‘21 just yet, but you might appreciate that that’s a big focus for investors right now. And then secondly, I was just wondering about the capital allocation. You talked about that 5% to 10% portfolio growth over a long period of time. It sounds like there is perhaps less to do internationally, right now, just given the economic situation down there. Should we anticipate that you just continue to step up the buyback in the interim? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: You take the first one I will take the second one.
Brendan Cavanagh: Okay. Yes, Colby, so on the churn question, most – based on the way that it works when we give those same tower growth rates, it’s usually driven mostly by stuff that’s happening this year and into the first part of next year. So a lot of that is unknown. So I don’t expect the churn to be materially higher, although there is some potential for some additional notes. We’re not ready to give ‘21 numbers yet. And I think when we give them, we’ll have a little bit better view on whether there is certain plans from T-Mobile around some of that churn. But the overall growth rates will also be influenced by the activity levels in terms of new leasing activity this year as well, so  until next quarter to get the actual numbers. But what’s happening today and the slowdown we saw in the first part of the year, this year, will have some impact on next year’s same tower growth numbers because it is a trailing indicator.
Jeff Stoops: Yes and how soon we start seeing next year, which frankly, we just don’t know yet today the benefits that will come from Dish really digging in and starting to deploy and the C-band deployments. So, on the – Colby, the 5% to 10% that continues to be the goal, we are not going to hit it this year. If you add this year and last year, we will have averaged greater than 5%, but that’s not going to be how we target things. We just didn’t see the number of opportunities this year that we thought made sense from a pricing perspective. There were enough opportunities out there to hit those numbers. I believe there will continue to be enough opportunities out there. But for us, it’s not only the number, it’s the price and it’s the quality. Unless it all comes together in the right way, we’re not going to buy stuff just to buy stuff and that’s where we are this year. But I don’t think this is indicative that there is not going to be 5% to 10% next year.
Colby Synesael: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will now go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Thanks. So, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One follow-up to begin with, so, you mentioned there is a delay between the booking and the billings and so that lag effect has impact going into ‘21. Can you share with us what that current book to bill duration is and maybe how that compares to the historical kind of range? And then just taking a step back, with the data center purchased this past quarter, curious if you could share your learnings and what you are getting from the data center model and how you see this edge opportunity playing out for SBA over time?
Brendan Cavanagh: On the book to bill, it’s typically 6 to 12 months. It can vary a little bit depending on the mix amendments and the type of activity that’s been done by the carriers, but I would say we’re seeing it stretch out a little bit longer than it has in the past. I think there’s so many major projects going on in particular with T-Mobile that the delayed maintenance are a little bit longer than they happened in the past, but 6 to 12 months is the typical range.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And on the data center, Mike, we’ve now got two, and the purpose is to understand the data center business, data center model, so that we can be in a position when the opportunity is right to know whether we’re going to be operators of many data centers on our cell sites or something less, landlords or maybe something in between. What we’ve learned so far is that it is definitely a different sales business, different customers, but that there are a number of different applications and needs where by having a larger regional data center that is well connected with fiber, lot of interconnect, a lot of meet-me type rooms there, that’s an attractive offering to folks who may want to also have smaller installations at the tower site. We call that the hub-and-spoke theory. At the end of the day, for all of this to make sense, it has to be on our land at the tower site. That’s what this is all about. It’s not separately getting into an unconnected data center business. But for us to understand how to maximize that, we thought that some experience with and kind of experimentation with these two data centers, one in Chicago, one in Jacksonville and Jacksonville, it has also some undersea cable connections, will give us the right experience and skill set. So, more on that as it comes, it’s not going to be material to our financial results any time for the next several years. But it could be a key to really unlocking some value and frankly, land that we’ve already kind of got the sunk cost and sunk investment in. So it’s something that we’re excited about over the long term.
Michael Rollins: And just with respect to that, is there any sense of how many of these hubs that you may need? Like does a hub need to be in the biggest NFL, NBA-type cities or do you think that the hubs need to actually be much closer to the eyeballs in the used cases, and so you might have many hubs and spokes? Like, how do you think about that at least from your initial learnings?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, so far the delta – it’s more of a regional Tier 2, Tier 3 markets for the hubs. So it could be more rather than less, but you got to have the spokes side of things more developed out for this to – for me to be able to sit and tell you that there’s going to be more than two months. That’s why we have the two to prove out now the spokes side of things, and these are both areas where we have a fair number of tower sites to do all kinds of different expected business models, but if there are enough tower sites that connect and makes sense, then you’ve got the creation of another hub opportunity and whether that needs to be owned or partnered, it doesn’t have to be more than the other.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Operator: We will now go to the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Jeff, during your prepared remarks, you mentioned the C-band and you acknowledged that it could take a little bit of time for that to fully benefit the company. One of the questions we’ve been getting is how do we think about the factors that actually determine what that timeline or trajectory is because it seems like there’s two considerations and I’m not sure how to weigh them against you, one of which is just, where your towers are relative to the clearing timeline because there’s going to be a couple of tranches there and which is clear. The other is just which of your  and they are buying a lot of C-bands. So I was hoping really you could just expand for us, as best you can, your thought process around when you think your assets are actually going to be positioned to start to benefit from that reconnected? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, I mean, you kind of answered it for me. You really won’t know until the auctions are done and what got taken by who and where. But one of the benefits of giving the 2020 outlook when we give it is, we hope to have some of that information by then. So we will look at that and bring in whatever we can from the results and be able to factor that into our outlook. I do believe a large part of – at least the early feelings will be based on the dollar spent and the belief that the folks who spend the large dollars and folks have indicated that they are looking to do that. They will be looking to deploy as quickly as they can. So that is kind of how we are going to triangulate things. But it is not going to be – it is hard for me to say with specificity now, without knowing the first thing about who won what and where.
Brett Feldman: Do you have enough towers in the markets that are kind of in charge line such that it actually could be meaningful catalysts for you over the next 12 or 18 months or you would be willing to wait until the majority of that spectrum is clear or you don’t know it yet?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I think the spectrum clearing is going to go faster than folks think, just like it did on the TV spectrum. Some of it’s going to go faster, some of it may not. There is every incentive for the folks who win that spectrum for purchasing, I guess, because they are purchasing it, in some cases, arguably to stay competitive with a rapidly deploying T-Mobile to get things done very quickly. And I think that it’s going to bode well for us and our industry.
Brett Feldman: Thank you.
Operator: We will now go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just following up on Brett’s C-band question, there are presumably smaller share of towers in which the carriers can economically deploy C-bands, especially in rural areas, just given the propagation attributes versus traditional mu band. How would you dimension the share of towers that might not be well positioned to host C-band or do you not think that’s the right way to think about it?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I suspect there will be some, but I think in large part where they have – I mean, anything except the absolute most old towers, which I don’t think – I think you are talking about areas where you really don’t have the same amount – you don’t have the coverage today. These are the areas that the government is actually incentivizing through the RDOF and the – these large amounts of money to bring to these underserved areas. I think for the most part, where most of the carriers are today, where they have existing 3G and 4G coverage, we believe you are going to see 5G brought in the form of a mid-band spectrum.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. And then one on margins which has obviously been very strong, anything that’s going to revert post COVID or do you see kind of COVID-related extra cost about equal to any COVID-related savings?
Brendan Cavanagh: No, we have not really had any type of – I mean our travel and entertainment expenses have been down. But I mean, when you look at the margins in the business, that’s still such a small overall amount that for that to come back, I just don’t see it, Nick. I don’t think you are going to see anything material.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Okay, that’s good to hear. If I can just squeeze in one housekeeping item, are you disclosing the PCS-Leap-Clearwire churn impact this quarter or are you stopping it?
Jeff Stoops: We basically stopped it because it’s become largely immaterial. I believe that less than 0.3% of that same tower churn number, that’s on the domestic side and lower than that on a consolidated basis.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, terrific. Thank you, guys.
Jeff Stoops: Okay.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first one would be for Jeff. Is there any part of you that wonders if the American Tower MLA will affect the kind of cadence and tempo of the T-Mobile spend that you’re anticipating that can come in 2021? And I guess my second question is for Brendan, obviously great deleveraging over the last year. I remember when you guys instituted a dividend that we were talking about as the fixed kind of dividend cost grew there was an inclination to bring leverage down below the historical targets, maybe even closer to 6. Is that now no longer the game plan? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, on the MLA, given what T-Mobile has committed to accomplish under the terms of the approval, I don’t really think so, David. I don’t think there’s anything that is going to impact SBA.
Brendan Cavanagh: David on the...
David Barden: Good to hear.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the leverage plans, I mean, right now, given how low a percentage of our dividend represents, we don’t think that it calls for any material reductions in leverage. I mean, we are naturally just organically delevering returning to a turn and a half every year just for EBITDA growth and the cash that we generate. So that – it keeps it up, requires us to be continuing to significantly invest in the business. So our goal would be to keep it up and continue to see opportunity to invest whether in new assets or share buybacks. But right now we don’t have any intention to lower it materially. But I think over time as the dividend grows, if it becomes a much larger percentage of our free cash flow, then we would naturally see the leverage start to come down.
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
David Barden: Okay.
Jeff Stoops: And keep in mind, we started that conversation when we were more regularly running at 7.5x than at 7x.
David Barden: Great. Okay, great. Appreciate it guys.
Operator: Thank you.  we will next go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Yes. Hey, guys. It sounds like you and your folks are doing well.
Jeff Stoops: All good, Ric. Thanks. How about you?
Ric Prentiss: Yes, doing well hunkered down. Couple of questions, if I could. Can you update us on the status of the FirstNet project in your areas?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. We continue to be active and we still have – we are probably about 50% to 55% of our sites and then with AT&T, I mean, upgraded to FirstNet. So still a ways to go.
Ric Prentiss: And do you expect to get to a 100%?
Jeff Stoops: Coming up quite, but much higher than where we are today.
Ric Prentiss: Yes, Okay. And are you having any discussions with potential C-band winners so they could run faster than the clearing process might suggest?
Jeff Stoops: We have had general conversations, which give basically for us and our customers they know that they can access their gear on our sites, relatively quickly. So – and the parameters are in place to allow them to do that. So we are one of the shortest pole in the tent and not the longest pole in the tent, Ric. So, I mean, there’s just not a lot of need for that. I mean, we’re here and ready to go and they all know that.
Ric Prentiss: Excellent. So last one for you and you might not have gotten this one before. I mean, we are getting questions about the new LEOs and RDOF auctions. Does that affect your customers at all, either new LEOs or fiber deeper?
Jeff Stoops: Well, the – we had a fair amount of leasing that occurred from the last auction that went out to try and bring service to the rural areas. So we are hopeful that the RDOF will have similar impact, but when you mean – what do you mean by impact? I mean, it’s going to be generally, we believe, positive for incremental leasing.
Ric Prentiss: Yes. Do you get the question on wireless operators maybe being impacted by LEOs, from the fiber going deeper into the network?
Jeff Stoops: Well, I think it’s around the edges. It will not be material but they are doing it themselves.
Ric Prentiss: Exactly. No, we just get that roughly a technology question. Thanks, guys. Stay well.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to the line of David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.
David Guarino: Thanks for the question, guys. I was wondering if you can talk about, in general, industry expectations for ‘21 non-FDIC-specific. And the reason I asked is one of your peers provided a guidance range for new leasing activity next year that’s essentially going to be flat versus here, which is somewhat disappointing. I thought that T-Mobile would then be returning. So I just wanted to get your take if that was a company-specific issue or reflective of maybe a broader industry trend for next year.
Jeff Stoops: Well, they actually gave out guidance for next year, which we are not going to do. But, basically T-Mobile is going to be busy, we believe, and the real issue as to what will ultimately drive the financial results, as opposed to the activity levels, but the financial results, will be how early in the year Dish and the C-band work really starts to get going. And that’s about all we’re going to say about 2021.
David Guarino: Okay, fair enough. And then switching gears, maybe on the transaction market, I just wanted to get your thoughts on how that’s evolved since the start of the year. It certainly feels like there is more eyeballs looking at the tower sector relative to a lot of other property types. Have you seen that translated into higher prices for towers that are being paid, and maybe something that exceeds even what you guys are willing to pay for assets?
Jeff Stoops: Well, it clearly has, which is why we will be expanding our portfolio by 5% which would be the first time in many years. There is a degree of interest in communications infrastructure, particularly towers, a lot of new players, and that has pushed pricing up to higher levels, levels such that we have taken a pass on a number of transactions.
David Guarino: Would that be something you guys could quantify possibly in terms of just how much higher multiples are on specific deals and what you are comfortable with?
Jeff Stoops: No.
David Guarino: Nothing specific but...
Jeff Stoops: No. I am not sure that’s productive for our ability to compete and for others’ ability to take notes and compete against us.
David Guarino: Fair enough. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: We will now go to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Thanks. I am getting feedback on this line, hold on. I just have to try and go through it. So you basically indicated that there was a – I can’t do this, you got to re-queue me in because I am getting too much feedback on my lines.
Jeff Stoops: Mark will recap to you, Walt.
Walter Piecyk: Alright, thanks.
Operator: Alright. We will go to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. One for Jeff, one for Brendan, if I could, Jeff, you mentioned in your remarks fourth quarter you are going to be pretty close to your long-term AFFO per share guidance of $10, is there any interesting outlining longer term targets for investors at some point in the near future? And if so, what might that look like? And then, Brendan, you brought up the T-Mobile cancellations, when specifically would those start to go into the run-rate? And then as we think about churn for next year, you had a 2% level and you are not breaking out sort of a one-time churn, so maybe can you help us understand where you are from like a run rate churn perspective annually? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Brandon, we feel pretty good about where things came out on that old $10 by ‘20 with the exception that the FX proved to be much more than the guide that we put out in 2016 anticipated. So we probably won’t be doing that on a multiple year basis based on that experience. But everything else actually was extremely close and in many respects, we beat it quite handily. Yes, we will think about maybe some sub-components of that for maybe longer-term guidance, but to get right down to the AFFO per share, I think there are parts of that particularly FX that might make that not such a great idea. Obviously, it’s not something we can control. Brendan?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Brandon. So on the churn, as it relates to the T-Mobile churn that I mentioned earlier, which is basically Sprint churn, what we have received notifications on, as I mentioned, is about $4 million, $4.5 million, maybe $5 million of impact. And that would be the impact pretty much for next year. Beyond that, we have not received any notifications. If we were to look at that and incorporate what might happen, we are still looking at a relatively small amount for next year, only about 7% of the revenue in total, which includes the amount of time, just mentioned from Sprint is at risk of churn for next year and that’s highly unlikely to be at that full amount. So we don’t expect – we will give you, obviously, more detail when we get to giving guidance next quarter. We will have a lot more information at that point, but that’s the impact of that. As it relates to the churn as a whole, from a run rate standpoint, we were at – from a domestic level, this quarter, we reported same tower churn of 2.2%. I mentioned earlier that about 0.3% or so of that is vestiges of natural leasing to Clearwire. So just under 2%, that’s probably about the range that we will see over the course of the next year. There is a variety of things in there. We have talked about in the past, on a couple of calls, a lot of miscellaneous items including some number on air stuff that some of our customers have cleaned up, some smaller customers that have modified some of their older technology and based on what we have seen already this year, its impact to next year should keep us somewhere in that 1.5% to 2% range on a normal basis and then we will see what happens with Sprint.
Brandon Nispel: Great. Thank you.
Mark DeRussy: Rich, we have time for one more call.
Operator: Thank you. We will go to the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn: Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to just revisit amendment pricing. Historically, I would only thought of higher frequency spectrum having smaller antennas, which would typically command the lower amendment rate, but at the same time, minor antennas, I have heard, are a lot bigger. So I would just want to get your thoughts on how amendment price daily is sort of trending as you see more minor antennas being deployed? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I mean it’s trending higher, but not trending differently than it has historically based on changes in weight and size. So it has been basically logical in terms of the way it has progressed which is good because it’s expected and it’s consistent with at least the way we have conducted ourselves with our customers over time.
Spencer Kurn: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, as we have seen C-RAN being deployed and base stations being pulled into data centers, it doesn’t seem like we have seen a big impact on pricing of towers. But I was just curious of your thoughts on how big of an impact you have actually seen and whether that’s been sort of entirely offset by new antennas filling up on towers as the C-RAN transition has played out?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, we have not really seen much impact at all and I really don’t think we will, because at the end of the day, we are a radio and antenna location business, that is where we got the – we provided the height and the location and the entitlements and whether the computer is there at the bottom of the tower or somewhere else, it doesn’t really matter as much as the ability to host the radio-only antennas.
Spencer Kurn: Great. Thanks again.
Mark DeRussy: So we want to thank everybody for joining us on this call and we look forward to our next call when we report our fourth quarter results. Thank you.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to SBA's Second Quarter. During today's conference call, phone lines are in a listen-only. We will have an opportunity for question-and-answer session later on. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, the Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Nick. Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we'll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2020 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, August 3rd, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA produced another solid performance during the second quarter notwithstanding continued hardship and uncertainty for many across all of our markets due to COVID-19. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $482.4 million and cash site leasing revenues were $482.1 million. Foreign exchange rate were a $1.3 million tailwind to revenues when compared with our internal estimates for the second quarter. They were, however, a significant headwind on comparisons to the second quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $21.4 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5% over the second quarter of 2019, including the impact of 1.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.9%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 6.7% on a gross basis and 4.5% on a net basis, including 2.2% of churn, 0.5% of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter, was again slower than a year ago period and remain similar to the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2019. The measured pace of new bookings in the quarter was primarily due to a slower restart than we anticipated by T-Mobile following the closing of their merger with Sprint, while our other domestic customers were steady. However, as we have begun the third quarter, we have seen a meaningful increase in application activity from T-Mobile that we expect to drive increased domestic organic bookings in the second half of 2020 and into 2021. During the second quarter, amendment activity was again the large majority of our domestic bookings with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming 69% from amendments and 31% from new leases. The big three carriers represented 70% of total incremental provisional domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. We again have a nice contribution to domestic leasing activity from some cap to funded rural broadband providers. As I mentioned a moment ago, our domestic application backlog has started to grow nicely, which portends well for a steadily increasing pace of new bookings during the second half of the year. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7.8%, including 0.5% of churn or 8.3% on a gross basis. We continue to see leasing activity internationally, but was a little slower overall in prior periods due to COVID-related spending reductions by customers in a number of our markets. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to international lease-up. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 10.4% on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, 86.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 10.9% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $394.1 million. Our industry leading domestic tower cash flow margin was 84.3% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 71.5%, also industry leading and was 91.1% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $368.8 million. Our industry leading adjusted EBITDA margin was 72.8% in the quarter, up 300 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 77.1%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. Our second quarter tower cash flow margin and adjusted EBITDA margin were again both record highs for SBA. AFFO in the second quarter was $259.9 million. AFFO per share was $2.29, an increase of 9.6% over the second quarter of 2019 and a 14.8% increase on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 16 communication sites for $13.4 million and building a total of 79 sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased 25 communication sites and one data center for an aggregate price of $61.6 million and we have agreed to purchase 100 additional sites for an aggregate price of $42 million. We anticipate closing on a majority of these sites by the end of the year. The data center is located in Jacksonville, Florida and will allow us to continue to expand our knowledge of the data center business and will, we believe, be ultimately critical to maximizing our edge data center offerings as we continue to develop our strategy and invest in the provision of edge data centers located at our existing communication sites. Jeff will discuss in further detail in a moment. We also continue to invest in the lands under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $12.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 35 years. In our earnings press release this afternoon, we included an update to our outlook for full year 2020 providing increases in all key metrics. Outperformance against our second quarter foreign currency exchange assumptions and slight improvements in forecasted FX rates for the balance of the year have partially contributed to our increased outlook. Increases due to acquisitions and better than anticipated cash basis revenue collections offset by modestly lower expected contributions from new leasing activity represented the rest of the increase in our full-year outlook. As mentioned earlier, we experienced a slower start to new revenue bookings this year than we had previously expected, which ultimately slightly delayed by 90 days to 120 days, the timing of new revenue growth from organic lease-up. However, given our increasing application backlog, our recent customer conversations and the significant network deployment obligations of some of our customers, we expect this timing delay to be just that, a timing delay. We anticipate growth in domestic bookings in each of the next two quarters and into 2021. I'll now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. We ended the second quarter with $10.7 billion of total debt and $10.2 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9 times, which is down one-tenth of a turn since last quarter. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.9 times. On May 26th, we issued an additional $500 million of senior unsecured notes as an add-on to our $1 billion issuance completed in February of this year. These new notes were issued at 99.5% of par value and similar to their original issue, they have a fixed interest rate coupon of 3.875% and a maturity date of February 14th, 2027. The net proceeds of this issuance were used to repay the entire balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. As of today, we have no outstanding balance under our revolver. Subsequent to quarter end, on July 14th, through a trust, we issued $750 million of 1.884% senior tower -- Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 9th, 2026 and $600 million of 2.328% Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 11th, 2028. The aggregate $1.35 billion of tower securities have a blended interest rate of 2.081% and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment date of 6.4 years. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the entire $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2015-1C and the 2016-1C Tower Securities, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. The pro-rated -- I'm sorry, the pro forma weighted interest -- weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt is 3.5%, and our weighted average maturity is approximately four and a half years. During the second quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock and as of today, we have $424.3 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at June 30th, 2020 are 111.9 million compared to 113.1 million at June 30th, 2019, a reduction of 1.1%. In addition, during the second quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $52 million or $0.465 per share. And today, we announce that our Board of Directors declared an equivalent third quarter dividend of $0.465 per share payable on September 22nd, 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 25th, 2020. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening, everyone. The second quarter was another solid one for SBA, both financially and operationally. We again produced leasing revenue, TCF, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO that were well ahead of our expectations. Our TCF and adjusted EBITDA margins were once again a high bar as the highest in our company's history and our AFFO per share grew 14.8% on a constant currency basis over the second quarter of last year. Our business remains healthy and strong. While we greatly appreciate our position in an essential mission-critical business, we recognize that many people are suffering from the continuing impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. When we first reported our first quarter results three months ago, we did not expect so many of the markets in which we operate to still be deep in the fight against the virus at this time. While I'm happy with our performance, our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our team members, customers, suppliers, and other members of the SBA family. At SBA, most of our offices have only been open to essential team members for the last four and a half months and we have figured out how to adjust to being a largely remote workforce. We've had a relatively small percentage of our global team members test positive for the virus and we are thankful that they're all doing okay. I'm extremely proud of the dedication and level of performance by our team members during these very challenging times, serving our customers and our communities. We have learned how to operate safely in this environment and we will continue to do so. In the U.S., the virus has had very little impact on our operational results. Things continue to be good, but as you heard from Brendan earlier, the level of domestic operational activity or new bookings during the quarter was at a similar level to the first quarter, and this is definitely lower than we expected a few months ago, primarily due to a slower start than we had anticipated from T-Mobile after the closing of their merger with Sprint. And we don't really see this as COVID-related, but T-Mobile choosing to initially focus on closing the Boost deal with Dish, integrating workforces, and delivering on synergies. In typical T-Mobile fashion, they seemed to have acted quickly, decisively, and thoughtfully and now have the organization they want in place to turn full attention to their network development needs and obligations. Although our timing was off by a quarter or so on when we initially thought we would see a material increase to domestic leasing activity, the anticipated increases in our application backlogs have now started, providing us confidence and steadily increasing bookings during the second half of 2020. And increased bookings will, of course, drive increased organic revenue growth in the periods following these bookings. We are excited about our prospects because we believe that we have now just begun the necessary phase of increased capital investment in macro networks in order to offer true 5G service. T-Mobile has a lot to do to meet their required 5G coverage goals; including upgrading the majority of their sites with either 2.5 gigahertz or 600 megahertz spectrum and we expect to be a valued partner to them in meeting their build-out objectives. In addition to T-Mobile, our other major domestic customers all have significant projects in process or ahead of them. AT&T recently launched true 5G service on low-band spectrum in a number of markets and we expect both AT&T and Verizon, and many others to be active in the current CBRS auction and particularly, AT&T and Verizon to be active in the C-band auction scheduled for later this year, which we believe will be a key component of future 5G networks and will require new equipment at many of their existing macro sites. In addition, our discussions with Dish have been very constructive and we anticipate that they will be actively engaged in building out a nationwide 5G network over a multi-year period. The fact patterns are setting up very well for a busy domestic leasing and services environment for the next several years. Internationally, we saw solid demand in most of our markets. However, we do believe there will be greater impact in our Latin American and South African markets than in the U.S. from the COVID-19 crisis. Some of our larger international customers have faced challenge economies and even government-required payment deferrals from their customers. As a result, some of our international customers have reduced anticipated capital expenditures and network expansion investment, while they assess the length and severity of the pandemic in each of their markets. We view these current reductions as temporary. Wireless is almost always the primary source of broadband services in these markets. And we believe that as economic conditions improve, wireless capital spending will increase considerably. In our largest international market, Brazil, we're watching closely the recent announcements from our wireless carrier customer, Oi, regarding their plans to divest their mobile wireless assets. A consortium of the other three largest carriers in the market have expressed interest and submitted the most recent bid on these assets, although much needs to occur before any transaction can be consummated. Oi mobile represents 37.6% of our total Brazil cash leasing revenue and 3% of our total overall cash leasing revenue. Oi mobile's largest portfolio-wide carrier overlap is with Telefonica in Brazil with Oi's revenue on those overlap sites representing less than 1% of our total overall cash leasing revenue, although any transaction would likely present much less overlap exposure as the three acquiring carriers would be expected for regulatory reasons to split up Oi's assets based on each carrier's geographic area of greatest need. Our Oi mobile leases also have an average remaining non-cancellable term of eight years. We continue to believe our long-term prospects in Brazil will be bolstered by a shift from four major carriers to just three stronger carriers competing on the basis of network quality. We expect the resolution of Oi's future will be a positive step toward an increased growth cycle in Brazil and improved wireless carrier health. We continue to favor investing in macro towers, including internationally over other types of investments. Over the years, we feel we have proven very adept at managing the risk of international investments versus the benefits of faster growth, higher targeted returns, and more opportunities for investment. At the end of the second quarter, we enjoyed industry leading international tower cash flow margins and our most mature international investments are generating attractive returns well above our cost of capital with much growth still ahead. We are very pleased. In addition to macro towers, we have continued to pursue other opportunities to create value around our sites with a focus on leveraging those assets, strengthening core revenue streams, accessing large new customers, and investing in strategic technology. One of the areas of growth we are pursuing is SBA Edge, where we are focused on using our existing tower assets to offer highly distributed local sites for edge data centers with the potential to provide low latency connectivity to wireless networks. We currently have over 8,000 pre-qualified tower sites in the U.S. as locations where we can situate an edge data center with access to secure space, power and fiber. These tower edge data centers will provide co-location options for customers computing infrastructure with connectivity to a larger metro data center for internet for private network connectivity. In order to support this business, we have deployed an edge data center at our tower site in Foxborough, Massachusetts and we have also made investments in larger more centralized data centers that we believe will act as edge hubs or intermediate aggregation points for compute and storage. Last year, we added a data center, our first in West Chicago, and just recently we acquired our second data center called Jacksonville's Network Access Point, or JaxNAP for short, located in Jacksonville, Florida. JaxNAP is 280,000-square foot 14 megawatt facility providing regional co-location and interconnection services to a variety of customers, including sub-sea cable telecommunications companies and approximately 20 fiber providers, all accessing and sharing the property. JaxNAP will allow us to develop deeper data center capabilities and further enhance our tower edge data center value proposition through increased interconnection and operational knowledge. We're excited about the potential of this value-added business line and are in discussions with a number of interested parties about a range of our expanding capabilities in this area. As we've said many times, however, for this new product offering to ever be material for SBA, a real 5G ecosystem needs to develop. Based on the increasing number of conversations we're having, we are optimistic that this will happen in the years to come. Moving now to our balance sheet, we were able to seize on favorable capital market conditions over the last couple of months to reduce our weighted average cost of debt and extend our maturities. We currently have no debt maturities until 2022 and we have higher liquidity than at any time in our history, including our fully available undrawn $1.25 billion revolver. In July, we issued $1.35 billion of securities in the securitization market, including $750 million of 5.5-year paper at fixed rate of 1.88%, the lowest fixed price debt in our history. Our June 30th leverage was 6.9 times, a level I'm very comfortable with and the strength of our balance sheet provides us with flexibility to continue to be opportunistic around investment opportunities and share repurchases, while still being able to comfortably support our dividend. We did not repurchase any shares of stock in the second quarter; because we were targeting some of the volatility we took advantage of in the first quarter. We didn't get it, but stock repurchases remain a critical part of our value creation strategy. We announced today our dividend for the third quarter at a level of 26% above our third quarter dividend last year. Our dividend, however, remains at a relatively low percentage of AFFO, providing us the opportunity to continue investing in exclusive multi-tenant assets producing returns well above our cost of capital. SBA's adept use of leverage throughout our history has truly differentiated us from our peers to the clear benefit of you, our equity holders. It was another solid quarter in a very challenging time. I want to again thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. We expect to stay very busy, serving our customers and our communities and we look forward to a solid and even better second half of the year. And with that, Nick, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Rick -- I'm sorry, Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Richard Prentiss: Hi. Hey, guys.
Mark DeRussy: Hey, Rick.
Richard Prentiss: Glad to hear you and your employees and families are making it through these difficult times okay. A couple of questions, first, on the updated guidance. Brendan, I think you mentioned some of the increase was in the other category from the waterfall chart. Was that revenue collections or what was that, I think in the U.S. $5 million of the guidance increase was "from other"?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Rick. That's a variety of miscellaneous things. It includes things like some higher cash basis holdover fees that we received some -- a little bit higher on the structural augmentation, amortization and even some back-filling or out-of-period stuff. So, a lot of that was outperformance in the second quarter and a little bit of that is expected outperformance for the balance of the year. Rick?
Richard Prentiss: Hey, can you hear me okay?
Mark DeRussy: Yes.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, now we can.
Richard Prentiss: Sorry about that. Do you still expect to give guidance for 2021 on your fourth quarter call? I know some companies giving on third quarter call. I was wondering what your thought is on 2021.
Jeffrey Stoops: We will continue the same schedule.
Richard Prentiss: Okay. And when we think of the new T-Mobile, glad to hear activity is picking up. As we think about the potential for the Sprint decommissioning concept, do you have a preference as far as getting paid up front, being paid over time, being paid on the current schedule? And how do you think T-Mobile thinks about what their preference would be on how to resolve the Sprint decommissioning into their integration?
Jeffrey Stoops: It's interesting. We've had -- there are two schools of thought among our shareholders. There is the spread it out evenly approach and there is the maximize the NPV approach or the maximize-out-the-returns over time. And I don't want to get too far into how things will go. That will be a one or two or perhaps something of that in the middle. In terms of T-Mobile, I mean they're smart guys. They're looking for the best results that will be a mix of financial certainty, financial results, speed and all the things that they need to do to really play for the big picture, which is the race to be ubiquitous 5G.
Richard Prentiss: Okay. And on the Dish side, you mentioned you guys are having talks obviously looking forward to them getting actively engaged. Any gating factors from your side as far as when to ramp up the efforts with Dish? Do they need the funding in place or just as you think about Dish becoming a more meaningful 5G lease or what are you looking for to occur?
Jeffrey Stoops: We are here and ready to go for Dish. We've worked with them for years now. They're a very good customer and when they say they're ready to go, we are ready to go for them.
Richard Prentiss: Okay, very good. Well, again, I hope you guys stay well in these difficult times. Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks Rick.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Batya Levi with UBS. Your line is now open.
Batya Levi: Great, thank you. A question on the international activity, you lowered the guidance a little bit, but you mentioned that as we exit the year, there is a slowdown in activity, especially in LatAm. Do you think the current slowdown will impact next year's growth? And how -- just generally, how would you think about international growth next year? And just a follow-up on T-Mobile. How can we reconcile the slower start you saw at T-Mobile and commentary from them that they're accelerating the build-out of 2.500 towers? Do you think that's more of a function of maybe activity on rooftops or the replacing our existing 2.5 equipments? And when they're doing that, is there an upside for you? Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I don't think that commentary is inconsistent at all with what we're seeing now in terms of increasing applications and backlogs. So I would say that that's consistent. In terms of international, I think given the types of populations that are being served in South America and South Africa. I think, Batya, you're going to -- it's going to be largely dependent on where the virus is and what stages of lockdown and economic activity you're going to see in those markets.
Batya Levi: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. You talked about some good activity from some of the CAF II builds. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about what opportunity you see from the RF process. It seems like there is plenty of people looking at fixed wireless solutions there? What do you see in that opportunity there? And then any color you could give us on with the T-Mobile applications. What sort of opportunities on amendments putting 2.5 on T-Mo towers or putting the lower-band spectrum on the Sprint towers, if you got a sense of what sort of dollars that's coming out at? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. We do, but we're not going to get into that specifically, Simon. That's -- we don't do that.
Simon Flannery: Is it in line with your expectations?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. Yes, I mean, what people should take from our commentary is everything is pretty much exactly like we thought. It's just 90 days to 120 days behind where we thought it would be. And then in terms of your first question was, yes, we do expect opportunities to come out of that. I mean, fixed wireless, it's got -- in certain areas; it's going to be better for macro sites than others. I mean, some of the applications are more existing poles and not necessarily towers as much as some of the cash stuff was. But we do see opportunities there. We think that there is going to be some added benefit from there. And all of these programs, which this unfortunate COVID-19 thing, so much highlights the need for increased spending and broadband rural connectivity. We will see some incremental benefits from that in the years to come.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.
Michael Rollins: Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could focus a little bit on the edge projects that you were mentioning in the initiatives and a couple of questions there. First, if you could talk about the types of learnings that you're looking to extract from the data centers that you've acquired and how that's helping you frame the edge opportunity? And then the second thing is with the trial that you have in Massachusetts, as well as some of the sites that you've been prepping for the opportunity. How are you thinking about what you can monetize the land for the opportunity for relative to what you get in terms of revenue per tower today? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, that's -- your last question, Mike, is really the business model choice that needs to be made, which is one of -- there is basically three options for us, which is to be just the basic landlord and run out the pad and the -- basically the improvements and the connections. The second will be to take the middle ground and own the shell and the infrastructure, but let somebody else own the active electronics and operate them; and then the third is run the whole thing. And that's really what the data center ownership and operation is designed to allow us to when it really comes time to make that decision to be in a position to do. The other thing that we have learned is that for the folks who will be at -- and this we've learned since over the last year and it was one of the impetuses behind this recent -- our second data center purchase, is that for all the folks who are going to be customers at the edge, at the cell site, they all need and will be coming from some other larger data center repository. So, the -- it's really quite interesting how the connectivity needs to work where large storage goes to moderate size and then ultimately out to the edge, so the ultimate edge. So, the data center connections to the ultimate edge are going to be very important, and that's part of what we're working on here as well. And we want to make sure we understand and have that capability operationally down. And whether in 10 years we own these data centers, more or less, I can't tell you, but we will understand what the relationships are between the absolute edge, which is what ultimately will be our forte and the data center aggregation points along the way that will be necessary to make it all work.
Operator: Our next question then will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Looking at your investments, combination of M&A and buybacks year-to-date, I guess relative to what you typically spend in the year, it seems like you're pretty far off the typical pace. I guess, how do you envision the back half of the year playing out? Do you see enough potential M&A to get you where you want to be? Would you anticipate stepping on the buybacks if that doesn't present itself or are you comfortable letting the leverage continue to come down a bit? And then secondly, as it relates to Oi, and maybe just international more broadly, just curious if you had to take any notable bad debt reserves in the quarter that may have impacted EBITDA? And then secondly, I guess as part of that, are you still getting payment from them right now? Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: Brendan, I'm going to let you handle the Oi stuff. Colby, we'd rather not let leverage continue to come down, especially given the cost at which we're accessing debt and the growth that we have. We'd rather be out investing in our -- in new assets first and portfolio growth second. But we're not going to do stupid expenditures. I mean, that's always been the motto and the course of action here. So, there is a lot of things out there that we continue to look at and will be looking at, certainly enough to meet our minimum 5% portfolio growth. We certainly have the liquidity more than plenty there to accomplish that. And it is our goal and belief that we will get there, but it's got to be the right stuff.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. And Colby, on --
Colby Synesael: So, you think that you would -- I'm sorry, just to clarify, so you think you'll still hit the 5% minimum of portfolio growth, but beyond that in terms of whether it's M&A or buybacks, I guess, regarding the leverage come down--
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, we're going to hard. We're going to work hard to do that. That's certainly our first choice. I don't have it in the bag today.
Colby Synesael: Okay.
Brendan Cavanagh: Colby, on your question with regard to Oi, first of all, in terms of bad debt reserves, we didn't book any material bad debt reserves in the second quarter. And then from a getting paid standpoint, they continue to pay us the full amount that they owe us. So, no issues there.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, your peers have spent a lot of time talking about returns by segment this quarter. And Jeff, you briefly alluded to international return in your prepared remarks. I thought I'd ask you the same. You disclose in ROIC calculation in your supplemental package, what would the domestic versus international split look like? And maybe more importantly, what do you think those numbers would look like when comparing assets that have comparable levels of maturity?
Brendan Cavanagh: Hey, Nick. It's Brendan. So, from a ROIC standpoint, we're not breaking out that information specifically, given the different maturity levels of those portfolios. But I can tell you some general directional information about it, which is -- some of it may be obvious, which is that the domestic ROIC is obviously higher than the consolidated 10.2% number that we put out, while the international was lower. But some of our more mature international markets like in Central America have current ROICs that are in the high-single digits. And in the case of certain countries like Panama actually exceed the U.S. So, the more mature markets that we've been in have been -- performed very, very well. The less mature South American markets typically have ROICs that are in the mid-single digits. We've had obviously some FX headwinds that have weighed on the Brazil numbers a little bit. But on a constant currency basis, that's up north of 9%. So, we expect, as we kind of get into a little bit more normalized time period in terms of currency, that, that number will actually show very well. So it's all gone pretty well in our markets that we've been in for a while.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Okay, that's great. Now, turning to Oi, I think you noted that you have an 8-year average contract term with them.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes.
Nick Del Deo: If I'm not mistaken, that's a blend of some with very long terms and maybe some with more typical terms. Is that correct that it's kind of a barbell distribution? And if so, can you describe kind of what each end looks like?
Brendan Cavanagh: For Oi?
Nick Del Deo: Yes.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So some of -- almost all of the Oi leases are leases that we acquired through leaseback scenarios. They average varying terms, but they're all quite long. So when you look at Oi mobile as a whole, the average remaining term is a little over eight years on those leases. And then we have some Oi fixed wireline leases as well that are actually north of 25 years. So, between the two, it's an extensive long time left.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Got it. Got it. And if I could sort of one last quick one to you, Brendan.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, let me just be clear.
Nick Del Deo: Sure.
Jeffrey Stoops: That eight years was the mobile. We didn't even -- I mean, we didn't even work into that calculation, the wireline.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Okay, got it. Got it. That makes sense. And then lastly, margins were very strong this quarter. Anything we should be aware of that's kind of one-time or one-time-ish in nature, like that were travel expenses or anything like that?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I mean, we were slightly better. I mean, you're looking at $1 million or so in the quarter of probably reduced SG&A due to things like that, but it's not overly material.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tim Long: Thank you. Yes. Just a little bit of color, it sounded like there has been a fair amount of purchase activity in the quarter and subsequent to the quarter. Maybe just kind of a little color on where those tower assets were focused and what was compelling about the purchase. And then just a follow-up, you haven't really mentioned indoor DAS. So just curious of any changes in direction or momentum there. Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: The towers, well, I mean, I'd like to say that was a lot but it really wasn't. Most of that was in the US and they were healthy multiples, because they were very high quality assets. I mean, there still continues to be a strong bid, which goes back to the exchange I had with Colby about that's where we want to be. But that's -- you have to be very careful because prices continue to be challenging and not every tower is created equal. And your -- I'm sorry, your second question, Tim?
Tim Long: Just on indoor DAS.
Jeffrey Stoops: Indoor. Yes, we continue to move along in that area and add a couple properties every quarter, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a steady growing business. And it's a much more difficult business in many respects, because it is absolutely a custom one asset at a time business. But we are very encouraged by what's going on in the CBRS auction, I think it topped $1 billion today and that means there is, from what I understand, wide interest. And I think that's going to be very good for that business.
Tim Long: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, just maybe, Brendan, I think I heard you say that there is a 2.2% domestic churn rate, 50 basis points of that was Leap/Metro stuff. Could you kind of elaborate on what the other churn is being driven by? Is it government or municipalities or M&A? And kind of historically it's been closer to 1%, 1.5% as kind of the core churn rate. If you could kind of elaborate on where you see that going. And then the second piece is on Dish, just as you kind of look out, it sounded optimistic on Dish. The last time, I think third quarter last year; we talked about Dish at some length. It was a lot on the services side. Is that kind of how you see the relationship beginning and then it kind of rolls into the macro side, maybe down the road? Some help there would be helpful too. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: David, on the churn, just as a point of clarification, obviously those percentages are same-tower percentages, so they're representative of a trailing 12-month period. I think you saw a little bit of a step-up in that a couple of quarters ago. And it's really the same thing that's kind of in there that's affecting. So, we're slightly above our historical 1.5%, 1.7% and it's due to a variety of miscellaneous things. It includes a number of smaller customers that are modifying or shutting down kind of older technologies. We have a number of sites that were never on air. So, in some cases, they're not being renewed, plus there is actually still some legacy consolidation churn as well related to old vestiges of old mergers, including Verizon-Alltel, AT&T-Centennial, and all kinds of things that you've probably long forgotten about. So, it's a mishmash of different things.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. And on Dish, Dave, I mean our comments haven't changed. Dish has publicly said that they're doing a lot of planning and prep work this year and very little capex and spending. And we've said the same thing and there is no Dish in our guidance. But we have great relationship. We talk to them all the time. We do a lot of planning and we think we're going to, over the years, be a big help to them and a good partner to them. And it will start first with probably services on the site acquisition side of things, but we think it will certainly morph to and turn into leasing business.
David Barden: Awesome. Thanks guys.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Jon Atkin with RBC. Your line is open.
Jon Atkin: Thanks very much. So, you mentioned a couple of questions back about the T-Mobile pace being 90 days to 120 days slower than you expected. So, I just wanted to maybe be clear. You were expecting second quarter activity that got pushed into 3Q or you were expecting 3Q activity that doesn't see full run rate until 4Q?
Jeffrey Stoops: I was expecting when the merger was completed that they would hit the ground running in terms of applications and activity. And that -- and I was mistaken. What they chose to spend their time on was synergies and integration and getting the Dish deal done and all things, in hindsight, made tremendous sense for T-Mobile and had to be done and that's basically what has happened.
Jon Atkin: Great. Great, that's helpful. And then any kind of thoughts on the other two carriers out there in terms of just the cadence getting stronger or weaker, or the same out of AT&T and Verizon?
Jeffrey Stoops: Really business as usual, Jon.
Jon Atkin: And then lastly, just a quick question, both of your U.S.-listed peers have ATMs in place, and I'm wondering if that's something that you would consider given some of the comments you made about international and you've done data centers and so forth.
Jeffrey Stoops: Not something we've thought of really. So, we're looking for opportunities to buy our stock back.
Jon Atkin: Very clear. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go now to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Hey, Jeff. In terms of like companies hitting the ground running, there is definitely a narrative out there that the C-band is also going on trigger one company to have hit the ground running. When -- should you already be having conversations with carriers? I know C-band is obviously not starting until December, but it's a couple of months away. Are you already having discussions with operators that would give us some indication that people that expect to win at C-band are going to be hitting the ground running in 2021? Because that's certainly the narrative. And I'm just curious when we should expect those dialogues to occur between those carriers and yourself?
Jeffrey Stoops: I would say -- I would answer that question with one word, Walt, indirectly.
Walter Piecyk: Can you hear me now?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I can now.
Walter Piecyk: I didn't get your answer, indirectly, got you. Sorry, my second question was -- I thought there was going to a lengthier answer, I think indirectly was going to be it, I got you. Sorry. Brazil, like if you were going to buy what you own in Brazil today, what do you think a reasonable multiple is for that business? I mean, I know, it's only like 15% of your EBITDA, but with everything that's going on in Brazil right now, currency, what the President is doing there in terms of COVID and everything else, what do you think a good comp is or what you'd be willing to pay for an asset there?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I'm not going to answer that because it will -- I don't know what it will do to the stock. I will answer the question the following. Brazil continues to be a country that has tremendous opportunity. And we're so far ahead of our operational plan there. This is all about FX in Brazil. And everything else is great. And if you look at where the things that you mentioned are and how they have affected FX in Brazil, it's been a one, two, three punch between the President down there and the pandemic. And I guess what people have to, I guess, come to a referendum on is, is this the way it's always going to be in Brazil? Is it always going to just depreciate at these kinds of levels? And if it does, then history will say that we made a mistake. It's that simple. I don't believe that. I don't believe that the economy, the people, the huge demand for wireless services, the fact that they don't have the -- they have to do all the things that made us an investor down there in the first place. And I don't believe the currency is going to continue on a one-way trip to Palookaville. And that is how we think about Brazil.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll take a question from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Brandon Nispel: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Jeff, one for you, you mentioned backlog a couple of times. Can you talk about the type of growth you've seen through July and really where you expect to finish from a year-over-year standpoint later on this year, call it December? Then one for Brendan. In the guidance -- changed the guidance for new leasing domestically by $3 million. Is that de-risk for the remainder of the year from any T-Mobile new bookings that you were expecting to get? And what does that imply in the guides, since a year ago T-Mobile was sort of slowing down, I would imagine you didn't have much T-Mobile in guidance in the first place. But what's in the guide for the year, so, for T-Mobile? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Brandon, it's not -- it's not necessarily specific to T-Mobile. Obviously, most of our guidance is based on stuff that we've already signed up. So there is a portion of that includes T-Mobile, although they've been slow as we've talked about in the last few quarters. So, its contribution to the incremental growth, organic growth is limited. There is still some amount of T-Mobile contribution to our full-year organic growth number that we are including in our guidance based on activity that's happening now and we expect to happen through the balance of the year. But given the delay, it's usually between signing and commencement of revenue. It's relatively small. So, it's -- I guess if they did absolutely zero and they stop today, then there would be conceivably some minor amount of risk. But given the pace at which they're operating, that's just not likely to be the case. So we feel good about our guidance.
Jeffrey Stoops: What was your first question mentioned, Brandon?
Brandon Nispel: Well, you mentioned bookings a couple of times and specifically, I think you mentioned sort of picking up after the second quarter ended. So, I was hoping you could give us an update on where you are from a year-over-year standpoint in bookings or even backlog of unsigned lease applications from a year-over-year basis in July and where you expect to be as you finish the year?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, we clearly expect to be higher at year end than we are today. But remember, our growth rate is a trailing 12-month metric. So -- and it was -- it has weakened since Q3 of last year. So, you need to expect to see that. But in terms of backlogs, we expect the end of Q3 to be better than end of Q2 and the end of Q4 to be better than in Q3.
Brandon Nispel: Would you expect year-over-year third quarter to be better than last year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. Yes, actually.
Brandon Nispel: Good. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Spencer Kern with New Street Research. Your line is open.
Spencer Kurn: Hey, thanks for taking the question. So, just to follow-up on Brandon's comments about the $3 million that you lowered, that you took out of new leasing activity guidance. Could you help us understand the assumptions that underpinned that level of contribution from T-Mobile? Did that assume sort of a reasonable run rate by the end of the year? Or do you think that -- what you had baked into guidance originally you expected to be a midway point to even higher growth in later quarters? And then as a follow-up, could you just help us understand the cadence of organic growth that you're expecting for the rest of the year? Your guidance of 4.1% for the year implies a slowdown in the back half. And so, should we expect the low point to be in the fourth quarter or do you bottom sometime in the third quarter and start to come back up? Thank you for -- thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. So, I'll answer the second one first. We do expect it to -- we expect actually the third quarter and the fourth quarter will probably be very, very similar to each other, but they will be the low point. And obviously, they will be lower than we reported for the second quarter, which is implied in the full-year number. So you should assume somewhere probably the gross number will be closer to 5.5% or high 5% range in each of the next two quarters domestically. And then on the T-Mobile piece, the way that it was guided to previously assumed that they were active in the second quarter in signing up new leases and amendments. And given that it's in the second quarter, we expected obviously a number of those, particularly the amendments to convert to revenue producers before the end of the year, which obviously would have contributed to that growth number. The fact that there has been some delay there pushes that activity toward the latter half of the year and significantly reduces the amount of the impact of this year's financial statement contributions.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, it's not significant. It's basically what happens when you take 90 days to 120 days' worth of activity and push it back, that's the impact on the fiscal year.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I mean, that basically represents the reduction, the $3 million reduction that we put in our numbers.
Jeffrey Stoops: All of this is pushed back, but it has a fiscal year impact.
Spencer Kurn: Got it. Thanks. And just one more question, when you talk about you've seen the 5G amendments today, are those coming in as a typical amendments rate that you've seen historically? Or is there some sort of a difference based on the type of equipment you're seeing going up for 5G?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, they're coming in as expected. And remember that we did have experience with this for a while with Sprint.
Spencer Kurn: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you, speakers. At this time, there are no further questions in queue.
Jeffrey Stoops: Great. Well, we appreciate everyone dialing in today. And on behalf of all of us here, we wish everyone stay safe, stay healthy and look forward to our next call in three months. Good bye.
Operator: Thank you. As stated earlier, today's conference call was recorded and will be available for replay beginning at 8 PM Eastern Time today and running through August 17th. You may access the AT&T replay playback by dialing 866-207-1041 or international callers may use 402-970-0847. Either number will need the access code of 1062990.

We thank you for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to SBA's First quarter results conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.  Some of the information we'll discuss on this call is forward looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2020 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, May 5, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make.  In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. Well, SBA had another solid quarter operationally and financially. And given the unprecedented events occurring around the globe, we feel both pleased and fortunate to be able to report our results.  Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $492.3 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $490 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $2.7 million headwind to revenues when compared with our internal estimates for the first quarter. They were also a headwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2019.  Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5.6% over the first quarter of 2019, including the impact of 2.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 7.8%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 7.6% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis, including 2.1% of churn, 0.7% of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was slower than the year ago period and similar to the fourth quarter of 2019 due to T-Mobile, Sprint and DISH, awaiting resolution of the legal challenges to the Sprint/T-Mobile merger and the ultimate closing of the merger.  Amendment activity was again, the large majority of our domestic bookings with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming 84% from amendments and 16% from new leases. Despite the lack of contribution from T-Mobile and Sprint, the big 4 carriers, now big 3 carriers still represented 79% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. We did have some nice contributions to domestic leasing activity from a couple of regional carriers.  Our domestic application backlog remains strong, and we expect that with the closing of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger now behind us, we will soon begin to see a significant increase in incremental leasing activity. Early activity post-merger has finally begun.  Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 8.1%, including 0.5% of churn or 8.6% on a gross basis. Leasing activity internationally was largely in line with expectations for the quarter. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to international lease-up, and we continue to see contributions from all 4 major carriers there.  Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 10.8% on a constant currency basis. During the first quarter, 84.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.8% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.6% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $398.1 million. Our industry-leading domestic tower cash flow margin was 84.2% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 70.4% and was 90.5%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.  Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $369.9 million. Our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin was 71.9% in the quarter up 150 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 76.7%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. Our first quarter tower cash flow margin and adjusted EBITDA margin were both record highs for SBA. AFFO in the first quarter was $259.9 million. AFFO per share was $2.28, an increase of 10.1% over the first quarter of 2019 and a 13.5% increase on a constant currency basis.  During the first quarter, we continued to invest in expanding our tower portfolio, acquiring 69 communication sites for $79.9 million and building a total of 49 sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or agreed to purchase 137 additional sites at an aggregate price of $52 million, which sites we anticipate closing by the end of the third quarter. We also continue to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $6.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years, the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 35 years.  In our earnings press release this afternoon, we included an update to our outlook for full year 2020. The most material changes to our outlook are the result of significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we initially provided our 2020 outlook. The weakening of the Brazilian real, South African rand and Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, have caused us to revise our estimates for these currency exchange rates for the balance of 2020.  The combination of these estimate changes and the actual first quarter exchange rates relative to our prior assumptions, have negatively impacted our outlook for site leasing revenue by $47 million. Tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were negatively impacted by $32 million, $30 million and $29 million, respectively, due to these updated exchange rate assumptions. AFFO per share was negatively impacted by approximately $0.26. Excluding the impact of these foreign currency-related adjustments, we raised our full year outlook for leasing revenue, tower cash flow and AFFO per share. Even with the T-Mobile-Sprint merger-related overall industry slowdown in the U.S. in the second half of last year and year-to-date this year, we still anticipate another year of solid growth in our leasing business. Although primarily concentrated in the second half of this year. We raised our full year domestic leasing revenue expectations, although we have made a minor reduction to the anticipated contribution from new leasing activity, both domestically and internationally, due primarily to a conservative view around the possible impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.  While these are immaterial changes, and we haven't seen any material delays to date, it is impossible today to say with certainty that there will not be some minor impact from COVID-19 somewhere in our business this year.  Similarly, with regard to our services business, we have lowered our full year revenue outlook largely due to potential impacts from COVID-19 and slower activity levels in the first half of the year, pending the expected lift from T-Mobile post-merger. Our full year outlook still contemplates a pickup in our leasing and services businesses in the second half of the year, particularly now that the Sprint/ T-Mobile merger has closed. Our customers have a ton to do, and it is apparent to us in our backlogs, and in our discussions with them. As a result, we remain excited about not only 2020, but the next several years of activity.  I'll now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the first quarter with $10.7 billion of total debt and $10.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.0x, down 1/10th of a turn since last quarter. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio, of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.9x, which was up 1/10th of a turn since last quarter.  On February 4, we issued $1 billion of new 7-year unsecured senior notes at an interest rate of 3.875%. The proceeds of which were used to redeem all of our outstanding 2002, 4.875% senior notes, pay the associated call premium on those notes and repay a portion of the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of today, the outstanding balance under our revolver is $380 million. The weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.6% and our weighted average maturity is approximately 4 years.  During the first quarter, we repurchased 824,000 shares of our common stock for $200 million or an average price of $242.86 per share. All shares repurchased were retired. As of today, we have $424.3 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding as of March 31, 2020, are $111.6 million compared to $113.2 million at March 31, 2019, a reduction of 1.5%.  In addition, during the first quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $52.2 million or $0.465 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an equivalent second quarter dividend of $0.465 per share, payable on June 18, 2020, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 28, 2020.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. The first quarter was a solid start to the year financially and operationally for SBA. We produced leasing revenue, TCF and AFFO per share that were all well ahead of our expectations. Our domestic and international TCF margins as well as our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter were the highest in our company's history, and our AFFO per share growth on a constant currency basis of 13.5% over the first quarter of last year is evidence of the tremendous growth characteristics of our business, a very resilient predictable business. The solid growth gives us great confidence in continuing to invest in our business while paying out one of the fastest-growing dividends anywhere. We announced today our second quarterly dividend of the year at an annual -- excuse me, at an amount of 26% over our quarterly dividend paid in the second half of last year.  During the quarter, we were active both adding assets to our portfolio and repurchasing our stock. We invested over $100 million in new assets and repurchased $200 million of our stock. We were once again opportunistic in our share repurchase efforts, buying stock at an average price of $242.86.  While all of that certainly sounds great, our thoughts these days are largely consumed by COVID-19. The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been dramatic. We've all been affected in some way, including SBA. Our hearts go out to those that have lost loved ones or had health complications due to this virus. And we have also concern for those who have lost jobs or faced economic hardships due to the far-reaching shutdowns undertaken in response to the virus. Thankfully, we have only had a handful of team members test positive, which we're very fortunate for with the global workforce of almost 1,500 team members. And thankfully, they're all doing okay.  Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, SBA was not a telecommuting company. We learned to become a telecommuting company in 14 countries in less than a week. For those of our team members in essential jobs where they could not work from home, including all of our services team members working for our customers every day, we developed state of the art health and safety protocols with the constant assistance of medical professionals. I don't feel we've missed a beat, and I salute all of our team members for their dedication, service and commitment.  At SBA, we recognize both that we are fortunate to be in an industry that has proven resilient to the challenges of the current environment and that we have an obligation to support the communities in which we live and work. One thing that has become abundant and clear during this crisis is the tremendous importance of broadband and wireless connectivity, a cornerstone to the continued functioning of much of our society during this time of social distancing.  In recognition of this, we have supported our customers and their efforts to address the needs of our communities. Our tower crews have been on the front lines, installing equipment, checking equipment, performing maintenance and repairs, checking and resetting power systems and performing other site level tasks, not normally within SBA scope. We've ensured uninterrupted access to sites for authorized personnel 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.  In many of our international markets, we've made cell on wheel solutions available to our customers at no charge. We've also accelerated payments to certain of our vendors facing hardships. We are busy. All of our team members remain fully employed, and we have recently added some employees in anticipation of a more active second half.  Finally, SBA has committed material financial resources to support charitable organizations in each of the domestic and international markets where we have offices. We believe it is important to support the communities where our team members live, work and raise their families. And we feel fortunate that we are able to do it. From a financial standpoint, our business continues to be strong during these challenging times. The impacts to our core business from COVID-19 have been minor, a few delays here and there. The only material negative impact we currently expect to our financial projections, as you heard from Brendan, is due to weaker foreign exchange rates in our largest international markets. We are hopeful that these rates will improve when the current crisis has eased. But for now, we continue to keep local cash flows in local markets supporting local operations, so there will be no impact to our day-to-day operations in those countries.  The bottom line is the future is very bright for SBA. In fact, as you heard from Brendan, but for foreign exchange adjustments, we would have been increasing our full year outlook in a number of important areas, including AFFO per share. We are financially healthy, well positioned in critical business and there are a number of growth drivers ahead of us.  One of those growth drivers is, of course, the new T-Mobile. With the closing of the T-Mobile/Sprint transaction now behind us, we are on the cusp of significant network investment by all of our U.S. customers. In order to meet their required 5G coverage goals, the new T-Mobile will require meaningful upgrades across their combined portfolio, deploying both 2.5 gigahertz spectrum and 600 megahertz spectrum. Post-merger discussions and early activity are underway.  Verizon and AT&T are each active in upgrades and network expansion for both 4G and 5G as well. In addition, AT&T's FirstNet build out continues in full swing and deployments of AWS 3 and WCS spectrum continue. We anticipate that both the CBRS and C-band spectrum auction scheduled for later this year will be highly competitive, and ultimately, a material driver of incremental growth for the tower industry, particularly the C-band auction. This critical mid-band spectrum is expected to be a key component of future 5G network deployments, and it will require the deployment of new equipment at many of our customers' existing macro sites.  On top of all this, DISH will be active investing heavily to meet their own 5G coverage commitments as they begin the build-out of a brand-new nationwide facilities-based wireless network. These major initiatives will all support continued growth for SBA for at least the next several years.  Internationally, we expect our business to remain steady. While some of our customers outside the U.S. may feel the impact of COVID-19 more than those in the U.S., at least in the short term, due to government-imposed consumer payment deferrals, the reason those deferrals were implemented in the first place is that wireless is and will remain the primary means of communications in these markets. Expanded wireless services capability and reliability required by the market and perhaps regulatory authority, are expected in these markets. Our current levels of activity and backlogs are very good, and absent some material change from this point forward, we anticipate a solid 2020 internationally.  From a balance sheet perspective, we remain very strong as well. We have plenty of liquidity and good access to incremental capital if needed. We remain a preferred issuer in each of the markets where we access capital, and that is even more the case in the current environment. I'm very comfortable with our current leverage level, and the strength of our balance sheet provides us with flexibility to continue to be opportunistic around investment opportunities and share repurchases, while still being able to comfortably support our dividend.  Our dividend remains at a relatively low percentage of AFFO, providing us with great capital allocation opportunities. Our asset focus remains unchanged, whether macro towers, mobile edge, in building or other assets, we seek out exclusive multi-tenant mission-critical assets that will be essential for the needs of our customers today and tomorrow and will provide returns to SBA materially above our cost of capital. We are very focused on and pleased with our return on invested capital. Strength of our financial position shines through in times like these.  Finally, I'd like to again thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. We are all in this together. As I mentioned earlier, I could not be more proud of the way that the SBA team has come together in these challenging times, and performed at a very high level. With their continued contributions, I look forward to a solid and improving rest of the year. We have adjusted well and will continue to adjust well to the times, and we remain laser-focused on serving our customers and providing increasing returns to our shareholders.  Rich, with that, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will start with the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: So it's good to hear that the team is functioning so well in these tough times. I think, Jeff, you guys have had special relationship with DISH in terms of their network build initiatives thus far. They recently announced the first RFP vendor, Mavenir, an OpenRAN company that's going to be kind of the glue that will be kind of pulling their network together.  I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit as you think about your guidance for the year. How dependent it is and how confident you are in DISH's plans for deploying some kind of physical services based network and kind of your conviction that they're for real when it comes to the business? I mean it's super helpful to get your views on that.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, thanks, David. I hope you are well, you and your family. We know DISH is for real. They are extremely committed to this undertaking. There's a tremendous amount at stake and at-risk for Mr. Ergen and his shareholders, if they are not successful and they are certainly pursuing it in every way, shape and form to our visibility to be successful. We're very, very, very involved with them in all kinds of conversations. Recall from their prior disclosures that they expect this year to be a very, very big planning year with deployments really to commence next year.  So based on those comments, we have not included virtually anything in our leasing guidance and perhaps very little in our services guidance, but that does not mean that work relationships are not quite good and quite voluminous between the companies. And I wouldn't bet against him.
David Barden: Jeff, if I could have a quick follow-up, would just be -- you've called out Sprint/ T-Mobile being a big part of the landscape in the coming 6 months, which I think we all expect. I guess some of us were surprised to see that they really jumped out of the gates with the Philadelphia 2.5 gigahertz launch announcing the New York market is going to be next. Is there something about the Sprint/T-Mobile merger deployment schedule that seems faster than expected? Or is it kind of what you were anticipating?
Jeffrey Stoops: We really didn't know. But now we have a lot greater visibility. And I think what we're seeing is that based on where both companies were, particularly with Sprint with their already somewhat deployed 2.5 G that will be the markets that T-Mobile will quickly gravitate to launch first because it's logical, and it just makes sense. So I don't know that there's any surprises there as much, David, as there is now starting to be some clarity.
Operator: We'll next go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Richard Prentiss: Glad to hear you, your families and employees are doing well, hope that continues. First, also a shout out for a very well-timed opportunistic stock buyback, again, always good to see. You mentioned that the services business would be down $20 million view to view on your guidance because of impact from COVID-19 and maybe a slower first half activity with the Sprint/T-Mobile merger. Is that -- and again, it might not happen, you haven't seen anything so far, I think you said but is that really thinking about what zoning permitting and the ability to get folks onto the site might be?
Jeffrey Stoops: I think what we're experiencing so far, and again, none of it is COVID -- well, it is COVID-related, but none of it's material. Everything just seems to take a little bit longer. And when we talk about basically doubling the size of the industry's work with the T-Mobile stuff getting really cranked up, just hard for us to just think that there's not going to be some COVID-19 slowdowns. I can't name them all today, but it's just -- there has to be, right? So -- and the rest of the services thing was -- I mean if you look at our first quarter numbers, and it's going to be the same in the first -- in the second quarter, it's was somewhat behind where we thought it was going to be.
Richard Prentiss: Okay. And as you think about the guidance for the year, the increasing operational activity. Do you need an MLA in place to capture some of that services and leasing growth? And how long would new MLAs take, given how complicated some of this work might be?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, we have MLAs in place with both T-Mobile and Sprint, which continue to be in place. Now I don't know that they're entirely perfect or totally all covering the things that now need to be covered, but they do cover quite a bit. So the answer is no. We don't need any of that to do the things that we've reflected in our outlook.
Richard Prentiss: And how long would it take to update MLAs? Is that a matter of months, quarters?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, it could be done a lot quicker than that. Yes, I would certainly think it would be months and not quarters.
Operator: We'll next go to the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.
Spencer Kurn: I'm glad the organization is all seems to be pretty well and healthy. Just a question on organic growth. Your full year guidance is below where you are -- where you reported in the U.S. today. But it sounds like you're expecting a pretty big uplift later in the year. So could you just help us understand the cadence as we move throughout the year? Do you expect the second quarter to be the trough and gradually improving from there? And I don't know if you want to give us some more granularity, but if you could help us understand the exit rate that you're expecting moving into 2021, that would be very helpful.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I'm going to give some high-level comments, and I'm going to let Brendan give you some more detail. I mean, recall, Spencer, the way we report that metric, it's a trailing 12 and when Sprint/T-Mobile DISH pulled back, it was like August, September. So you had -- from September on, you had very reduced activity. You had it again in -- you had nothing basically from those guys in Q1. And you won't have really anything from them in Q2. So there's 3 quarters right there that do the kind of -- run the mental mathematical gyrations, and you'll see where things should trough out and then where they should begin to pick up again. So Brendan, do you want to hazard a guess as to exit rates? I'm not sure we want to do that.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. No, I don't think so. I mean, I think you've already suggested spencer that you've calculated based on the revenue bridge and our supplemental package, what the full year number is. And if you're looking at it domestically, that number is lower than what we reported for the first quarter. And that's because you will see a lot of the impact that Jeff was just talking about that's happening in the first quarter and into the second quarter, it will continue to drive a trailing 12 months number down, even though we expect activity levels from a leasing standpoint to pick up in the second half of the year, the financial impact of that will not be felt until we get to next year. So I think you should assume that the exit rate is somewhere around what we have projected there for the full year, maybe slightly below that, actually, but accelerating from that point forward would be our expectation.
Spencer Kurn: And then just on that same topic, you still got about 70 basis points of churn from MetroPCS, LEAP and Clearwire. When should we expect that to roll off? Does that happen later in the year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. You should expect that it will continue to decline, because that's, again, a trailing 12-month number as well. So it will continue to step down because there's not that much left. We've probably got about $4 million or so of annualized revenue from them that we expect to churn off over the next few quarters, I'd say. So it's stepping down already. So that percentage will be lower by the end of the year.
Operator: We'll next go to the line of Simon Flannery.
Simon Flannery: Good to hear everybody is doing okay. You mentioned the CBRS and C-band auctions. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity for macro towers with CBRS? Are you talking to some carriers that may deploy that in a macro environment? Or is it -- do you think it's mostly small cells? And then you also commented on some decent activity by regional carriers. Is that something that you're seeing being sustained? Or is that more of a kind of a short-term boost there?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, when we didn't really have anything from T-Mobile and Sprint, it mathematically made up a better percentage of the quarterly pie, Simon, than it typically would. Now I do think there will be some continued activity from those carriers, but I do think it will also decline just because of the law of larger numbers as you see more of the T-Mobile activity come in through the year.  CBRS, I think, is primarily going to be mostly at in-building phenomena, but we are having some conversations with not only traditional wireless providers, but also cable companies about macro installations. But as between the 2 auctions, CBRS versus C-band, I think it's without question going to be a more exciting and more activity producing auction for us with respect to the C band.
Operator: We'll now go the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.
Philip Cusick: I wanted to ask how much visibility you really have into that services revenue, around the implication is that you're confident that Sprint/T-Mobile is going to be asking you to do a lot of work for them. Can you dig more into what that work will entail? And is that typical of your relationship with Sprint or T-Mobile in the past?
Jeffrey Stoops: It's typical of both, and it does imply that we do the work on our own towers when it comes to amendments or co-locations.
Philip Cusick: Is that sort of a standard thing that would happen? Or is this a contract that's already been signed already?
Jeffrey Stoops: It's kind of historical relationships and some contracted relationships as well.
Philip Cusick: Understood. And would you frame your thinking on the price of amendments that T-Mobile may be needing versus the average level as they do the work?
Jeffrey Stoops: No. That would not be a good thing for me to do, Phil.
Operator: We'll now go to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed.
Walter Piecyk: I guess you called new leasing activity, the 7.6% growth number, Jeff, that actually, based on how we -- I guess we do our math, seems like it didn't drop that much relative to kind of the lack of activity we've been talking about for the last 6 to 9 months. Are you still expecting only, I think, what was the last guidance, $49 million of new lease activity in 2020? Because it seems like -- I mean I think there's some differences in how we do our math versus you, but it seems like your rate would be higher than that for the year. Even if it drops a little bit in the June quarter, if it builds in the September, December quarter based on TMO activity, that you can do better than that, the 49 that I think you talked about in February.
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, we actually reduced that number slightly to 47, Walt, in the...
Walter Piecyk: Sorry, I didn't see Joe's notation here. You're right. He has one [indiscernible] of -- yes, so even more so than, like how is it going to be 47 when you started the year at a 7.6% growth rate based on that 3.37% number last year, that's like a 14, 15 a quarter.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. But we -- if you look at that, obviously, it implies that, that number goes down. And again, that's trailing 12 months. So if you calculate it out for the balance of the year, we're expecting that 7.6% to be lower in future quarters. And it is lower than it was -- that is a step down. In the fourth quarter, that gross number was 8.2%, and I think the quarter before that was 8.6%. So it's stepping down basically based on what we've seen since mid third quarter last year, which was kind of a stop by T-Mobile, in particular.
Walter Piecyk: So aside from law of large numbers and everything else, though, let's say, it steps down next quarter, whatever, $10 million. But by the September and December quarter, you should be executing on the activity that T-Mobile is delivering to you today, right? So again, I think it's -- it feels like it's hard to get to only 47 for the year.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, recall that's a financial -- recall that's a financial number, not an operational number. So operationally, we expect to be extremely busy but those are -- go ahead, Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, where Jeff is going, they don't commence until later. You said in the third and fourth quarter. But we're just now starting to have activity pick back up with them. We've not been signing anything with T-Mobile basically year-to-date, including going back a quarter and a half of last year. So all the things that start to happen now, even if we become very busy from this point forward and you layer on a commencement date to that, that's typically several months after it's signed up. It's very limiting in its impact for this year. But we do it--.
Walter Piecyk: That's very helpful because it's interesting because T-Mobile talks about trying to get that 2.5 on their towers in time for the 5G launch of the iPhone. So if they're just kind of giving the stuff to you now and the activity is not going to hit until 2021, there seems to be maybe a bit of a disconnect there. In terms of what they're communicating, right?
Brendan Cavanagh: I mean, listen, it could be. They could be more aggressive and faster than what it's historically been, but we're not projecting that because we don't have that -- any evidence of that at this point in terms of a timing.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. Well, it is starting. It could go quick. Sprint did have -- I won't say a fair amount, but they do have some 2.5G out there already. I don't know if it's enough. It's certainly not enough to cover a nationwide iPhone launch. But I mean it -- I think the main thing to keep in mind, Walt, is the numbers that you read are financial -- they come off the financials. But when we talk about pickups and activity, that's the stuff, that's the signing and the dirt being turned and things like that. And the financial results trail all that stuff.
Walter Piecyk: So if you book $1 million of new lease activity in Q1 of 2021, what does that mean in terms of when that site has been turned on for a user for the operator?
Brendan Cavanagh: We sign a $1 million...
Walter Piecyk: No, no, no what I'm saying is revenue hit your new lease activity. That means that you ramped on that probably means they turn it on right. Do they turn on that quarter? Or do they turned it on the prior quarter?
Brendan Cavanagh: It usually commences paying once they've installed and turned it on usually when they usually sync up. It doesn't always work that way. It could be that they are paying earlier because there's a drop-dead date. But typically, those 2 things align.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.
Nick Del Deo: First, I think you target 5% to 10% annual portfolio growth. How do you feel about achieving that target given the number of towers you've acquired to date, have under contract and what you see in the market?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, we got a lot to do. We exceeded -- got close to 10% at the end of last year. So we've kind of started off with some lower levels of activity. And you could see where those numbers are now. There's plenty of stuff out there, Nick, and that continues to be our goal. I don't think we will repeat last year's percentage levels, which I believe were close to 10%. But we're still shooting for at least the 5%, and there's enough out there to be done. But like we always do, we want the right assets.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Okay. That's good to hear. And then land purchases were down quite a bit versus the normal pace. Is that just a function of legal work getting gummed up because of lockdown?
Jeffrey Stoops: That is one, probably more visible aspect of COVID-19 than perhaps -- that new builds, I mean, a lot of the land purchase things require notorization. Well, you can't leave your house, you can't get things notarized. So that's a very tangible area of the business that has seen some delays. And just to add in. Internationally, most of those deals require an in-person negotiation with the landowners, and that obviously is being limited as well. So it definitely is having an impact.
Brendan Cavanagh: Now we also think that there will be some more willing sellers.
Nick Del Deo: That was actually my follow-up question, yes.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. Yes. Yes. So we think there will be some balance there over the course of the year.
Operator: We'll now go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins: Just two questions, if I could. The first, is spectrum borrowing continues and turns into commercial rentals can you unpack if SBA has monetization opportunities associated with that? And then secondly, any new thoughts on how to try to manage the foreign currency volatility that you've been ingesting in the financials?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. Our leases are spectrum specific, Mike. But given why that spectrum is going to be provided in times of a national emergency and to be used to help us all get through this. Provided that's what it's being used for, and it goes back at some point. I don't know that we're going to charge for that. Now if it requires additional equipment to be utilized in new radios and new antennas. But if it's just to help people get through, and there's no new equipment required, even though we could charge for it, we're probably not going to charge for that.  In terms of foreign currency, we have spent many sleepless nights looking for P&L hedges, but they are -- they are cost prohibitive. The only real hedges that work are when you are purchasing an asset in advance, you can hedge your dollars going in. And then the other hedges to borrow in local currency. But in terms of what I think you're talking about looking for to purchase a P&L hedge, there is not one out there that is -- makes cost sense.
Brendan Cavanagh: We do try to -- at this time, there's limited repatriation of money, and we are -- where we see opportunities trying to invest the cash flows that are being generated in these markets back into those markets. So with that, it's not really costing us at this point. It certainly is costing us in terms of what we report. But as Jeff said, it's somewhat cost prohibitive for what is basically fixing a paper loss right now.
Michael Rollins: And has that performance over the last few years in FX changed the way you approach international acquisitions in terms of hurdle rates or the types of assumptions that you're layering into the models?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. We continue to adopt increasingly higher foreign exchange hurdles as part of our modeling components.
Operator: We'll now go to the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.
Colby Synesael: I'm glad everybody is doing well. First off, on the guidance, you mentioned that excluding the FX headwind, you actually would have increased your guidance, but you did mention that you had taken down your expectations for new leasing activity. I was just curious if you could explain where that would have been. And then secondly, on churn, I think going into 2020, the expectation in the United States was that churn would be elevated because of non big 3 elevated churn? Just curious if that number or assumption has changed.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Colby, on the guidance changes, so net of the FX, there is an increase to several of our metrics that we guide to, including leasing revenue. And the organic lease-up we did reduce slightly. The increases as a result of some of the other things, particularly in the first quarter, we had a strong out-performance in a variety of things, including certain onetime fees, and out-of-period billings, those sorts of things that were higher than expected. So that allowed us to increase the guidance for the full year, net of it.
Colby Synesael: And those things that will offset in the second quarter that we should be thinking about when we model? Or are they things that will recur again?
Brendan Cavanagh: No. I mean we always have some of that stuff every quarter. And so one of the challenges is certainly for us to pinpoint exactly what it's going to be because it's not the typical recurring monthly payments that we get under the leases, which is the majority of our revenue. But there will be some amount of it, whether our assumptions in the first quarter were a little bit low, and it continues a little bit higher or that's the new normal, I don't know yet. But I think if you're modeling it out and you keep it in the same ballpark as what we saw in the first quarter, you'd be okay.  And then on the churn side, there wasn't really a material shift in the non-big 3 churn from what we talked about last quarter. In fact, our reported numbers, I think, quarter-over-quarter were very similar. They were flat.
Colby Synesael: So churn of roughly around, I think, 2%. Is that the number? I can't recall right now.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. For the U.S., 2020 would be somewhere around 2%.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Sami Badri with Crédit Suisse.
Sami Badri: Jeff, you've mentioned on prior earnings calls regarding M&A activity and potentially entertaining other deals in other regions. Now there have been several references on this conference call regarding slowdowns in decision-making and just the overall pace just slowing down. Would you say that your plans for any M&A or deal considerations have also slowed down for 2020, pushing them back a little bit or even potentially pushing them out to 2021?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I don't want to -- I don't want to over -- your comment, I think, overemphasizes the I hope I didn't convey that there's been too much of a slowdown because there really hasn't been so far. There's been little delays here and there. But there would be, I think, some potential -- much more larger difficulties in trying to execute an M&A deal in a new market in a geography where we've never been before. I mean some of these states are on lockdown and not allowing travelers to go into these countries. So when that -- I mean obviously, those things have to change before you would be able to even embark upon anything like that.  So I think there are just some practical limitations, which I don't think should surprise anybody who's been watching what's going on. That are going to be a little different this year until this situation all has a little bit more clarity, which will make the typical year of M&A a little more challenging for everybody than naught.
Operator: At this time, we've exhausted all questions in the queue. You may continue.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I want to thank everyone for dialing in from probably their homes. And I do want to convey that our thoughts and our efforts are with the safety, not only here of our team members and our customers, but all of you out there on the call be safe, be well, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 8:00 p.m. Eastern this evening, through May 19 at midnight.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-20 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.  And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And now let me introduce, Vice President of Finance Mark DeRussy. Go ahead sir.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Julio. Good evening everyone and thank you for joining us for SBA's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.  Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2020 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detailed material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 20th and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our results. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another solid quarter in the fourth quarter with strong operating and financial results in both our Leasing and Services businesses. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $481.1 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $478.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were in line with our estimates for the fourth quarter, but were a headwind on year ago comparisons. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 6% over the fourth quarter of 2018, including the impact of 2.3% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 8.3%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 8.2% on a gross basis and 5.6% on a net basis, including 2.6% of churn, 0.8% of which continues to be related to Metro Leap and Clearwire terminations. The balance of domestic churn is from a variety of sources including a number of smaller customers that are modifying or shutting down older technologies, some sites that were never on air that are not being renewed and some legacy consolidation churn.  Domestic operational leasing activity representing new revenue placed under contract during the quarter was down from the first half of the year and sequentially from the third quarter due to the industry-wide slowdown as our customers awaited resolution of the legal challenges to the Sprint, T-Mobile merger.
Mark DeRussy : Thanks, Brendan. We ended the fourth quarter with $10.4 billion of total debt and $10.3 billion of net debt. Our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.1 times. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.8 times. On November 19, we repriced our $2.4 billion from a coupon of LIBOR plus 200 basis points to a new coupon of LIBOR plus 175 basis points.  Subsequently, on December 3rd, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps on $1.95 billion of that term loan effectively replacing both of our existing interest rate swaps. The effect of these two – these new swaps was to reduce our swap interest rate by approximately 30 basis points to a fixed rate of 3.78% through the maturity date of the existing term loan.  After year-end, on February 4th, we issued $1 billion of new seven year, unsecured senior notes at an interest rate of 3.875%. Our lowest cost unsecured senior note issuance ever. Net proceeds of this offering were used to redeem all of our outstanding 2022 4.875% senior notes through the associated call premium on those notes and repay a portion of the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.  As of today, the outstanding balance under our revolver is $175 million. Pro forma for the senior note issuance, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.6% and a weighted average maturity is approximately 4 years. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Brendan and good evening, everyone. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a very good year for SBA. We delivered solid financial results in both our Leasing and Services segments, finishing at the high-end of guidance for tower cash flow, AFFO and AFFO per share and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range for leasing revenue, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA.  Our full year financial results also finished above the high-end of our initial 2019 guidance given in February of last year for leasing revenue, services revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. We produced over $2 billion in revenue for the first time in our history and we grew full year AFFO per share by 11.7% over 2018 and by 13.1% on a constant currency basis.  We also grew our portfolio at the high-end of our 5% to 10% goal and we expanded into an attractive and exciting new market, South Africa. We completed several debt transactions improving our cost of financing with each one. We bought back over 2 million shares of our stock at an average price of $231.87 and we began paying a quarterly dividend ahead of schedule.  All of this was accomplished notwithstanding the domestic industry-wide slowdown for our customers during the second half of the year resulting from the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the T-Mobile, Sprint transaction. As I said, 2019 was a very good year for SBA.  Looking ahead now to 2020 and beyond, we are very excited about the prospects for SBA. We anticipate the resolution of the legal challenges to the T-Mobile, Sprint transaction will set us up for significant network investment by our U.S. customers involved in the transaction including DISH beginning in the second half of the year. 
Operator:  We have Cusick for the first question. Go ahead. 
Philip Cusick: Hi, it’s Phil Cusick from JP Morgan. It sounds like as we model 2020, we should think about the first half activity slower to the fourth quarter activity. And then ramping in the back half. Can you give us any update on the Sprint, T-Mobile or DISH cadence of potential network planning? And when those two start to really impact numbers? Thanks. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Lot of discussions, Phil, but no real operational activity yet. Of course, given the fact that there is no closing and while I believe that things will begin to move pretty quickly, particularly on the T-Mobile side, DISH had their own commentary yesterday as to the cadence of what they will be doing.  But on the T-Mobile side, I think they will go quickly once the deal closes. But I think we are going to have to wait and see as to when that happens. They need to get through the California PSC and I think some other things. I think there is a lot of folks ready to go, but they are just waiting for the starting on. 
Philip Cusick: Okay. And then, a separate topic, can you give us any early read on the South Africa business, sort of how you think about that now that is under your belt and attractiveness of other markets as you look out over the next year? Thanks. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, we like South Africa a lot, I mean, within our four years of investment there, we took close to a 1,000 towers and they’d be actually 1,000 today I am not quite sure to tell, but it’s getting off close to over two tenants per tower with a very good return on investment.  A dynamic market, lot of room for additional Greenfield builds. All the things we look for. So we are very excited about the ability to continue to grow in that market. We will continue to look for markets like that. We think there are some out there.  They are not tens or twenties of those kinds of markets. But there are some out there. We are going to continue to pursue them and if you don’t mind, I am not going to name them. 
Philip Cusick: Okay. And then, if I can just follow-up and be even more explicit since we are almost two months into the quarter, it looks like we should be assuming that activity in 1Q is probably even below 4Q. Is that a good starting point?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I don’t know if you should assume it this below. But I think, you should take the comments about things came to a pretty abrupt slowdown, at least with respect to several customers in August. And the reason things changed to that slowdown have not changed as of today. 
Philip Cusick: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. 
Operator: Next question is from Spencer Kurn from New Street Research. Go ahead.
Spencer Kurn : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Could you just remind us of your average remaining lease term with Sprint? And how are you thinking about approaching the decommissioning of Sprint’s network? Do you see value in signing in increments that would minimize churn? Or would you take a similar approach as you did with IDEN and coordinate a steady decommissioning schedule? Thanks. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, Spencer, on the overlap, the average remaining terms for the Sprint leases on sites really overlap the T-Mobile is about 4.5 years. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I am confident given the complexities of what will need to be accomplished by the new T-Mobile, Spencer, that we will have an opportunity to address those issues and again we have no kind of religious opposition to MLAs and if it makes sense, for both parties, as we have in the past, we would do one. 
Spencer Kurn : Great. Thanks. And one other question, could you just talk about the amendment pricing that you tend to see for mid-band spectrum like 2.5 or potentially CBRS and C-Band and how that relates to what you’ve been seeing for low-band spectrum over the last couple of years? Thank you. 
Jeffrey Stoops: We don’t want to get too specific. The incidence of CBRS amendments haven’t been that numerous yet and there is really only of course been one customer that has deployed mid-band and the massive MIMO architecture.  And I would say the amendment pricing has been reasonable fair and consistent with all the other types of amendments that we’ve done over the years in terms of dice and weight and all the things that have kind of gone into the way we’ve conducted our business. 
Spencer Kurn : Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Next question is from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Go ahead. 
Colby Synesael: Hey, thank you. We had an expectation that churn domestically in the U.S. have come down or improved in 2020 versus 2019. It doesn’t looks like that’s happening. I waswonderingif you can give some color around that.  And then secondly, as it relates to the GTS acquisition, I appreciate you gave, I think some 15 times tower cash flow, but I was wondering if you could be just more explicit and tell us what the expectation is for revenue and EBITDA in 2020. Thank you. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Colby, first on the churn, it is down slightly because, in terms of same tower analysis due to the falling off of the IDEN churn that took place in the fourth quarter of last year, but as we look out to next year, some of that’s a reduction due to the loss of IDEN is being offset by a little bit of a slight elevation in Q4 churn notices that come from a variety of miscellaneous items.  I mentioned some of those items in the scripted comments, if there is a number of smaller customers that are modifying or shutting down older technologies for one. An example of that is we had a one regional carrier who had previously entered into some leases with us for 4G installations that we had reported in the past is leased out.  But those were separate and apart from their pre-existing leases for their 3G installations which they are now decommissioning. And so, we’ve had a few slogs of things that were a little more than what we typically see and because it’s happening in the fourth quarter, that carries over into the 2020 numbers. 
Colby Synesael: GTS.
Brendan Cavanagh: Oh, GTS. Yes, so, on GTS, the numbers around tower cash flow contribution or EBITDA contribution is approximately $30 million for next year, a little over $30 million, $31 million. Now that can be affected of course by where the FX rate shakes out. But that was our expectation when we put the guidance together and from a revenue standpoint, it’s approximately a little more than 40, 42-ish. 
Colby Synesael: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Next question from Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. 
Simon Flannery: The guidance. How are you thinking about AT&T and Verizon? We obviously heard Verizon last week talking a lot about diversification. But the FirstNet project is moving along. So is that fairly level year-to-year? Or any big changes you might call out? And then, you touched on CBRS there a minute ago.  We got the auction coming up. How are the carriers you are talking to thinking of deploying that is still very much in small cell indoor type environment? Or do you think there might be potential to use it more broadly on macro cells?
Jeffrey Stoops: First question, Simon, is our guidance assumes essentially the same or certainly materially the same contributions from AT&T and Verizon. And in terms of the CBRS, primarily because of this hour and which of course affects the range, the CBRS will be more of a small cell indoor.  But there will be some macro uses as well and we are actually – we have some applications for outdoor uses. So, it will be across the board. But we’ve don’t think for at least for SBA, the CBRS spectrum will be nearly as impactful as the C-Band spectrum will be. 
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Next question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Go ahead. 
Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Good afternoon guys. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Hey, Ric.
Ric Prentiss : Hey. Couple questions. One, how should we think about the process flow as far as when applications start coming with the T-Mobile, Sprint merger with amendment activities that applications could turn into revenues. Is it a three month, six month process or possibly longer? 
Jeffrey Stoops: It depends on what they want to do. Amendments can go quicker, have a history of going quicker, certainly much quicker than brand-new leases. So, yes, I would use 3 to 6 as opposed to 6 plus on a colo.
Ric Prentiss : Makes sense. And like you said, you are not opposed to MLAs, particularly given the complexity of this thing. Is there the possibility of doing involving DISH in it as well? DISH on their call talked about how they are interested potentially in some of the Sprint decommission sites. So, what’s the process for them to take over those leases or weave it into an MLA?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, we got to know what leases you are talking about first. And we are not anywhere close to that and then you have to match up heights and terms and things like that. The – my personal opinion is, while there will be a lot of business from DISH and the spring up of space and the inventory of what is available will be great for both DISH and the tower industry.  The exact matching of existing Sprint or T-Mobile leases that are to be decommissioned, that’s going to be a tougher match. 
Ric Prentiss : Sure. Makes sense. And then, I think, we’ve heard from AT&T that their Firstnet project was maybe 75% done, but I am not – I am sure that’s probably not equal across the whole country. As you think about how much you’ve seen touches from AT&T. Can you give us an indicator of where you think they are in the project based on your sites?
Jeffrey Stoops: I think their 75% includes a lot of advance work, I think, from our perspective, we think it’s closer to 50%. 
Ric Prentiss : As far as touching your sites?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, in terms of work yet to be done. 
Ric Prentiss : Sure. Okay. And last one for me, you mentioned CBRS could be some indoor systems or small cell systems, what’s your appetite given your balance sheet and your ability to put money to work on a shared infrastructure to get involved and maybe neutral host indoor systems and how big could that opportunity be? And what’s the timeline?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, our appetite for the right deal is quite large. The – finding the right opportunities are more difficult. They are asset-by-asset type of opportunities. And we are pursuing that area. We’ve actually added some resources there, because we do think there will be some good opportunities. But it’s an asset-by-asset hunt. 
Ric Prentiss : Sure. And timeframe as far, is it kind of more like a 2021 event? Or it starts becoming noticeable then for the industry?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I mean, there is things going on now and now there are folks that are building out DAS systems and I think it will be converted to CBRS and folks that are interested in types of technologies today that will be converted to CBRS. So, it’s evolving our – just like we have always approached the tower business. We are very much focused on looking for the best assets. 
Ric Prentiss : Okay. And then, congrats on a nice return on your stock buyback. That was very attractive, obviously. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, thank you. 
Operator: Next question is from Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Go ahead. 
Brandon Nispel : Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. You guys are obviously excited about through the second half of 2020 relative to the second half of 2019. Can you maybe just help quantify thoughts what you would expect to see from a increase in the backlog perspective from a year-over-year basis? Secondly, Jeff you talked a lot about massive MIMO antennas. Have you been able to sort of determine in your conversations with customers how deep into the network those type of antennas will need to go? And then, maybe further to be able to quantify for us what that would mean in terms of an amendment? Thanks. 
Jeffrey Stoops: I think they are going to go fairly deep to achieve true 5G outside of the dense urban markets. All of the work that I have seen indicates that that’s what you need in the macro world. And you really do need the mid-band spectrum to do it, which I think explains a lot of the different carrier spending patterns.  I don’t want to get too much in. I think I commented enough on the amendment pricing earlier about how that gets priced. So if you look back at Spencer’s question, you’ll have your answer there. And in terms of the backlogs, yes, it all depends on when these deals get done.  I mean, these – the backlogs I think will grow very, very quickly. It could grow – it could double or more in fairly short order. I do believe lot of work has already been done in terms of what needs to be done to the network. Really a question when is the deal going to be approved and I do think I said six months ago, I think you’ll see a lot of activity. 
Brandon Nispel : And I guess, just a follow-up, the only thing that you need to operationally to prepare for that and any limiting factors such as tower climbers that could make it so the growth doesn’t come in as fast as you expect? Thanks. 
Jeffrey Stoops: We tend to retain given our size of our company and our benefit plans. We are pretty good employer. And we will tend to use our tower climbers to make sure that the work will get done on our towers to make sure that the amendments and the colos are our towers get done. So we can prioritize there.  So it will be okay. There will be some general shortages in the industry, but I don’t think it will be catastrophic. I mean, it will be an issue, but we always get through it as an industry. 
Brandon Nispel : Thank you. 
Operator: Next question is from Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Go ahead. 
Nick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I assume it's a very small number, but can you share the number of domestic towers you own that effectively can't accommodate another tenant? And sort of related to that, is there any reason a player like DISH wouldn’t be satisfied with the height of the RAD centers you tend to have available?
Jeffrey Stoops: Second question answer is no. First, I am sure, we have some, but 20, 30, 40, very, very small. 
Nick Del Deo: Okay. So it’s any material number. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. I mean, the towers – there are towers that require augmentations, but virtually every site we have can be augmented to accommodate additional. So it would be de minimis. 
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Got it. And then, when you are negotiating with a upstart network like DISH, are you inclined to try to get some sort of guarantee for the parent company on the lease or are you satisfied with the wireless operating entity is being the sole signatory?
Jeffrey Stoops: That’s probably more information that we’d like to talk about on the call. 
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. 
Operator: Next question is from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. 
Brett Feldman : Thank you. I guess, it came out during the trial that DISH has signed master service agreements that cover over 30,000 sites I am not entirely sure what those are, but I am curious whether you are a party to any of them and if they’ve made any commitments to you? And then, second, you’ve not done a significant amount of domestic tower M&A recently and there is a range of reasons you’ve stated for that in the past. But one of them was, there was a big mismatch between the valuations of private tower assets in the U.S. and where your stock was trading.  Your stock has obviously performed a lot better. I am wondering if that’s changed the math such that there might be more opportunities to make domestic accretive acquisitions or if asset quality is really the gating factor as opposed to just the price. Thanks
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, Brett, my belief on the first question is that, when DISH was building out their IoT network, they did sign up a number of master agreements including one with us. And in the course of that, a number of companies, including us submitted all of their portfolios. So that DISH was able to analyze those and figure out which of those towers would be suitable for that project and now they are able to do the same for the broadband network.  So that is what that statement was all about. So that was under kind of the different – that was under the narrow band project. But the work that the – the work that they did about how many towers that they’ve analyzed that would be suitable for their uses that was true.  So your second question, in terms of the M&A, some of the stuff that we announced is actually more of what we have in the pipeline is in the U.S. actually. And there are – there is still – there is a lot of price competition. Still there is some varying quality of folks who have done some things that to their terms and conditions that we don’t really like. But there are still some good assets out there that we will pursue. And clearly, as we look at where we traded things like that, we would take that into consideration. But we are very interested as we always have been adding quality assets to the portfolio. 
Brett Feldman : Are you finding that valuation, the valuation gap has started to close or private multiples just expanding in conjunction with the public space?
Jeffrey Stoops : Well, we took about a four-turn jump in, after the T-Mobile, Sprint deal got announced by – I can't say, I'd see private multiples jump four-turns in two weeks. But I – who knows, who knows? So, let's just say hopefully the gap has closed a little bit.
Brett Feldman : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.
Jeffrey Stoops : You bet.
Operator: Next question is from David Barden from Bank of America. Go ahead.
David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the dividend hike, obviously, the percentage is fairly eye popping, Jeff, as you pointed out. Your dollars aren't necessarily all that large. 
Jeffrey Stoops : Right. 
David Barden : But I was wondering if you could kind of layout where you think the – what kind of message you want to send? Is this what SBA can do with a dividend growth stock for some extended period of time? Is this more of a just a signaling about your conviction in the next cycle would be helpful on that?  And then, the second question kind of related is, just given how strong the stock price move has been that we've seen in the last six to nine months, at what point do you start thinking about a split to try to make it easier for more money to kind of find its way into this, given that it's you have an income growth leap story? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops : Your kind of perception – your former way you kind of talked about the dividend is correct, David. When you – when we kind of thought about this, it's more to give a longer, higher growth trajectory, because as we model things out, the first dividend we would had to pay when we got to the exhaustion of the NOLs, frankly would be higher than the dividend we are paying now.  So, you have to start out high and then, of course, grow it not by the same pace. So by doing this, we can grow it at a faster rate, which some people are going to like. We can control our remaining NOLs and frankly, we can payout less of our AFFO. So we think it's a win, win, win, win, which is why we chose to begin to pay it early. And even though we start small, we can grow it faster.  And then, on the split, I am ashamed to say I really hadn't thought of that. Do you think that's something we should do?
David Barden : I think people would love it.
Jeffrey Stoops : All right. Well, we'll give it some thoughts. All you analysts weighing in. Send Mark. We could send Mark. Here you go. We'll take a short poll, we’d ask everybody in next question. 
David Barden : There he goes. We will take a sell side poll.
Operator: And the next question is from Batya Levi with UBS. Go ahead.
Batya Levi : I am for it too. And in terms of the – maybe given the faster growth outlook that you are expecting as we exit the year, can you also remind us where you would like to be in terms of your leverage target? I think as you started to grow the dividend, you potentially thought that you might come inside the second level, but any updated thoughts there? And then, a second question on, how you think you are positioned in terms of the rules which Sprint, T-Mo is expected to build over the next few years? And how you think about the leasing amendment mix change as we exit the year into next year?
Jeffrey Stoops : So, if you looked at our guidance, Batya, if we don't spend some money on something, whether it's stock repurchases or portfolio growth, we are going to be in the mid-6s in leverage. So, - and that's not where we want to be.  So we would want to be high-6s to low-7s. So that's the – that's kind of the new area I think where we are targeting. And again, if we see something great to buy, we'd be very pleased to go above that for temporary period of time. I mean, the cash flow generation power of the business is pretty amazing. So, on your second question, I think we are going to be very well positioned with T-Mobile. They are a very good customer of ours. We have a close relationship. We have a lot of work to do with them. And I think, we will be very a active partner in terms of both amendments and colocations, just as we were in the first half of last year prior to the August central shutdown.
Batya Levi : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And speakers, no more questions so far.
Jeffrey Stoops : Great. Well, we really appreciate everyone joining us on kind of our year-end wrap up. And we look forward to sharing our 2020 results with you as we go. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Earnings Results Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later you will have an opportunity to ask questions.  And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Chief Financial Officer, Brendan Cavanagh, please go ahead.
Brendan Cavanagh: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today is Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mark DeRussy Vice President of Finance, is a little under the weather today and thus will not be on this afternoon's call. However Mark will be available subsequent to the call to address any follow-up questions you may have.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Brendan and good evening, everyone. The third quarter was another very good one for SBA. We delivered strong financial results in both our Leasing and Services segments and as a result, continue to deliver very healthy growth in AFFO per share. We allocated capital into new assets, share repurchases and our first cash dividend. We took advantage of the low interest rate environment with a successful new financing and we continue to work closely with our customers on their network investment plans. In the US, we are continuing to see the majority of spending around 4G densification. All 4 major US wireless carriers were active during the quarter, with the bulk of investment coming from amendments.
Operator: Thank you.  And we do have a question from the line of Spencer Kurn from New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm trying to get a little bit better understanding of the level of activity you're seeing. You previously talked about an expectation for a slowdown in network services following your agreement with Sprint, but you didn't really seem to have that. So was it the case that you did see a slowdown from Sprint and T-Mobile as you've called out but the Act was replaced by others or did that full -- or just never actually occur?
Jeff Stoops: Well, I think we have suggested that there has been a slowdown by any and all of, Sprint, T-Mobile and Dish, as a result of the uncertainty that is pending, because of in-decisions around the -- and uncertainty around the merger.
Spencer Kurn: Okay, got it. I was just a little bit confused that it didn't really seem to manifest in the Services business.
Brendan Cavanagh: The third quarter results during the first half of the quarter continued to be at a similar pace to what we've seen in the first half of the year. It was only towards the end of the quarter, we started to see some of the slowdown Jeff just referred to.
Spencer Kurn: Got it. Thanks. And then if you could just help us on the organic growth guide for the US. To get to your guide of $63 million for the year are you assuming essentially a similar quarter in Q4 that you saw in Q3?
Jeff Stoops: We would expect the incremental year-over-year growth to probably be slightly less than it was in Q3, but in terms of activity levels and contributions not that different.
Spencer Kurn: Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: We have a question from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Thank you. I was just trying to plan for next year. Can you help us understand how you think about the base case for Sprint, T-Mobile, if you would expect that new leasing activity to ramp from the current levels if the deal closes? And any churn that we should think about next year? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I don't think we're going to get into next year's guidance because we'll be giving that next quarter. And I do think with the pending lawsuit from the State's Attorney Generals that I believe is scheduled to start in December, we fully expect by the time we will be given our report in late February, that there will be clarity and resolution that will allow us to speak to that issue with the degree of certainty, Batya. But I can tell you that today both Sprint and T-Mobile are pretty much neck and neck in terms of sites where they're both tenants, Sprint is 6.4% of cash leasing revenue and T-Mobile is 6.5% and the Sprint leases have a remaining term of 4.6 years and T mobile leases have a remaining term of 4.3 years.
Batya Levi: All right. And maybe just one follow-up. T-Mobile just increased guidance saying that they're ramping 600 coverage sooner than they had anticipated. Are you seeing any pickup in their activity as we exit the quarter into the year-end?
Jeff Stoops: Our comments were as to the combined magnitude of Sprint, T-Mobile and Dish and I don't really want to call out variances as amongst any one or the other.
Operator: We have a question from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Landon Park: Thank you. This is Landon Park on for Simon. I'm just wondering if you can shed any light on, if you're seeing anything out of the cable companies or how maybe your discussions are progressing on that front? And if there's anything you can talk about on the M&A front either domestically or internationally? How do you see some of that shaping up as we head into next year?
Jeff Stoops: That's two separate questions, right?
Landon Park: Yes, two separate questions.
Jeff Stoops: Well, there is a number of discussions around CBRS. So I do think there are some active interest there. Tests and uses of existing available CBRS and which may or may not lead to further interest in what ultimately gets auctioned. And as far -- so that's a positive sign as to potential additional activity for our sector. In terms of M&A activity, there is always something out there and there are a number of opportunities that we're currently looking at, which we're always looking at. So we continue to believe that we will once again have a goal for next year of at least 5% portfolio growth and we are optimistic that we'll hit it once again.
Landon Park: Thank you. And just one follow-up, on your earlier comments related to the leasing activity and how that trended in the quarter, were you able to pull any specific numbers around sequential decrease or maybe what the year-over-year looks like?
Jeff Stoops: I think we gave you the year-over-year for the quarter.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean we can't really get into the specifics in terms of individual dollars. The quarter was in terms of operational leasing activity, meaning new business signed up, and I'm talking just domestically here, was a little bit lower in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter, but it's not something that we would get into parsing the specifics on.
Landon Park: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next we have a question from the line of Jonathan Atkins from RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkins: Thanks very much. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the topic of mobile edge compute and you talked about the New Continuum acquisition that you made in West Chicago. And going forward, do you anticipate that your macro towers are going to be kind of the core of your participation in that segment? Or do you think that buying smaller sites, data centers, not necessarily tied directly to mobile infrastructure might be an activity that you would get more into following on your initial investment in the New Continuum?
Brendan Cavanagh: No, John. At this point, we're thinking about it as the former that the focus would be on maximizing the opportunities presented by the existing investment we have around our macro sites in the related real estate and that the New Continuum investment gives us really a research and development opportunity to understand the variety of business models that may come to pass at the cell site.
Jonathan Atkins: Okay. So it sounds like nothing of that nature in the near-term, in addition to what you've already done? And then in Africa -- in South Africa or Africa more broadly just any kind of further thoughts on the opportunity set for further M&A?
Jeff Stoops: We will look. But as we've discussed South Africa opportunity the rest of Africa is very different. We have the operational expertise and capabilities to handle it, should we find a opportunity that we like from a price and future opportunities perspective, but nothing imminent.
Jonathan Atkins: Thanks you much.
Operator: Next we have a question from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First there have been some M&A rumblings regarding Oi both from established players in the market and potentially new entrants. Can you update us on your remaining lease terms at Oi and if Oi were to merger with an existing carrier or be carved up somehow, how should we think about the puts and takes for your business?
Jeff Stoops: Well, for a big picture perspective, Nick. As we've discussed many, many times it wouldn't be necessarily bad if four players went to three in Brazil, because we think that the overall health of the Brazilian wireless telecommunications sector would be improved by that. Depending on how things would get carved up, if they are amongst existing players there would be some consolidation, decommissioning issues which will to be tower specific and participants specific and we'd have to look at that and see how that played out. Obviously, if there were new players coming in from outside of Brazil that would definitely be a positive thing. So it's all very fact specific, but even if there were a short-term intra-country event where there was four going to three, we think over the long haul that's ultimately very positive for the health of the Brazilian wireless sector and we think long-term we would be a great beneficiary of that.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah Nick on the average lease terms. I'll have to get back to you after the call with the exact number, but it's pretty extensive because most of the leases we have with them and as part of sale leasebacks are on varying schedules. But we had very long-term commitments from them that were double-digit years. So let me get the exact number based on how much time has gone by and we'll get that to you offline.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Sure. And then on. Jeff, I think you made 14,000 managed properties, where you had the rights to install in building systems and you said that it grow material -- materially. I guess first, can you say what that number was a year or two ago, so we get a sense for how aggressive you been in terms of snapping up these rights. And second, can you tell us how many generate revenue today? Or if we think out a few years, what a reasonable percentage might be for the share that might generate revenue?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, it was probably half that a year ago, maybe 10% of those generate revenue and I wouldn't say we have unfettered rights to do whatever we want with those properties. I mean that's part of why there isn't more a higher percentage of participation, revenue participation on them and why we're more excited about CBRS, because really what we found in the -- in building area over time is, unless it's like a premier venue like a casino or a stadium, you get to venues where there is just a real economic issue as to who pays and where is the value proposition. And we believe CBRS is going to be a so much better economics solution than DAS that it's going to open up just so many more venues. So that really gets to the heart of the optimism around that.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Sounds great. Thanks, guys.
Operator:  We do have a question from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Hi, thanks. Curious, as you look at the antenna structures that are on your domestic towers, are you able to tell based upon your inspections and the work that's done ahead of time from your carrier customers in terms of what they're putting on your structures, where the tenants are technologically in terms of, are they MIMO, advanced MIMO type of antennas and from all of that information are you able to deduce the percentage of these antennas that might be upgraded over a 1, 3 or 5-year period, based on their age capability, new technology as it's become available? I'm just kind of curious how you look at that cycle of antenna updates and upgrades from your carrier customers? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: We are able to do that, Mike. And if you're driving at where are you in terms of 5G and if you believe that outside of the dense urban markets you need the massive MIMO type antennas, which will be primarily necessary in mid-band spectrum to effectively offer 5G service, which we are of that general belief. The only carrier that has done any of that today to a -- I won't say small degree, but certainly not to a large degree is Sprint, with the 2.5G spectrum, so if you're trying to gauge the remaining opportunity set there it's very large.
Michael Rollins: And are you starting to see some of those applications for amended structures come into the pipeline? Or is it too early for that?
Jeff Stoops: For a while, we were seeing a fair amount of that from Sprint, and I think we will continue to see that from Sprint and we will see an even greater -- much greater dramatically greater amount of that once there is clarity around the deal and others are going to follow.
Michael Rollins: And one other question. Based on your experience with Federated and CBRS,8 do you expect that spectrum to be deployed for outdoor applications and appear on your macro towers? Or do you think that's going to end up being more of a indoor spectrum there?
Jeff Stoops: Right now it looks like it's going to be more indoor because there are power limitations on its use, but there are petitions afoot that would change the power regulations around that spectrum that could make it a more viable outdoor use.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Operator: Next we have a question from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Jeff Stoops: Good afternoon, Ric.
Ric Prentiss: Hope Mark is feeling better. Question on the Services business in the guidance. I think you mentioned the total of T-Mobile, Sprint, Dish you've seen a little slowdown in the Services business. I know you're not giving 2020 guidance yet obviously, but should we assume that could have a pacing issue as we look into leasing activity into the first half of 2020, then if you've seen kind of a slowdown in the Services business going into fourth quarter? Maybe you don't get a decision until maybe sometime in February of '20? Just trying to think pacing.
Jeff Stoops: Well, I mean you -- Dish has kind of gotten a free pass, right? So they don't have to do anything, nor if you were Charlie Ergen, why would you do anything until you have clarity, since you don't know whether you're deploying a narrow band or a broadband network. So I think when you kind of think through the logic of where the vast difference in the roads that some of these folks are on yes or no, merger up or down, I think that answers your question, Ric.
Ric Prentiss: That's good. Thanks, Jeff. And then as we think through the -- what if the answer is a, no, on the merger and was a, yes, we could see an explosion of applications coming in that could help the pacing? But what if it's a, no, what do you think might happen or how we're going to ?
Jeff Stoops: You're going to see a ton of stuff happen because one road is really good, the other road is really good for activity. The problem is the two don't really overlap.
Ric Prentiss: Yes. Just need a decision, so they know which way they are going?
Jeff Stoops: Dish is the best example. You can't spend money on narrow band and have it work on broadband and vice-versa.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. To Michael's question on CBRS and does sound like it seems more indoor now for CBRS and once those petitions come through, what would the role you play in an indoor CBRS type situation look like? Would it be providing capital, providing neutral host systems, but what would the role of SBAC and how are the economics compare to say macro towers versus small cells?
Jeff Stoops: We will be a capital provider, a network owner, we would basically take the burden off of the -- we would basically be appealing to the building owners to upgrade and offer them a solution that they would find attractive at a price point that made sense for everybody. And then it will be a recurring revenue model for us.
Ric Prentiss: And again, trying for probably significant co-location to tell the owner of the building, we'll get everybody, so you don't everybody pestering you individually?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, that's one. Although there are also models where they just pay one fee, and if they want to -- if that's the way they want to provide their people whether it'd be a residential complex or commercial complex, Internet, for example, for a private LTE system, there might not need to be any co-location for it to be an attractive proposition.
Ric Prentiss: Last one for me is none of us are FX experts, I know, but in the past you'd hazard a guess on with the elections or other things happening in Brazil or the economy in Brazil. How do you look at the Brazilian FX rate, where you think it might be headed as you look at that being a fairly sizable amount of your revenues, at least from a book leasing standpoint?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, Ric, we look at what the, I'll say, "experts" say. I mean, all the various banks and financial institutions and economists that study that sort of thing. Unfortunately, nobody has been quite right over the last few years, but expectations are that there will be some modest improvement from where we are today. We've actually seen some improvement, just over the last week or so. But I think the more that pension reform is now kind of getting addressed and some of the other big question marks that are sort of overhangs in Brazil get settled, it will provide some stability that will hopefully go through to the exchange rates as well. I mean, from our perspective, we have what we have down there. We try to address it by being wise in terms of the timing of when we repatriate money, to the extent that we can, put expenses that we have a choice between US dollar-based and BRL-based, we try to offset our revenues with expenses in local currency. Although, we found financing options down there to now be particularly attractive in terms of pricing. So at this stage, it's a little bit limited in terms of our options to mitigate it. But, no, we watch it closely and we try to manage the timing on the repatriation of funds and one funds go down.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And Brendan, in his comments raises a good point. We haven't put any fresh US dollars into Brazil probably including two years now. So everything that is really being considered is the timing of money that's coming at -- Brazil is a source of cash, not a use of cash. So what you're seeing and what's frustrating from a reporting perspective is just that. It's a reporting issue as opposed to real -- realized economic gain or loss. Yes. It's also a relative issue, I mean as the -- a lot of good things are happening in Brazil. But if the US dollar continues to strengthen relative to other currencies around the world that's -- you have a relativity issue as well there.
Ric Prentiss: Right. Although you do get probably some benefit on the escalator side, then as you go through what's happened..
Jeff Stoops: We do. That's on a much more absolute basis and there is some real logical tie to the way the Brazilian currency tracks its own inflator, but not a lot of tie to how the inflator necessarily tracks relative strength with the US dollar. I mean, that's more of a wild-card.
Ric Prentiss: Yes. Okay. And thanks for the extra color.
Operator: Next we have a question from the line of Walter Piecyk from LightShed. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Thanks. Jeff, I'm going to mix it up on you this time and go after the dividend this time as opposed to the share repurchase. You had a couple of quarters and you talked about growth rate or having a growth rate there being appealing to investors. How are you thinking about that in 2020? Is this going to be kind of you put up four quarters of the same dividend and increase it? Have you considered maybe increasing that on a sequential basis that's something, I think it's worked well for Cogent in terms of investing or finding some new investors? Just thoughts on the dividend?
Jeff Stoops: Good question, Walt. We actually have talked to a number of investors about that very concept, because we know Cogent has done it and we know American has done it and actually, no offense to both those companies who I respect quite a bit, but the investors didn't really seem to move one way or the other about it. So we have decided and I tried to make this clear in my comments that we will look at this once a year. So four times at one number and then look for a nice jump.
Walter Piecyk: Okay, got it.
Jeff Stoops: Or in the case of starting halfway through the year, like we did this year, we'll basically be looking to revisit the dividend, every time we look at and give out guidance, which just so happens to be our next release.
Walter Piecyk: Understood. Also, has there been any increase by some of the major telecom operators about kind of a new plan for 2020? I just trying to get a sense of like look T-Mobile was planning on spending on 2.5 and that was going to hit your towers maybe in the first half of 2020 and now things are delayed, there is a low whatever. But have they gone so far as to say, well, maybe if this deal doesn't happen here's some other bands and looking at other towers? Or is it really you don't know until you literally get the orders now say okay now we're putting on these towers in for this spectrum we're using?
Jeff Stoops: No, there is a merger plan and there is a non-merger plan.
Walter Piecyk: My non-merger plan. Got it. And has that always been the case or is the non-merger plan something new that's kind of emerged in a lot of couple of weeks, months, whatever?
Jeff Stoops: No I don't know any details about what that is. I don't know that, but I know that that's a practical discussions at these companies and they'd like to know which way they're going.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. Understood. All right. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Next we have a question from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Frantz: Hey, guys. It's Josh in for Dave. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on your comments on Brazil and the pension reform, outside of the strengthening of real, which we've seen in the past week, like you mentioned. Do you think there's any change in the business on an organic basis based on that, on what kind of could happen in the fall out potentially positive. And then secondly, it looks like Amazon kind of launched their Sidewalk program product, and have you had any discussions with them and so could you share? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. On the Brazil side, I think it's more of a -- the general pension reform, some of the other austerity moves there, I think will in a long-term be healthier for the economy, which should result in a better situation for our customers and carriers, which historically in our business, it's been a virtuous cycle or circle where you've seen that lead to increased spending on the networks. But I think the bigger question that will have more of an impact is really around the stuff that Jeff discussed earlier, which is what happens with the carriers down there, is there some combination? Just the change that we mentioned around the concession rules, I think will be very positive. That's more likely to have a direct impact on our business in a positive way.
Joshua Frantz: Okay. It looks like it's using 900-megahertz spectrum, just not sure kind of this, you've been in touch with them, but --okay, fair enough. Thanks for taking the question, guys.
Operator:  We do have a question from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Thanks for taking the question. I may have missed this, but, Jeff, could you comment just on the level of backlog of signed but not commenced leases from a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter perspective? Then maybe also if you could just comment on more broadly on the labor market for tower climbers that would be great? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: The backlogs are relatively similar as to where they were a year ago and probably a quarter ago, materially similar. And the back -- the tower climbers situation I think is okay for the time being. But it may prove tight once there is resolution on the merger and everybody gets really cooking like I think will be the case when that happens, but we'll see. There's a lot of focus on that, lot of people are getting trained and there are a lot of initiatives underway to make sure that there are enough resources when they are needed.
Brandon Nispel: I guess, if I could follow up on a separate topic, you guys commented on CBRS now you think that's going to be in building solution. Verizon has done some tests using dual-band, I guess dual-band in CBRS with some of their existing spectrum. Have you had any discussions with any of your customers on using CBRS in sort of a dual-band with a couple of spectrum band and carrier aggregation?
Jeff Stoops: We may have in the leasing group and worked into some overall antenna and amendment configs but not that I'm uniquely aware of.
Brandon Nispel: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Next we have a question from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Great. Two questions if I may. There's been some discussion by the cable companies of late that they might look to build out networks on a market-by-market basis to effectively reduce their reliance on roaming from their wireless partners. And I'm just curious if that's something you're starting to have conversations with some of those cable companies about? And then secondly this morning AT&T guided to $20 billion in CapEx from $23 billion in 2019. Now they did acknowledge that part of that is reduced investment in fiber. But I'm curious if you're seeing anything on the -- your side of the business that would suggest that you're also seeing them pull back or expecting to pull back on their investment, as they start to think about leasing for 2020? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I'll take the last one first. I mean, no, all of our comments about timing and pacing are purely temporal and specifically merger-related and should be construed that this is very temporal, has nothing to that is secular or even cyclical. This is -- as soon as this uncertainty is done, this is going to really pop. That's what we believe and the conversations that are ongoing amongst everyone involved are evidence for that and we're right in the middle of all that. So, the answer as it pertains to AT&T, Colby, is no. And as far as the cable companies are concerned, yes, we have had some of those conversations. They're obviously company-specific and if you have certain agreements with certain of those roaming partners, you have a lot less flexibility than others. But I can't really get into any more specifics than that.
Colby Synesael: Do you think it will be just kind of anecdotal in nature and not something we would see from the outside looking in, in terms of having an impact on your numbers at least for the foreseeable future or is it in your opinion pop could happen more rapidly than that and year from now, we could actually be talking in more meaningful manner?
Jeff Stoops: About the cable companies?
Colby Synesael: Yes
Jeff Stoops: No, I think you we'll have to wait and see how they do with these upcoming auctions. And then I think you have to ask that question in a year.
Colby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  There are no further questions in the question queue.
Jeff Stoops: Great. Well we appreciate everyone joining us for the call today and we look forward to our next call, which will be our fourth quarter and full-year guidance call. Thank you.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you. Good evening everyone and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we'll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2019 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, July 29, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had a great second quarter with strong operating and financial results in both our leasing and services businesses. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $459 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $456.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were modestly weaker on average than our estimates for the second quarter, which we've previously provided with our first quarter earnings release, negatively impacting leasing revenues by approximately $350,000. FX rates were also a headwind on year ago comparisons. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 6.4% over the second quarter of 2018, including the impact of 2.4% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 8.8%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 8.3% on a gross basis and 5.6% on a net basis, including 2.7% of churn, a large portion of which continues to be related to Metro/Leap, Clearwire and iDEN consolidation terminations. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth continues to increase, climbing to its highest point in 4 years due to our strong operational domestic leasing activity over the last year. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue signed up during the quarter, was again very solid in the second quarter. Amendment activity in particular was very high, with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming about 80% from amendments and 20% from new leases. We again saw contributions from each of the Big Four carriers. The Big Four carriers represented 86% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. We also continued to have contributions to our domestic operational leasing activity from new lease executions with DISH. Our domestic backlog continues to be strong with new applications coming in every day, giving us confidence for the remainder of the year. Internationally, on a constant-currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 10.2%, including 0.8% of churn or 11% on a gross basis. We had another solid leasing quarter internationally, with Brazil the largest contributor. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.6% on a constant-currency basis, and we continue to have solid contributions from all four major carriers there. During the second quarter, 86.2% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.1% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. With regard to second quarter churn, as we continue to see churn from leases with Metro/Leap and Clearwire a little higher than the previous couple of quarters but consistent with our expectations. As of quarter-end, we have approximately $7 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with Metro/Leap and Clearwire that we expect to ultimately churn off over the next two years. Also, our same-tower churn numbers continue to include the impact of approximately $6 million of annualized churn incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 from certain legacy iDEN-related leases, the impact of which will affect our reported same-tower churn results for one more quarter. Domestic churn in the second quarter from all other tenants on an annual same-tower basis was 1.5%, at the high end of our long-held estimation of 1% to 1.5% of annual non-consolidation churn. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $367.9 million. Our industry-leading domestic tower cash flow margin was 83.4% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 69.2% and was 90.1% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $347.2 million. Our adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were again driven by strong performances in both our leasing and services businesses. Services revenues in the second quarter were $41.1 million, up 55.6% over the second quarter of 2018, driving almost twice as much services gross profit as the year ago period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.8% in the quarter, down slightly year-over-year due to the larger contribution from our services business. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.3%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. AFFO in the second quarter was $240.1 million. AFFO per share was $2.09, an increase of 14.2% over the second quarter of 2018 or 15.8% on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in expanding our tower portfolio, acquiring 82 communication sites for $83 million and building 87 sites. All of the acquired sites were located in the U.S., and most of the built sites were located internationally. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired 59 additional sites for $17.9 million. As of today, we have under contract for acquisition and anticipate closing by the end of the first quarter of 2020 on 125 additional sites at an aggregate price of $45.7 million. In addition, during the third quarter, the company intends to exercise its option to acquire all but 6% of Atlas Tower South Africa, a previously unconsolidated joint venture with sites throughout South Africa. The joint venture currently owns and operates approximately 900 sites, with many more in development. The acquisition is anticipated to close in the third quarter, and the company's 2019 outlook has been updated to include the impact of this transaction. Jeff will discuss this transaction in more detail in a moment. We also continued to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $12.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 35 years. In today's earnings press release, we included our updated outlook for full year 2019. We have increased our outlook across the board. We anticipate increases in site leasing due to both organic and inorganic growth as well as some assumed modest improvements in future FX rates. Increases in organic growth are due to both higher leasing volumes and earlier average timing of rental commencements. Given the typical time delay between lease executions and revenue commencement, we do not expect any material impact to our 2019 leasing guidance as a result of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger. Inorganic growth in our outlook is being boosted primarily by our increased investment in, and consolidation of, our South African joint venture. We also anticipate incremental contributions to our results from our services business due to our strong Q2 performance and our healthy backlogs. However, our full year 2019 services guidance still contemplates a slowdown in the second half of the year due to the Sprint/T-Mobile merger. The balance of our outlook for AFFO has also been improved for anticipated better results in net cash interest expense, non-discretionary CapEx and cash taxes. Shifting gears now, as announced in our earnings press release earlier today, we are excited to be formally initiating a quarterly dividend payment to our common stockholders. The initial dividend will be a payment of $0.37 per share, payable September 25, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 28th, 2019. After our conversion to a REIT in 2016, we have regularly discussed our eventual requirement to pay a dividend upon using up all of our existing federal net operating losses, which were $755 million as of year-end 2018. As previously discussed, the anticipated timing for this was 2021. We have decided to shift the timing of initiating these quarterly cash distributions for several reasons. First, commencing the dividend approximately 18 months earlier will allow us greater flexibility in the amount we pay in the early period following commencement and the pace of growth in the dividend rather than simply being required to pay out all or almost all of our taxable income. The earlier dividend will allow us to preserve a portion of our NOLs for a longer period of time, in turn providing us the opportunity to have steady, more substantial dividend growth over an extended period of time. With the commencement of this dividend and based on our expectation for future growth in our business, we believe we can grow our dividend by at least 20% annually for the next several years. The second reason we have commenced the dividend plan now is that it will allow us to continue to transition our investor base to more traditional REIT investors and other investors who have investment objectives that price free cash flow-generating businesses. We believe commencing our dividend plan now will continue to broaden our investor base and may also facilitate a smoother transition from traditional telecom investors, the REIT, equity income, dividend growth, and other investor classes that place a premium on the growth of a long-term, predictable income stream. And thirdly, initiating a quarterly dividend now requires no strategic or operational changes to our business. The initial dividend level, which is less than 20% of our current AFFO per share, will not require any changes in leverage and will still allow us to focus on building and acquiring high-quality assets as well as opportunistically buying back our stock. Our substantial amount of high-quality, internally-generated cash flow, significant liquidity, and historically strong access to incremental debt capital all give us significant financial flexibility if and when great investment opportunities arise. The dividend will not impact our ability to pursue these opportunities. We are excited to have a new tool to return value to our shareholders for many years to come. I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the second quarter with $9.8 billion of total debt; $150 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments; and $9.6 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9 times, just below the low end of our targeted range of six to 7.5 times. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.6 times. The weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.9%, and our weighted average maturity is approximately four years. As of today, we have no amounts outstanding under our $1.25 billion committed revolver. On May 23rd, we entered into a four-year $750 million interest rate swap, effectively fixing the interest expense on this portion of our outstanding Term Loan B at 4.08%, which is about 20 basis points below the rate we are paying under our term loan today. The unhedged portion of our Term Loan B will continue to accrue interest at one month LIBOR plus 200 basis points. As a result of this transaction, approximately 95% of our debt outstanding is fixed. During the second quarter, we purchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $94.6 million or an average per share price of $204.06. Subsequent to quarter end, on July 29th, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan, replacing the prior $1 billion plan, which had a remaining authorization of $110 million. The new plan authorizes the company to purchase from time to time up to $1 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 or in privately negotiated transaction at management's discretion. Shares repurchased under the plan will be retired. The new plan has no deadline and will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by the company's Board of Directors at any time in its sole discretion. Stock repurchases continue to remain an integral part of our strategy. Our shares outstanding at June 30th, 2019, are 113.1 million, which is down 1.5% from 114.8 million at June 30th, 2018. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. We had a truly great second quarter, exceeding our own expectations both financially and operationally. For the first time in SBA's history, we reported quarterly revenue of $500 million, reflecting the strong financial results from both our leasing and services segments. The strength of these results helped us grow our AFFO per share by 15.8% on a constant-currency basis. The level of operating activity was very high in both leasing and services, and both segments have healthy backlogs moving into the second half of the year. As a result, we have increased our full year 2019 outlook for all key metrics. While it is a little early to be able to comment on the specific implications of the recent announcements regarding the DOJ approval of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger and the related transactions with DISH, we are looking forward to supporting all of our wireless customers in their efforts to build out high-quality, 5G-ready nationwide networks over the next several years. We believe the contemplated final terms of this merger are positive as they insure four facilities-based nationwide carriers, two of which will have significant nationwide deployment deadlines to meet. All of this is positive for the tower industry. Our high-quality, large-scale nationwide network and our existing strong working relationships with our customers position SBA very well for the significant network investment that will take place by our customers for their 5G network deployments. Returning to our second quarter results domestically, the strong operational leasing activity we've experienced over the last few quarters continued into the second quarter. All four major U.S. wireless carriers, as well as DISH, were active during the quarter with significant contributions from amendments. Activity at our tower sites remains predominantly focused on deployment of new spectrum bands, capacity builds and technology upgrades. As the industry accelerates network activity to provide 5G service and with the increasing recognition of low- and mid-band spectrum as a primary component of nationwide 5G networks, we are well positioned in the macro tower business and remain confident in our ability to capture additional organic growth for years to come. Internationally, we also had another solid leasing quarter with steady contributions across all of our markets, particularly Brazil. The contractual revenue signed up during this quarter in our international markets came about 42% from new leases and 58% from amendments. Similar to the last few quarters, we once again had solid contributions from all four major wireless carriers in Brazil. The Brazilian reals has rebounded some as prospects for the Brazilian economy have improved and seems to have settled in around current levels. And as you can tell from our outlook, we've actually put in a more conservative expectation for the rest of the year around the reals. We believe we are very good in identifying high-potential international markets and bring the operational, legal and financial expertise to maximize returns in these markets. In line with that, we are excited to announce our operations in South Africa, our first outside the Western Hemisphere. As mentioned earlier, we intend to exercise our option to acquire all but 6% of Atlas Tower South Africa, a previously unconsolidated joint venture. SBA has been invested in Atlas Tower South Africa for approximately four years. And during that time, Atlas has grown primarily through new tower builds to a current site tower of approximately 900 towers at an average tenancy of 2.2 tenants per tower. Atlas is led by a CEO that I have known for 20 years, Nate Foster. Nate and his wife, Randi, have built a tremendously talented team that build and operate first-class assets with deep customer relationships. Including amounts to be paid in connection with the upcoming closing, we will have invested approximately a cumulative $140 million in Atlas. During the first full year of operation after the acquisition closing date, Atlas is expected to generate annual leasing revenue of approximately $31 million, tower cash flow of approximately $23 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $21 million, all using current exchange rates. Atlas will be neutral to our leverage ratio and immediately accretive to AFFO per share. As you can tell from those numbers, the financial returns on this investment are already quite attractive, but we believe there is significant opportunity for additional high-quality growth in South Africa. South Africa has a number of active wireless carriers, including their Big Four: MTN, Vodacom, Telkom Mobile, and Cell C. All these carriers are still in the process of implementing 4G, which we anticipate will continue for the next couple of years at least as well as focusing on cell densification efforts. These projects, in addition to anticipated new spectrum options and ultimately 5G deployments, we expect will keep us very busy for the foreseeable future. New spectrum options of 700 megahertz, 800 megahertz and 2.6 gigahertz are expected soon in South Africa. In addition to a healthy and active wireless market, South Africa also has other characteristics that are well suited for the tower business, including an established rule of law, stable land-use regulations and direct availability of electric power. As it relates to power, each customer has their own power meter, and all of the sites are connected to the power grid, which is a major difference from virtually all other sub-Saharan African tower markets. In addition, our involvement with the joint venture from very early on has allowed us to witness the high quality of both the contracts and the towers being built. We believe the experience of the Atlas management team and their focus on quality has made this the top portfolio in this market. From a macro level, with the recently completed elections, we are optimistic about the prospects for South Africa, with an administration that we expect to be supportive of business, particularly those businesses focused on critical infrastructure like communications infrastructure as well as the desire to attract foreign investment. Our contracts and operating expenses are all denominated in the South African rand, which has been a relatively steady currency against the U.S. dollar over the past three years. We're truly thrilled to be in South Africa. It gives us a well-scaled access to a new high-growth market and a high-quality local team who has a strong track record of organically growing the business. This is exactly the type of portfolio growth we see allocating capital towards high-returning tower assets that drive incremental value for our shareholders. We look forward to reporting on our progress in South Africa over the next several years. Moving on from one exciting announcement to another, SBA today declared its first cash dividend. Brendan went through most of our thinking around initiating a cash dividend now, but the bottom line is we believe it is simply another way for us to create value for our shareholders. The strength of our operating results and financial condition, along with the future flexibility created for managing the dividend, made it an easy decision for us to begin today. The level of the initial dividend in our current existing NOL balance allow us the ability to continue to meaningfully invest in new assets and share repurchases while still providing the same incremental benefit to our shareholders. We are very pleased to add dividends to the list of ways we target to return value to our shareholders. With the initiation of a dividend, our toolkit for additional value creation for our shareholders is now complete. Our recipe for maximizing shareholder value stays largely the same but changes slightly as to capital allocation. First, we will continue to have a laser focus on operational excellence as we always have. Second, we will look to continue to optimize and appropriately leverage our balance sheet, and we continue to pursue that goal from a position of great strength. Balance sheet optimization drives the target amount of capital allocation each year. With the initiation of the dividend, our first priority is now to grow the dividend materially each year, satisfying our REIT distribution requirement along the way, yet while keeping the vast majority of our AFFO available for portfolio growth. This is the primary reason why we started the dividend ahead of our REIT requirements. Our next priority is quality portfolio growth that meets or exceeds our investment criteria. Our U.S. tower acquisitions this quarter and our South African news are perfect examples of the types of portfolio growth we will continue to see. Finally, to the extent we have capital remaining available for allocation; we will repurchase our stock where we believe it is trading below intrinsic value. We did some of that as well this quarter. So, this quarter, with the initiation of the dividend, represents a great example of our use of all three capital allocation tools to create additional shareholder value. We've had a great first half of 2019 and are excited about what the future holds for SBA. I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their contributions to our success. And with that, Caroline, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from the line of Batya Levi from UBS Company. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you. Maybe one question. If you could remind us your exposure to T-Mobile's and Sprint's decommissioning spend. And how quickly do you think that you could potentially see that impact? And I guess from -- looking at DISH potential deployment, you've had potentially more insight than others into how they've been planning the network. How do you think you're positioned to benefit from the incremental tower that they are announcing that they're going to spend? And how quickly do you think you will be able to see that revenue growth accretion? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Batya, on the Sprint and T-Mobile overlap, we actually did put the information on the press release. But it is -- in terms of site, both companies have leases on the same site. Sprint represents 6.4% of our consolidated cash site leasing revenue, and T-Mobile represents 6.5%, so fairly equivalent in size. And the average remaining term for the Sprint leases on those dates is 4.6 years. And for T-Mobile, it's 4.3 years. So there wouldn't be any immediate impact from that. DISH?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And on DISH, I would say that we do have an excellent relationship with DISH, and I would believe that will suit us particularly well for the future. But I would also guess, and this would only be a guess at this point, that there will be a fair amount of consideration on their part as to what they will want their network to look like going forward under the new firms, what has been divested from the Sprint/T-Mobile deal because it will look very different than what, I believe, their narrowband IoT network was going to look like under their prior efforts. So, there's got to have to be some time that goes by before I think you can have clarity on what DISH's exact plans are going to be and with the time frame is going to be.
Batya Levi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have a question from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Great. I guess so just a follow-up on that. So, DISH is then in theory, I guess, leasing sites with you for their narrowband IoT network, which they're, in theory, no longer going to be pursuing. Is it possible we could actually see a pause now in terms of the demand that you're seeing from them? And could that have some impact on your expectations? And then to that point, was there any provision in the leases that they did sign that allows them to cancel then to the extent something like this happen or either shift those leases into a more -- maybe the dollar commitment, if you will, that they were using for the narrowband IoT network, they can shift those dollars towards leases from more traditional network? And then secondly and separately for South Africa, I know you mentioned that this is very unique and there is a relationship that's already there. But is it possible that we could see you now going into other countries in Africa? Or is this really a one-off, and we should think of it that way? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Well, we don't have any plans at this point to do anything beyond South Africa, which is like we decided to go into South Africa. It's our job to continue to evaluate every place around the globe, but we're not. So, nothing on the horizon today, but stay tuned. And as far as DISH is concerned, their leases are -- they have the regular terms. They don't have any particular outs for something like this, Colby. So, we'll have to see what this -- yes, I mean, this is a pretty big change. It's a different kind of network for them. So, we'll have to see what all this does to their efforts going forward. But as far as our guidance is concerned, there's really not anything that is left to be done operationally in 2019 that affects the outlook that we've given, given the lag between operational lease-up and the impact on the financial statement. So, whatever happens, we're very comfortable with the new outlook that we've put out.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have a question from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, This is [Indiscernible] for Phil. Thank you for taking my question. Two, if I may. First, domestic churn has been a little more elevated over the past few quarters. Can you talk about the trends you're seeing there? And should we still expect iDEN to fall to 0 after 4Q? And then secondly and separately, we've seen a pickup of site development as a percentage of site leasing revenue. Is this a reflection of normal course leasing activity or maybe a shift in a way in which carriers are choosing to architect their networks? Thanks very much.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I'll take the churn question. On the domestic churn, there has been no change in behavior from anybody. We do expect on the iDEN side, most of that churn was fourth quarter event that happened October 1st of last year. So, when we report that, we're giving you basically the impact over trailing 12 months. So, next quarter and the third quarter, we'll show that one more time on a year-over-year basis. When we get to the fourth quarter, we would expect that it probably will drop to zero. In terms of the other non-consolidation churn, we've seen a slight uptick, but it's really a timing issue. We've -- we're still comfortable with our annual 1% to 1.5% churn range in a given period. It might be slightly higher than that. As you've seen in the past, it's also been slightly lower, but we're still comfortable with that being kind of a normal level for the coming years.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And with respect to services, there's not really any change in the way our customers architect their network. I mean what it really reflects is we were doing a lot of services business for Sprint, which we did in the first half. And as we've discussed now several quarters, we're not contemplating that same level of business in the second half of 2019 from that particular customer. Caroline, do we have another question?
Operator: We do, from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thanks very much. Brendan, can you just talk about the leverage policy now that you've initiated a dividend? I think in the past, you've talked about kind of getting it more into the mid-6s. So, any update there? And perhaps, Jeff, just a broader comment on the M&A environment. In the U.S., I think you bought some towers. AT&T talked about potentially selling some towers last week. What are you seeing there in terms of supply and valuations, et cetera? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the leverage, Simon, what we have said in the past is that we would look to have something with a six handle on it. We actually have that today. We obviously reported 6.9 turns. I think it's really going to be driven more by opportunities to continue to add quality portfolio growth in share repurchases, but we would expect to still be close to our historical target range of 7% to 7.5% but probably more towards the lower end going forward.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. The M&A environment, Simon, continues to be competitive, but you can find if you're experienced and have a lot of tentacles out there, which we have both, good opportunities. We tend to focus on the -- we try to tend to focus on the highest quality site. The particular sites that we bought in the second quarter were Mid-Atlantic area sites; extremely tough zoning; very, very good high-quality sites that we think will enjoy very good growth over the years. Those are the kind of things that are out there. And we will be very, I think, competitive around those types of opportunities. Not everything out there fits that bill, so you have to be careful and picky, but there's enough out there for us globally to achieve the high-quality exclusive asset characteristics that we've kind of built the company on and we'll continue to seek over time.
Simon Flannery: Great. So, you still have that 5% to 10% goal over the next few years?
Jeff Stoops: We do. We'll hit it this year, for sure, and I don't know why it wouldn't be a go going into next year as well.
Simon Flannery: Thanks a lot.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey thanks for taking my question. Regarding Atlas, a few questions there. One, is the leadership team going to remain in place? Two, can you talk about the new build runway and sort of development yields they've been getting? And three, how much are you spending in Q3 to bring ownerships stake up and for what share of the company?
Jeff Stoops: We're not going to cover the last one, Nick. That's got to be between us and the Fosters. As to the first question, the -- yes, they are staying on, and they have arrangements and build-to-suit relationships with all four of the South African carriers. So, this -- the beauty of this opportunity is that most all of these towers were built, and they were built for -- in varying amounts for the Big Four in South Africa. That will continue, and they've been running at a fairly high annual clip. So, we expect that the 900 goes to 1,000 and beyond here in the not-too-distant future. 
Nick Del Deo: Okay. And any commentary on the development yields?
Jeff Stoops: Development yields?
Nick Del Deo: Yes, sure, sure.
Jeff Stoops: Day one? You mean the day one of yields?
Nick Del Deo: Yes, and anything you can kind of share.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I think they would be high single-digits or perhaps low double-digit on day one.
Nick Del Deo: Got it. And then I guess, and sort of switching gears a bit, when you look at acquisitions in general, you go tower by tower, lease by lease. How do you underwrite value contributions from upstart carriers relative to established players? Yes, I guess I'm trying to understand what your general framework is because it might be useful as we think through what DISH might mean for you guys.
Jeff Stoops: How we value them?
Nick Del Deo: Yes, what are the puts and takes you consider for upstarts versus established players?
Jeff Stoops: Well, it really comes down to whether you're allocating capital. Are you building for them? Are you buying for them? Or are you simply leasing up space that you have available on asset that you've already spent money. That's -- and that's a wildly different outcome depending on which of those camps you fall in.
Brendan Cavanagh: I'm sorry, Nick, I was just going to say we deal on our existing sites to evaluate obviously whether there's any remaining capacity when we're making that decision and who might be a potential user of that if there are. But for the vast majority of our sites, we're not leasing the last available space so it's not really a credit quality decision that we're making. 
Nick Del Deo: Okay, okay. It was the latter point I was trying to get to. Thanks for the commentary Jeff and Brendan.
Operator: Next, we have a question from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Hi, thanks and good afternoon. Two, if I could. First, if you can give us an update on site leasing activity in the U.S. with respect to what you're seeing from new colo versus amendment. And second, I think over the last couple of quarters, you've been talking about a broadening of your investor base. I'm curious, as you've had an opportunity to talk more with your investors, are you seeing any change in priorities for them in terms of what they would like to you to do as a company whether it's the way you invest or allocate capital. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the amendments versus new colos in the U.S., I think we mentioned in our comment what it was this quarter, which was in terms of the business that we signed up in the U.S.; it was approximately 80% of amendment. That is pretty high relative to where it's been over the last few quarters or actually over the last two years. Amendments have, generally speaking, always been higher over the last probably five-plus years than new colos, but it has gone a little bit higher in recent periods. And that's probably the highest we've had in a couple of years. So, we'll see, but we would expect to continue to see that kind of mix given the types of activity that our customers are involved in. 
Jeff Stoops: Yes, on your second question, Mike, we are seeing more of the traditional REIT infrastructure investor. That investor typically looks for some kind of dividend. In fact, we have had a number of interested investors who previously said they were very interested but precluded from their internal policies and charters because we did not pay a dividend. But in each case, we made it clear that our bias at our internal policy was such that it was going to be a minimal dividend going or a dividend on the lower side geared towards maximizing AFFO that was left for other investment, obviously subject to our REIT requirements. And everybody seemed to be very happy with that because they understood that, that was going to satisfy the dividend requirement that they were looking for and also provide over time a very fast growing dividend. So, in large part -- not entirely, but in large part, what we did today was responsive to a lot of that new class of folks that you were inquiring about and we've been recently meeting with.
Michael Rollins: Thanks very much.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Spencer Kurn from New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn: Hey thanks for taking the question. I want to follow-up on leverage. So, I know you have a six handle today. Can you just talk about -- I mean so first off, should we sort of think about you being in the high-6s for the foreseeable future? And then can you talk about the considerations you have to make in leverage as your payout ratio grows over the next five years? 
Jeff Stoops: We definitely have to consider that. As the payout ratio grows, that is another reason to start smaller because it keeps the payouts smaller for more years. So, that definitely was a factor, Spencer. We'll see where we -- where leverage ultimately comes in, whether it's higher or lower. Big factor there is where interest rates settle out, and interest rates appear to be headed lower again rather than higher. So, that's going to bode towards perhaps a higher six handle than a lower six handle. It's the same thing that we factored in before. But instead of before, where we had no calls on our cash flows, now we have the dividend call and then we back in from there. But the basic premise of a leverage capital structure as the most rewarding for equity holders, that hasn't changed.
Spencer Kurn: Got it, makes sense. And if I might just switch gears for a second to Sprint and T-Mobile. Could you just run through thoughts on when carriers consolidate, do you tend to see a pause in spending before they ratchet up their new network plans? Or can you just talk about what you're expecting as a result of that merger? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, I don't know that any historical consolidation is going to be instructed here because none have ever had the aggressive date-specific coverage requirements for the 5G service that are a part of the Sprint/T-Mobile transaction, the percentage of the population that must be covered within three years. So, I think there's going to be a lot of activity early on.
Spencer Kurn: Got it. And just one more from me. It looks like you had a nice sequential increase in new leasing activity in the U.S. this quarter. What does your guidance imply for the rest of the year? Pretty consistent with second quarter levels or do you see the opportunity for it to continue to rise for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, based on where our guidance is set and the numbers that are sort of implied in the bridge, I'd assume you're talking about the same-tower growth percentage, it would imply that from the domestic standpoint that we will be fairly consistent with where we were for the second quarter during the second half of the year.
Spencer Kurn: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we have a question from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey guys. Thanks. I guess just one for Brendan or Mark. I think, Mark, you said that now that you kind of have done this refinancing, you're at 95% fixed. Historically, you've expressed your comfort level with 20% variable. And to Jeff's point, your rates seem to be trending down again. That might be a little bit of a surprise from kind of where we were a year ago. So, what is the strategy now? Is it to become more incrementally variable as we look ahead for the next year? Or is it just to fix everything we can now that rates are kind of coming back down again? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, we don't -- we're not planning to fix anything more than what we've already done. For the most part, our floating exposure throughout our history has come through our bank debt, and that is not due to mature for quite some time. Depending on how rates move there, we would evaluate whether it makes sense at any point to refinance it. But for now I think you should expect to see it stay about where it is.
David Barden: Great. And then just with respect to the reals and your kind of expectations in Brazil for the kind of foreseeable future, are you -- I don't know, I guess the question is, are you banking on bows and arrows kind of government being able to kind of wane in the reals? And kind of would you expect to see tightening? And maybe could there be potential to see some opportunities for more affordable hedging in that marketplace or are you kind of not prepared to make the call on the market right now and just kind of ride it out?
Jeff Stoops: Well, we haven't -- let's -- what you just suggested is not really a part of our outlook. What we believe has a very strong possibility is pension reform. I believe we're one vote away. And if that happens, we think that unlocks all kinds of favorable economic moves down there that will result not only in a strengthening of the currency against the U.S. dollar, which may weaken of its own accord, but also a favorable telecom regulation, which could be to the benefit of the entire wireless world down there. There's a number of things that are actually very favorable that are kind of right on the cusp of occurring down there, and it's already actually a pretty good market relative to where it's been in several years ago.
David Barden: Okay, great. Thanks Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: I would just add that no matter -- I mean, the reals could improve by a whole dollar against the U.S., but the cost of operationally hedging your results down there, I don't know if that ever becomes economically viable. I know people would like to believe that, but I don't know of any company that's ever successfully done that. Go ahead Carol.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Okay, sweet. I'm not going to talk about T-Mobile/Sprint, but I'm curious on your backlog of activity. In terms of new leases signed but not commenced, have we seen that level of backlog increase? And maybe could you remind us where it's at compared to a year ago? And then another one. Just in terms of the potential amount of activity that could be coming, what are the key constraints in terms of tower climbers? I guess do you see any labor shortages coming? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. Backlog is up from a year ago, but probably flat to six months ago. And tower climbers and other resources are short and at a premium and probably are somewhat restraining the pace of activity that would otherwise be able to be done.
Brandon Nispel: Great. Thanks.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the question queue.
Jeff Stoops: Great. Well, we appreciate everyone joining us and we look forward to reporting our next quarter's call. Thank you.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA First Quarter Results Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder the conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to our host Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead Sir.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2019 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 29, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brendan to comment on our first quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks, Mark. Good evening. We had a very solid start to the year with strong operating and financial results in both our leasing and services businesses. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $452.1 million and cash site leasing revenues were $449.5 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our estimates for the first quarter, which we previously provided with our fourth quarter earnings release, only modestly impacting our results. They were however still a headwind on year ago comparisons. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 5.9% over the first quarter of 2018 including the impact of 2.1% of churn. On a gross basis same-tower growth was 8%, domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 7.5% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis including 2.4% of churn. A large portion of which continues to be related to Metro/Leap, Clearwire, and iDEN terminations Domestic same-tower, recurring cash leasing revenue growth on a gross basis continues to increase climbing to its highest point in 2.5 years reflecting our strong operational domestic leasing activity over the last year. Domestic operational leasing activity representing new revenues signed up during the quarter was again very solid in the first quarter. This quarter, we saw a bit of a shift back in favor of amendments with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming about 68% from amendments and 32% from new leases. We continue to see contributions from each of the big four carriers. The big four carriers represented 82% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter. We also again had a nice contribution to our domestic operational leasing activity from DISH, who continues to be active executing new lease agreements. While we executed a lot of new business in the quarter, our domestic backlog continues to restock itself as our customers remain active, giving us confidence for the remainder of the year Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 9.8%, including 0.5% of churn or 10.3% on a gross basis. Gross same tower organic growth in Brazil was 12.2% on a constant currency basis. We had another solid leasing quarter internationally with Brazil again being one of the largest contributors. In Brazil, we continue to have solid contributions from Claro, Vivo, Oi, and TIM. During the first quarter, 86.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.3% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. With regard to first quarter churn, we continue to see churn from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire consistent with our expectations. As of quarter-end, we have approximately $9 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with Metro, Leap, and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next two years. Also as mentioned on our last earnings call in the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $6 million of annualized churn from certain legacy iDEN-related leases. The impact of which will affect our reported same tower churn results for the first three quarters of 2019. Domestic churn in the first quarter from all other tenants on an annual same tower basis was 1.3%. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $362.9 million. Our industry leading domestic tower cash flow margin increased to 83.5% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin increased to 69.2% and was 90% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $345.6 million. Our adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were again driven by strong performances in both our leasing and services businesses. Services revenues in the first quarter were $41.1 million, up 48.1% over the first quarter of 2018 driving almost twice as much services gross profit as a year ago period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.4% in the quarter, the same as the year earlier period notwithstanding the larger contribution from our services business. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.9%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. AFFO in the first quarter was $236.1 million. AFFO per share was $2.07, an increase of 11.9% over the first quarter of 2018 or 14.6% on a constant currency basis. During the first quarter in accordance with the Oi reorganization plan approved by the Brazilian court, we received a payment of BRL 11.2 million, which represents a partial recovery of pre-petition obligations owed to SBA from Oi. Net of costs we incurred in connection with this bankruptcy process, the U.S. dollar recovery during the quarter was $2.3 million, which resulted in a partial recovery of our allowance for doubtful accounts. We reported this amount as an offset to bad debt expense within selling, general, and administrative expenses. As a result, this recovery positively impacted adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $2.3 million and AFFO per share by $0.03. The reorganization plan calls for additional payments of pre-petition receivables to be made by Oi over the next three years. We will record these payments in a similar manner as they are received. No additional payments are due under this plan during 2019. During the first quarter, we continued to invest in expanding our tower portfolio, acquiring 54 communication sites for $36.1 million and building 72 sites. Most of the added sites were located internationally. As of today, we have under contract for acquisition and anticipate closing by the end of the third quarter on 256 additional sites at an aggregate price of $123.9 million. We also continued to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.4 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years, the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is approximately 36 years. In today's earnings press release, we included our updated outlook for full year 2019. We’ve increased our outlook across the board. We anticipate increases in site leasing due to both organic and inorganic growth. Increases in organic growth are primarily due to earlier average timing of rental commencements in large part as a result of a higher concentration of leasing activity coming from amendments versus new leases. The increase in our anticipated leasing results is being partially offset by incremental negative changes in our foreign currency rate assumptions for the remainder of the year, primarily in Brazil. The changes in these currency assumptions negatively impacted our outlook for site leasing revenue by $4.5 million, tower cash flow by $3 million and adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $2.7 million. We also anticipate incremental contributions to our results from our services business due to our strong Q1 performance and our healthy backlogs. However, our full year 2019 services guidance still contemplates a slowdown in the second half of the year due to the Sprint/T-Mobile transaction. The balance of our outlook for AFFO has also been improved for anticipated better results in net cash interest expense and nondiscretionary CapEx, offset by slightly higher tax expectations. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share has also been negatively impacted by about $0.04, due to a change in our assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares for the year of 114.9 million, which assumption is influenced in part by increases in our current and estimated future share prices. We are very pleased with how the year has started and are optimistic about the rest of 2019. I'll now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Brendan. SBA ended the first quarter with $9.7 billion of net debt, and our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7x, at the low end of our targeted range of 7x to 7.5x. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.6x. The weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.9%, and our weighted average maturity is approximately four years. As of today, we had $50 million outstanding under our $1.25 billion committed revolver. As mentioned on our last earnings call, during the first quarter, we entered into a four-year $1.2 billion interest rate swap, effectively fixing the interest expense at 4.49% on approximately half of our outstanding 2018 Term Loan B. As a result of this transaction, approximately 88% of our nonrevolver debt outstanding is fixed. The company did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the two months since our last earnings call. Stock repurchases, however, are still an integral part of our strategy. As of today, we have $204.5 million of authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2019, are $113.2 million, which is down 2.8% from $116.5 million at March 31, 2018. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. Our first quarter was about a simple, straightforward and solid as we could have hoped for. We exceeded our expectations across all financial metrics. We continued to see healthy, operational leasing activity, and our services business again had another very strong quarter. While it has only been two months since our last earnings call, we feel like a lot has happened, particularly around improved clarity for the remainder of 2019. As a result, we are able to increase our full year outlook. Domestically, the strong operational leasing activity we saw in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter of 2019. All four major U.S. wireless carriers were active during the quarter to varying degrees with particular increases in new technology and capacity-related upgrades, pushing our amendment business to the highest quarterly contribution in over a year. We also saw continued contributions from DISH who remains busy with their Phase 1 network build-out. Our leasing application backlogs remain very strong, giving us confidence in continued steady lease-up results in Q2 and beyond. Internationally, we also had another solid leasing quarter with steady contributions across all of our markets, led once again by Brazil. The contractual revenue signed up during this quarter in our international markets came about 48% from new leases and 52% from amendments, though it continues to be very balanced between coverage builds and technology upgrades. Similar to last quarter, we had solid contributions from all four major wireless carriers in Brazil. Although, the currency has continued to weaken a little bit, operationally, we remain on target for strong growth in Brazil once again this year or, as Brendan mentioned earlier, but for the weakening of the currency, our 2018 outlook would have been increased even more. We continue to be optimistic about the opportunities that exist throughout all of our international markets. During the first quarter, we spent limited amounts of discretionary capital on new asset additions and no capital on share repurchases in the two months since our last earnings call. As a result, we saw our leverage quickly dropped to the low end of our target leverage range at 7.0x. This drop in leverage in one quarter demonstrates how quickly we can organically delever and the flexibility that exists within our capital structure. We do expect investment to increase through the remainder of 2019. We are still committed to growing our portfolio 5% to 10% this year through disciplined acquisitions and new builds. We, of course, focus on growing our portfolio throughout our existing markets, but we also regularly explore opportunities in other markets. Our focus has always been and continues to be on finding accretive tower opportunities to create shareholder value and frankly, avoiding those that do not. We believe we are very good at this, and we will continue to maintain it as a key component of our strategy. In addition, stock repurchases will also remain an important part of our value proposition. We have always been opportunistic around repurchases and did not have any of the market dislocations; we typically look for in stock repurchases so we did not repurchase any shares in the last two months. For our desire to repurchase shares under the right circumstances hasn't changed. I'm confident that we will have a nice mix of both quality portfolio additions and share repurchases throughout 2019. Our capital structure continues to be one of our greatest assets. We have significant liquidity and tremendous access to sizable incremental capital across a diverse set of financing markets. Our capital structure and industry-leading AFFO per share affords us great flexibility to use our resources to drive shareholder value in a variety of ways. In addition to tower investments and share repurchases, we continue to explore and pursue new business initiatives related to our existing businesses. These initiatives are not material today, but we are excited about the potential for the opportunities we are currently exploring. We're off to a good start in 2019 and are operationally performing at a very high level. This year, we celebrate two anniversaries: 30 years in business and 20 years as a public company. We are within striking distance of two important milestones: 30,000 sites and $2 billion in revenue. I'm very excited about what the future holds for SBA. I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their contributions to our success. And with that, Laurie, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great, thanks very much. Thanks for the commentary on the balance sheet and the buybacks. Where do you draw the line on your leverage? If you didn't have an opportunity to do buybacks or a lot more M&A, would you be prepared to let the leverage drop down into the high-6s? Or would you want to keep it in that 7 to 7.5 range? And then if you could just provide a little bit more color on the services strength, very strong, you talked about it potentially slowing down there, but what was behind that strength this quarter? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, ideally, we do want to keep it in the 7x to 7.5x range, Simon, but we don't want to spend money just for the sake of spending money either. And what we have not yet implemented is kind of a mechanical stock repurchase program that would be implemented just for the sake of maintaining leverage. We're hesitant to do that because we haven't had to do that frankly. We've always had the opportunity to be opportunistic around stock repurchases and we'd like to continue to believe that, that will be afforded to us by the market. In terms of the services business, we do work for all the carriers, but one of the – including a fair amount of work for Sprint, and as we noted in the press release and as Brendan said in his comments, we had to take a position on the Sprint/T-Mobile transaction. So while we expect to continue to do a lot of work right up through the end of the second quarter, at least with respect to Sprint on the services side, we're taking the position that the deal ends or the deal gets approved, rather, and that there is no more Sprint as of June 30. Now whether that happens or not, we of course don't really know, but we had to take a position for purposes of guidance, but the services business is very, very busy right now. And that has rolled into the second quarter, and that of course the combination of what we did in the first quarter where we see things today in the second quarter was the reason we were able to move the full year outlook up.
Simon Flannery: I mean, is this related to 5G rollout or what’s the kind of…?
Jeff Stoops: Well, I mean, not all the customers that we're doing business are really on the 5G trail, so it's really a mix of everything. It's just a high level of activity, which is really what's also behind our leasing business.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go to Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: Yes. So a couple of questions, one, I was wondering as you look at the international business, how do you think about kind of the longer term growth rate? And are there any potential needle movers to call out ex-Brazil? And then secondly, I was interested in kind of any update on edge computing and the opportunity that you see there perhaps that's tied in with small cells or not, but what are your current thoughts on that? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. Some of the international markets, Jon, are ahead of Brazil slightly, now some are lagging, but the issue really is that Brazil is so much bigger than frankly any of our other markets. The thing that gives us confidence around all of the markets is they are well behind the U.S. in terms of their technology upgrades. There's still a lot of 3G work being done in some of these markets, let alone 4G and in some cases, and no 5G whatsoever. So we do think that there will be a lot of work in the future coming out of these markets. Obviously, there has to be an economy and an ecosystem to pay for all that just by carrier expenditures, but we do think that just as in the U.S., that will be the case. In terms of the mobile edge computing, we continue to take the steps to prepare ourselves for the day when there will be material revenue opportunities that come from that. We continue to believe that day will come. I can't tell you when that day will be. We've had some good traction with the one deployment that we've been working on with Packet outside of Gillette Stadium, I mean, number of folks who have come through Packet to deploy in that facility. A lot of discussion is going on, but in terms of actual material revenue production, I think we're still a bit of ways away. It's certainly not going to come in 2019.
Jon Atkin: Okay. And then you mentioned the Phase 1 build-out and the leasing that you continue to see there. Is equipment actually going up?
Jeff Stoops: Absolutely.
Jon Atkin: And then lastly, the ground buyback activity. Is there anyway – I don't think there is, but I just thought I’d check, is there any way to kind of ramp that if you wanted to – around the ground lease repurchases?
Jeff Stoops: No. We have plenty of capital spend in that. That business has always really been governed more by the particular situation of the seller. These are all individuals who might say no three different times, and then say yes on the fourth time. So, it's – we've tried to do that. It's really not – it's not an operational issue as much as it is the seller desire issue, Jon. That may sound a little crazy, but after 15 years of pulling all the different levers, that's kind of how it goes.
Jon Atkin: Right. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go to Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Phil Cusick: Hey guys, a couple of follow-ups and a new one. First on the DISH contribution, should we think of that as a bigger part of the services business today? And is that ramping through the year?
Jeff Stoops: It's a part of the services business. I don't know if it's a bigger part of the services business.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. It's kind of small part of our services business. It may increase as the year goes on as a percentage of services, but I don't think it's so big that it makes a huge difference.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. It's not the reason that went from the fourth quarter number to the first quarter number.
Brendan Cavanagh: Correct.
Phil Cusick: Okay. And then on the leverage side, nobody has mentioned the dividend yet, but you've talked about doing that within the next couple of years. If the shares stay at this level or somewhere around here, does it make sense to pull that forward as a way to maintain leverage rather than buying back stock?
Brendan Cavanagh: I mean, it could. It’d be something to add to the list of things to look at.
Phil Cusick: Right. If buybacks aren't as accretive as they used to be, maybe the dividend instead or is that – does the dividend timing – is it driven more by the size of NOL that you want to maintain over time or could that be…
Brendan Cavanagh: We've always only talked about the dividend in terms of when we first had to start paying it.
Phil Cusick: Right, which is 2021 you talked about?
Brendan Cavanagh: Correct.
Phil Cusick: So pulling that forward, especially the share price isn't as accretive?
Brendan Cavanagh: That is a possibility that is available to us.
Phil Cusick: Got it. And then last one. You've talked in the past about a little bit of competitive churn. I know AT&T and T-Mobile both have guys who are working on some new builds for them to overbuild you and your peers. Any shift in the pace of that, positive or negative?
Jeff Stoops: No. No changes really there.
Phil Cusick: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: And we'll go to Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. First one, if I could. On one of the slides, you provided an update on churn on invested capital, which is about 10.3% at the end of the first quarter. How does that compare between the domestic business and the international business? And how do you think about current valuations for assets relative to your return objectives? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, it's higher domestically, mostly due to just obviously the maturity of that. We'll had those assets for so long and we haven't decided to give those numbers out because it's a little bit immature from an international standpoint. But that's something we'll consider breaking down in the future, but higher domestically just because the international stuff is less mature.
Brendan Cavanagh: Although in some countries, it's higher. There are individual countries where it has the highest return on invested capital.
Jeff Stoops: And yes, you got to clearly think about those things, Mike, in terms of current pricing versus price matters. Absolutely.
Michael Rollins: And in terms of what you're seeing out there, is it just getting tougher? Or is it getting easier in terms of the opportunities for asset purchases?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, I wouldn't say it's getting easier. I mean, it's – there's a lot of capital and it is price competitive. You have to be very patient and you have to look hard and you have to be knowledgeable about the wheat and the chaff.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Laurie, I think we’re ready for another question.
Operator: Very good, thank you. We’ll go to Ric Prentiss, Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon guys.
Jeff Stoops: Hey Ric.
Ric Prentiss: Hey, I want to follow-up on a couple on previous questions. Simon was asking on the leverage side, and you talked about the portfolio. It looks like the portfolio growth in the first quarter was probably less than a percent. And even if we add in the sites under contract through the end of third quarter, it's still kind of in the one-plus percent range. So are you seeing some bigger transactions out there that could get you into the target zone of 5% to 10% portfolios given that the answer to Mike there was that prices are getting tougher?
Brendan Cavanagh: We think that there will be some opportunities along those lines, yes.
Ric Prentiss: And you kind of alluded to that maybe some new markets might be popping under the screen?
Brendan Cavanagh: No, I don't think I said that. I think we say we like to stay in our existing markets, but we’ll look everywhere that makes sense to look.
Ric Prentiss: Okay, okay. That’s good. And then with Phil's question on the leverage and the dividend, have you thought about kind of what that payout ratio of AFFO might look like crown when they convert and started paying dividend kind of with the full payment. American Tower has kind of been in that we're going to grow it for a long time, which way should we think about you guys looking at the – when the dividend day does come with the path might look like?
Brendan Cavanagh: The latter.
Ric Prentiss: The more like American Tower is kind of keep it growing?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. And then the last one for me on the leverage. As we think about 2019 and 2020 and 2021, where does leverage need to go as you start looking to pay a dividend?
Jeff Stoops: Doesn't have to go much lower than it is right now. We've talked about something with the six handle on it.
Ric Prentiss: I did have one more. I apologize. Amendment versus colo, you talked about how amendments had gone to about 68% of new revenue and colos with 32%. If you get a customer who comes in who's already a customer on your tower and they want to put more equipment on the tower but a different RAD center, is that a new colocation or is that an amendment?
Jeff Stoops: Depends on whether they bring it under their existing contract, in which event it would be an amendment or a brand-new conduct in which event would be a lease.
Ric Prentiss: And just hypothetically say, our first NAT type project with AT&T, is that going to be seen more as an amendment actually, I’m just trying to think of how we're gauging what's the base of business coming in?
Jeff Stoops: If it's under the existing contract, it's an amendment. If it's a new contract, it's a lease.
Ric Prentiss: Yes, that helps. Okay, thanks Jeff.
Operator: And we'll go to Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Thanks. Domestically, your amendment to colo growth has accelerated for the last five quarters, I guess or so. Yes, it looks like five. Jeff, is that could happen throughout 2019 just sequential accelerations in that annual growth rate for the amendments to colos and escalations, I guess, just your gross growth, the 7.5 number you reported this quarter I don't know what you call it.
Jeff Stoops: Are you talking about the growth rate or the rate of amendments to colos?
Walter Piecyk: I’m talking about the 7.5%, which I call it growth rate, every company call that I think something different so.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, the answer is yes. Well, if you look at the revenue bridge for the domestic, it implies, obviously, a higher full year number. And given where we are, it has to increase throughout the year or so we'll expect it to increase each quarter.
Walter Piecyk: And then Jeff, you had mentioned that in your guidance, assumes that the Sprint/T-Mobile deal is approved, so if it's not approved, does that mean those numbers are higher or lower?
Jeff Stoops: Well, we don't know. I mean, we’ll have to see what comes. I mean, it's hard to – we don't really know what the plan B is if there is one.
Walter Piecyk: Got you. So it's possible it could be lower than if Plan B is…
Jeff Stoops: I don’t – no, no, no. I don't think so. Because right now our guidance assumes that basically, there's nothing else from Sprint.
Walter Piecyk: Okay, got it.
Brendan Cavanagh: I mean, it's really two – if you look at the two pieces, its services where there's an impact we assume that, that's lower in the second half of the year because there's really nothing from Sprint. I don't think that could be lower. The question is whether really it would be higher if the deal didn’t happen, and we're not sure about that. And on the leasing side, there's probably very little impact because any slowdown that might occur or increase that might occur, the deal doesn’t happen, in either case, it's not going to impact this year's numbers too much.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. And last question. I mean, I don't know if you're planning on put up like an 8% dividend yield, but I guess is generally speaking, if you're not willing to buy stock, why should investors be buying your stock right now?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, it's only been two months since our last earnings call.
Walter Piecyk: I understand that but the message…
Brendan Cavanagh: I didn't say we're not willing to buy our stock. I said as we move through the year, I'm confident we're going to invest our capital in towers and stock.
Walter Piecyk: Got you. I just – seemed like I take to the response to Phil's question was like you think the stock, you're not getting accretion. I mean, those were Phil’s words, not yours, but whatever. That the stock is at a level that dividends are preferential, but I mean, I’m just not sure what…
Jeff Stoops: Those are Phil's words. Do you want – you have Phil's phone number, give him a call.
Walter Piecyk: Absolutely. All right, thanks.
Operator: And we'll go to Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Would you consider a one-time dividend to rejigger your leverage in between now and when your NOL run out or would you only pay a dividend if it was a start and a recurring one?
Brendan Cavanagh: I don't see the wisdom of a one-timer, Nick, but if I’m missing something, help us figure it out. But I don't see any benefit in that.
Nick Del Deo: No, that's totally fair. Going back to the issue of lands, how much higher do you think you can push it from the current 71% where does that top out and what's the split between land that you own or control under perpetual easement versus the long-term lease?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, we own roughly 30%, 35% of the land, either in the form of a long-term perpetual easement or outright ownership. In terms of it going higher the interesting thing about that, it can certainly continue to move higher and we have moved it higher over the years. But as you bring in some of the international stuff, sometimes it comes in with lower numbers, so it kind of resets it and that statistic is controlling for at least 20 years. So the funny thing is you always have those that are on the border of that every year that goes by it's a year less for some of those. So they, some of them fall below it. So you're constantly having to kind of extend your way out of it. So, that's a long way of saying it can go a little bit higher. But it's hard to move that number materially when you got 30,000 sites.
Nick Del Deo: Do you find purchase overseas to be interesting? I know in Brazil you typically have the pasture land dynamic that makes it less appealing.
Jeff Stoops: We do whether it's a purchase or an extension or an easement or some other type, of longer term entitlement. The concept still applies and we do find it interesting and beneficial. It's a little more difficult because the real estate laws are not nest and not in every case as a clear as they are in the U.S.
Nick Del Deo: Got It. Thanks guys.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Two questions, one was the kind of core domestic churn non-iDEN, non- Metro/Leap and Clear is about 1.3%. That's almost double over the last year. I know you talked about this a little bit Brendan I think last quarter, but it's up another 20 bps. And I wonder if you could kind of just speak to like where is this going, the shape of it, the drivers of it and does it kind of normalize at some point in time? And then the second question was if I'm reading it right, it looks like the, and I'm sorry to ask such a detailed question, but the guide appears to have like a $10 million improvement in other costs, which is helping kind of drive the income line at the margins, I was wondering if you can kind of just speak to that please. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the first one, which is the churn, it has increased a little bit. Some of that is non-big four related. We have certain customers that we've had churn-off. It's also a trailing 12-months number. My expectation is that it probably will be slightly higher later in the year, but I think it will probably come down then slightly thereafter. But our range as we've talked about historically is 1% to 1.5% for that kind of base churn. And I think, longer term that's the right range for that number. We're sort of right in the middle of it right now. On the second question, David. I'm afraid I'm a little bit, I'm not 100% sure which $10 million you're referring to. So sorry. I mean we're happy to get on the phone with you afterwards too. We can get, if there's a specific number we can, 
David Barden: It just went from 10 to 15 to 1 million to 6 million that was the question, but we can talk it offline. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Okay.
Operator: We’ll go to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Your line is open.
Spencer Kurn: Hey guys, thanks. So just wanted to follow-up on the question around organic growth domestically, accelerating for the rest of the year, as implied in your guidance. Could you just provide a little bit more color on the cadence. I know you've got, you posted really high growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 but it also sounds like you expected growth to increase every quarter throughout the year. So, any color you can provide on that would be really helpful.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean, I can't say exactly what the number will be each quarter obviously because there's certain uncertainties as you move through the year, but based on the backlog, what we've signed up to-date and what we expect to sign up, we make certain assumptions around timing. And most of the stuff that's been signed up, we already know the timing. So, we're pretty confident when we look out at what's scheduled to commence that will have an increase in those numbers as we move through the year. As you noted, the full year number that's on the bridge sort of suggests that the number at the end of the year or for the full year, I should say a 7.9%. So if we're at 7.5% here in the first quarter to get to close to 7.9% as an average, obviously it's got to, it's got to step up 20, 30 basis points each quarter roughly on average.
Jeff Stoops: On average, not necessarily each one.
Brendan Cavanagh: Right
Spencer Kurn: Right. Well that's sort of my question. Are you will – are we like thinking at the end of the year you’ll actually get at a higher rate than the average or is there some sort of a bell curve, overall like trend that we should expect.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I would expect we’ll be above the average, but at the end of the year.
Spencer Kurn: Awesome. And then just one quick follow-up if I may. FirstNet is over 50% done and the company is expecting to be, they expecting to be around 60% by the third quarter? Are you seeing a similar progress of work being done on your sites or is there sort of a lag, or any difference from your perspective of what you're seeing? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: No, that's hard to answer, Spencer, because not every amendment that comes out of AT&T is FirstNet, they're doing a variety of all kinds of different work involving all kinds of different pieces of their spectrum. And in some cases doing FirstNet work and then coming back and do another work. So, I mean that sounds about right. It could be a little bit less, I would doubt its setting more than that.
Spencer Kurn: Got It. Thanks so much.
Operator: We'll go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Brett Feldman: Two questions. The first one is pretty quick. The oil recovery you received in the quarter, was that factored into your original outlook or is that among the reasons why you increased your outlook for the year and then more just, and maybe I didn't hear it right, but I think you said 82% of your domestic leasing activity was big four. So, I guess that would mean 18% was non-big four, which seems like a big number. And I'm curious if that, if I heard it correctly was that predominantly DISH driven or is there a more interesting story in there?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, on the first one, the Oi recovery was not in our original outlook. So that was a part of the increase specifically to EBITDA and AFFO. It didn't affect the lines above that and the 82%, the biggest component of the non-big four piece was DISH.
Brett Feldman: Is there anything else in there of the non-DISH part that's ramping? I know you've gotten ask in the past about non-traditional or where is it sort of same eclectic mix you’ve normally had?
Jeff Stoops: Same eclectic mix and that story was the same as last quarter call.
Brett Feldman: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: We have a question from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Right, great thanks. Two if I may. When you think of the big four U.S. carriers, I think the view has been that the predominant amount of growth has been coming not just for SBA, but for the sector from both T-Mobile, as part of the 600 build out. And then also, AT&T with FirstNet and that Verizon has slowed it's pacing, although still material in terms of contributing to growth. And that Sprint really has for the most part gone away. I'm just curious if you agree with how I just characterized it. And then secondly, I guess more of a modeling question for Brendan. You raised your AFFO guidance by, what is it $0.07 on the low end and $0.03 on the high-end? I guess just what is it on the high-end that didn't allow you to take it up by the same amount? I thought I heard on the call you mentioned something about, the price of the stock being higher and that having an impact. And I'm just curious how we might try to think about that. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the second one, that's really more about taxes. It's just about where we range the taxes. The share count piece affects both ends of the range. The same because we're using the same number of shares as our assumption it just negatively impacted the overall number because we assumed a higher diluted share count. But it's really, we kind of moved our own thoughts about where our taxes will be more on the low end. So that's the only difference.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah. And on the activity levels. I mean there's activity from all big four Colby. So I don't think we agree with that description, particularly as it relates to spread. I'm not doing anything right now. I mean that's just not true. As it relates to us, on both the leasing and the services side.
Brett Feldman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And next we go to Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Niknam: Hey guys, thank you for taking the question. Brendan and I think, there was a mention of the guidance increase for this year being tied to more amendments relative to colo and maybe an earlier sort of commencement. Was that the entirety of the guidance increase or is there sort of a broader core increase underlying that beyond just sort of timing? And then just on the amendments, any color you can provide in terms of the pricing on these amendments. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the guidance, the leasing revenue increased the organic piece of it. And the best way to kind of look at it, Matt, is to look at the bridge that's in the supplemental package and you can look at the changes relative to last time that we provided it. You'll see that the lease up number went up about $3 million. Most of that was due to faster timing, which is due to a little bit heavier concentration of amendments. There were other reasons that our revenue guidance went up though those included some non-organic contributions as we've put some additional sites under contract that will help contribute and a couple of other minor changes. But those are the two biggest pieces.  I'm sorry, what was, what was the second one?
Matthew Niknam: Just in terms of pricing amendment.
Jeff Stoops: Amendment pricing continues to hold in very firmly. We're certainly not seeing any weakening there.
Matthew Niknam: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Great, thank you. Was the increase in discretionary CapEx all related to the acquisitions you have announced or are you finding more opportunities to build incremental sites and also as a carrier starts to gradually build some of their sites on their own. What do you think is driving that then? Can you lure some of that activity back to your portfolio?
Brendan Cavanagh: On the CapEx, it's basically all M&A related, there's a couple of minor little things, but it's not, there's really been no change in the overall expectations around new built for the year.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah. On the carrier building sites of on their own, we have seen that in some very limited circumstances. I think some of that is for sites that the carriers view as very strategic as opposed to capital driven because there's plenty of capital chasing that and I don't know about you. But we’ll ever be able to move that back given what we see as some very funny economic new build terms, which actually is the explanation why we just don't build as many towers in the U.S. as we used to.
Batya Levi: Okay. Fine.
Operator: And the question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Amy Yong: Thanks. I'm just wondering if you can update us on the customer activity in Brazil and with the spectrum auctions happening. I think in the back half of this year, 2020 we anticipate an increased activity or an acceleration in the region. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Well the customers are, be similar story to the U.S. they're all active but to varying degrees. And certainly with new spectrum, there will come new opportunities for us in the form certainly of amendments and hopefully new co-locations as well. So, we always welcome new spectrum. It's not millimeter wave spectrum, which of course has a much different use. This will be a macro tower oriented spectrum. So, we hope it goes through as planned and we would expect, certainly the benefit from that.
Amy Yong: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Robert Gutman with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Looking at sort of a bigger picture view, the drivers that are underlying the current acceleration in leasing activity? How far out do you think these carry, in terms of not only for next year's guidance, but, does the current strong pace of activity sort of dry it out looking at next year? There's a reason to believe that it's still early in terms of where the carriers are in terms of what they're doing.
Jeff Stoops: Well, it seems early in the sense that there's, there's still a lot to do in terms of building out the 4G and then if you believe the pondents and the technicians for everyone to have a truly a vibrant 5G product, they're all going to need to deploy some kind of massive MiMo architecture and that hasn't even really started yet. So, I think we've got a long way to go.
Robert Gutman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Well, we have no additional questions at this time, so please continue.
Jeff Stoops: I want to thank everyone for listening in to our call and we look forward to our next one when we release the second quarter results. Thank you.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-21 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today’s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to our host Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, everyone and thank you for joining us for SBA’s fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2018 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detailed material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 21, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good evening. We had a tremendous fourth quarter with very strong results across all areas of our business, including very positive operating and financial results in both our leasing and services businesses. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $444.7 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $441.8 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our estimates for the fourth quarter, which we previously provided with our third quarter earnings release, only modestly impacting our results in comparison to our 2018 outlook that we provided last quarter. They were much more of a headwind on year-ago comparisons, but we still did very well. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 6% over the fourth quarter of 2017, including the impact of 2.1% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 8.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 7.4% on a gross basis, and 5.1% on a net basis, including 2.3% of churn, over half of which was related to Metro/Leap, Clearwire and iDEN termination. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth on a gross basis increased to its highest point in over two years, reflecting our strong 2018 operational domestic leasing activity. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue signed up during the quarter, was very strong in the fourth quarter and once again well above the year-ago levels. During the fourth quarter, we again had solid but varied contributions from each of the Big Four carriers. Newly signed up domestic leasing revenue came about 53% from amendments and 47% from new leases, and the big four carriers represented 84% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. We also had a nice contribution to our domestic operational leasing activity from Dish. We exited the year with a solid domestic backlog, which we expect to provide us with a continued healthy level of new lease and amendment signings as we move into 2019, and earlier activity has been consistent with that. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 10.3%, including 1% of churn or 11.3% on a gross basis. International churn consisted almost entirely of one non-big four customer in Brazil and one minor tenant in Nicaragua. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 12.7% on a constant currency basis, resulting from strong operational leasing activity in Brazil over the last 12 months. Across our international markets, as a whole, we had another strong leasing quarter, with Brazil again providing the biggest contribution. In Brazil, we had solid contributions from Claro, Vivo, Oi and TIM. During the fourth quarter, 86.3% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.1% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 8.8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. With regard to fourth quarter churn, we continue to see churn from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire consistent with our expectations. As of year-end, we have approximately $11 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next two years. Also, in the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $6 million of annualized churn from certain legacy iDEN-related leases. Because the iDEN churn occurred late in the year, it will have a greater impact on our 2019 results than our 2018 results. The formal exploration of these leases had been anticipated within our full year 2018 outlook, and it is incorporated into our full year 2019 outlook. Domestic churn in the fourth quarter from all other tenants on an annual same-tower basis was 1.1%, most of which relates to narrowband technologies and vestiges of individually immaterial carrier consolidation. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $354.1 million. Our industry-leading domestic tower cash flow margin increased to 82.9% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin increased to 68.8% and was 89.5%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $339.3 million. Our adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were again driven by strong performances in both our leasing and services businesses. Services revenues in the fourth quarter were $39.1 million, up 34.9% over the fourth quarter of 2017, driving over twice as much services gross profit as the year-ago period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.5% in the quarter compared to 70.6% in the year-earlier period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.1%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. AFFO in the fourth quarter was $229.9 million. AFFO per share was $2, an increase of 12.4% over the fourth quarter of 2017 or 15.2% on a constant currency basis. During the fourth quarter, we continue to invest in expanding our tower portfolio, acquiring 79 communication sites for $28.5 million and building 169 sites. Most of the added sites were located internationally. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have acquired 27 additional communication sites for $10.7 million. And as of today, we have 264 total additional sites under contract for acquisition at an aggregate price of $78.1 million. We also continued to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $21.5 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the year, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Beyond portfolio investments, we also invested in significant share repurchases during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we spent $342 million to repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of $158.09 per share. Our total 2018 share repurchases were $795.5 million shares or five million shares, representing an average price of $159.87 per share. Share repurchases remain an important contributor to our efforts to continually grow AFFO per share. Looking ahead now, our earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2019. Our outlook reflects another year of solid growth in our leasing business. Our anticipated outlook for 2019 leasing revenue is built upon a strong operational leasing activity we saw throughout 2018, but particularly in the second half of the year. We also anticipate continued healthy levels of domestic operational leasing activity in 2019, based largely on current application backlogs. We have also assumed an increase in year-over-year domestic churn levels, driven partially by the full year impact of the fourth quarter 2018 iDEN churn I mentioned earlier as well as an assumed return to our historical range of normal churn of between 1% and 1.5%. With regards to the potential Sprint/T-Mobile merger, we do not have any specific knowledge regarding the likelihood of the merger receiving regulatory approval.  However, we have assumed, for purposes of our 2019 services guidance, that the transaction does get approved, and we see a stop to all activity with Sprint starting this summer. We would not anticipate the outcome of the merger approval process to meaningfully impact our 2019 leasing outlook. In our international business, our outlook anticipates continued steady organic leasing contributions. We have incorporated consensus estimates of a slight weakening in the Brazilian foreign exchange rate from where we are today, assuming a consistent FX rate during 2019 of R$3.80 to US$1. Effective January 1, 2019, SBA will be adopting the new lease accounting standard. This accounting standard requires lessees to now recognize a lease liability and offsetting right-of-use assets on their balance sheet. As a result, beginning in 2019, we anticipate recording a new lease liability on our balance sheet of approximately $2.5 billion related to our existing ground lease obligations. There will be a corresponding right-of-use asset recorded on our balance sheet as well. We do not expect this new accounting to have any material impact on our income statement, our reported adjusted EBITDA, our AFFO, our liquidity, our ratings or our debt covenant compliance. However, the adoption of this new standard will require a change in the treatment of tenant lease origination costs, which will result in a reduction to cost of site leasing revenue and an increase to selling, general and administrative expense. As such, our reported tower cash flow as well as our reported SG&A will each be higher in 2019 than they would have been without the impact of the new standard by about $9 million. The impact of this change has been incorporated into our 2019 full year outlook for tower cash flow. Our full year 2019 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today, and it does not assume any share repurchases at all. We’ve assumed one new financing during the third quarter of 2019 at an interest rate of 4.25% to refinance our maturing 2014-1C securitization notes. For our floating rate debt, we have assumed a one-month LIBOR rate of 2.60% throughout the year, as well as including the impact of our recently entered into interest rate swap, which Mark will discuss further in a moment. We estimate an increase in our cash taxes of approximately $4 million to $5 million at the midpoint, mostly related to state taxes where we do not have any NOLs and increases in international taxes. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of 114.4 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We are excited and optimistic about 2019, and we see great opportunities for SBA throughout the year ahead. I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the year with $9.9 billion of net debt, and our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3x, within our targeted range of 7x to 7.5x. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.5x. The weighted average coupon on our outstanding debt is 3.9% and our weighted average maturity is approximately 4.3 years. As of today, we have $205 million outstanding under our $1.25 billion committed revolver. On February 1, 2019, we entered into a four-year $1.2 billion interest rate swap, effectively fixing the interest expense at 4.495% on approximately half of our outstanding 2018 Term Loan B. This rate is essentially flat with the rate we are paying under our term loan today. The unhedged portion of our Term Loan B will continue to accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 200 basis points. Pro forma for this transaction, approximately 88% of our non-revolver debt outstanding is fixed, which will reduce the impact of future interest rate fluctuations and create greater certainty in our future AFFO. With regard to stock repurchases, as Brendan mentioned earlier, during the fourth quarter, we spent $342 million to repurchase 2.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $158.09 per share. All of the shares purchased were retired. As of today, we have $204.5 million of authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at December 31, 2018 are 112.4 million, down 3.4% from 116.4 million at December 31, 2017. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. The fourth quarter was a particularly strong one for SBA. We exceeded our expectations across all financial metrics. We continue to see robust operational leasing activity in our services business at one of its strongest quarters in years. Importantly, we ended the year with a very healthy backlog of leasing applications, setting us up for a nice start to 2019. Operationally, we continue to perform at a high level of efficiency, managing our costs and growing our margins. In the fourth quarter, we once again produced industry-leading operating margins, demonstrating the high quality of our assets and the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations. Our tower cash flow margin was 80.2% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.5%. Our domestic tower cash flow margin hit an all-time high of 82.9% this quarter. We will continue our focus on being an industry leader in this area. In the U.S., the strong operational leasing activity we saw throughout 2018 has left us well positioned for good financial results in 2019. All four major U.S. wireless carriers were active during the year, with each of them continuing to invest in their networks, deploying new and incremental equipment in order to address the continual growth in wireless data consumption. Contributions continue to come from new spectrum deployments, the rollout of FirstNet, new coverage and capacity build-outs and early-stage activities as a precursor to 5G. In the fourth quarter, we also began to execute leases with DISH, which activity has continued into 2019. Internationally, we had another strong leasing quarter with organic leasing activity exceeding our internal expectations in most of our markets. The contractual revenue signed up during this quarter in our international markets came about 43% from new leases and 57% from amendments. We had another very positive quarter in Brazil with solid contributions from all major wireless carriers there. The Brazilian economy appears to continue to be improving, and we have seen the exchange rates stabilized since last quarter's presidential election. There are legislative and regulatory movements afoot that we believe will improve the structure of the wireless industry around spectrum caps and concessions. There remains a lot of 700-megahertz spectrum from prior TVs yet to be deployed and potentially additional new 700-megahertz spectrum to be auctioned in the near future. Consequently, we're optimistic about the prospects for 2019 in Brazil. During the fourth quarter, we also continued to allocate capital into quality new assets and accretive share repurchases. We grew our tower portfolio by 6% in 2018, within our targeted range of 5% to 10% annual portfolio growth. We are targeting this range again during 2019 through disciplined builds and acquisitions. Our primary focus for portfolio growth will remain the western hemisphere, but we also continued to be open to and regularly explore opportunities in other markets. The marketplace for new tower assets does continue to be very competitive, domestically and internationally. As a result, we stayed within our target capitalization by opportunistically purchasing 2.2 million shares of our stock during the fourth quarter at very attractive prices. While our bias will remain toward portfolio growth, we will continue to look for opportunities to repurchase our stock when we believe it is undervalued. Speaking of valuation, there is a very interesting dynamic that is occurring in our space, which is the rise of the institutional infrastructure investor. Different than the traditional telecom investor, these investors are attracted to the core attributes that have been the hallmark of our industry, long-term, predictable, growing cash flows. These infrastructure funds have huge pools of capital to invest and are funded by pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds. These funds value assets over much longer periods of time than our historical investors. In the last 12 months, these funds have outbid strategic investors for a number of communications assets around the globe, and that's the first. Now why is that important? Because I know that the assets being purchased by these funds at much higher multiples are nearly of the same quality as ours. And with our unparalleled margin and operating performance, this shows us that we have a clear opportunity for much greater value creation. These infrastructure funds, much like the traditional REIT investor, are very smart. They've seen this dynamic, and as a result, we are seeing them increasing their interest and positioning our shareholder base, and we welcome that. We had a tremendous 2018 and expect to have a great 2019 as well. We’re an excellent business had a great time in history for building out 4G networks in the beginning of the development of 5G, which we believe will provide us with multiple years of solid customer demand and strong growth. With those demand drivers, our quality assets, excellent operating performance and our strong capital structure, we think we are well positioned to continue to drive growth and shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for great 2018 and their contributions to our success. And with that, Gary, we're going to open it up for questions.
Operator: All right, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we now go to line of Jon Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sir, your line is open.
Jon Atkin: Thanks very much. So, a couple of questions. One, I wondered if the U.S. wireless industry were to see major consolidation, if you can kind of update us on your thoughts and philosophy around MLAs, holistic MLAs. And then secondly, I wondered if you can maybe talk a little bit about DAS and small cells. Your website actually mentions a number of very interesting use cases in healthcare, hospitality, retail. And to the extent that you get further involved in those activities, is that the services line item? Or is that rental revenue – source of rental revenues for you going forward as you kind of see that developing? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Hey, John, it's Jeff. We are open and willing and have in the past entered into MLAs. It's entirely term and transaction specific. And we have no issues with entering into one and have in fact as you know entered into MLAs in the past with both T-Mobile and Sprint. And in terms of the small cells and DAS, we have a growing line of business here, which we call our exclusive asset or exclusive real estate business where we focused on unique and underlying pieces of real estate that we think have very unique attributes and we are developing alternate to macro uses in these facilities, whether it be DAS or small cells or in the future we're focused on CBRS potentials. And those will most certainly be in our site lease and are today – a little bit immaterial today. And as they grow, they will be in the site leasing line of our income statement. We have some actual pretty neat facilities today. Again, they're immaterial, but we have some hospital chains. We actually manage and own the DAS system inside the Macy's Herald Square building.
Jon Atkin: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And now to the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I'm not sure how much details you can share with respect to customer-specific activity, but you called out DISH, I figured it's fair game to ask. Can you expand at all on what you're seeing from them? What sort of work they are doing? And how durable you think that leasing contribution might be in future periods?
Jeff Stoops: Well, they're very active. They're signing leases. They have a strong backlog of applications. They are – from all intents and purposes based on what we can tell, they are firmly committed to a very active 2019.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. It's good to hear. And then looking at your domestic and leasing guidance for 2019, looks like it's about equal to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 annualized. So, should we basically expect the 2019 leasing volumes will be relative flat over the course of the year? Or will there some sort of cadence to it that we should bear in mind?
Brendan Cavanagh: Hey, Nick, it's Brendan. It is similar to what the fourth quarter contribution is, but again, it is driven by activity. As we talked about in the past, you have leasing activity that when you sign stuff up and there is some delay in the timing on when it kind of kicks in. So a decent percentage of our guidance is obviously based on stuff that we already know, what's already been signed up in the second half of the year. So I'm pretty confident that we'll see similar levels to the end of the year as we get to the first half of the year, maybe even slightly higher. It's hard to say for sure whether the cadence changes at all in the back half of the year, but I would expect it to be a little bit flatter than it was during 2018.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Understood. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And now to the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you. Just to follow-up on your churn commentary. Can you quantify how much more churn we should expect from iDEN and maybe the pacing of the $11 million left from Metro, Leap and Clearwire? And the normal churn I think you guided to 1% to 1.5%. Is there any reason why it should be at the higher end? One other question I had was mostly related to your comments on interest from infrastructure fund. Given that do you find valuations are increasing as you look at new portfolio acquisition opportunities internationally and in the U.S.?
Brendan Cavanagh: Hi, Batya. On the churn questions, Metro, Leap and Clearwire as we said has about $11 million of annualized churn, but we have not yet received any notification. In pacing, I would expect it's going to take place over the next two years. Hard to say what the exact time it will be but based on our expectations, we'll see it fairly evenly over that time period, maybe a little bit heavier in 2019, but it's not that noticeable. On the iDEN side, we had some leftover iDEN leases from the TowerCo deal that expired October 1, 2018. So the vast majority of the iDEN impact has already taken place. But in our year – from a year-over-year standpoint, you see most of that impact in 2019, because it happened later in the year. And on the other churn, it's hard to say whether it will be at the high end or the middle of that range or the low end of it, as some of our assumptions or estimates we're making around churn has not actually been realized yet. We haven't received any notifications. But if anything, it's really just a timing issue when we receive a particular notice, when there's a particular firm end date, that kind of thing. So it's possible that it would be toward the high-end of the 1% to 1.5%, but it's just as easily be toward the lower half.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, on the infrastructure question, Batya, I think the fact that they've emerged and have been seeing in processes and been the winner in those processes which really hadn't seen really heretofore shows that they are a factor in valuation. And I think that's really a function of the time horizon that they apply to their decision-making and also, of course, the return requirements that they're underwriting to. And really my comments are – they're pretty straightforward. There's a whole new asset class out there of investor that is looking at things that is finding value at multiples or assets that I know are nearly as good SBA's at much higher values and we certainly take a lot of optimism from things like that.
Batya Levi: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And now to line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Jeff Stoops: Hi.
Ric Prentiss: Hey. I want to follow-up from Batya's question a little bit. So, is there anything you've seen on the historical churn that would cause you to think it should go up to the 1% to 1.5% since you've been kind of running in the sub-1% sort of quite a while?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, there's not anything that I would point to as being a specific item. We saw – we had some legacy leases with one particular carrier, where they actually were never on air. And so we saw some notifications I think where they have decided to clean up some of that or maybe they made a poor decision five years ago. So the timing of that may cause it to be a little bit higher. A lot of the churn that we're seeing, I'm talking about domestically obviously – specifically, is related to narrowband tenants. So the timing of when those guys are going to close up shop or cancel leases, it's a little hard for us to peg down, but it can happen in waves. So, that's all I can really say about it is that it's a matter of timing and a specific customer can kind of ship things one way or the other.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. That helps. And then Jeff, you shared a little bit on Jonathan's question about small cell/DAS. Hospital chains and Macy's Herald Square building sounds more like indoor. Are you looking at outdoor? Are you looking at fiber solutions? Or is it really the exclusive real estate business is kind of more like an indoor system? Just trying to get a little more color.
Jeff Stoops: It's mostly indoor but it will be outdoor when it can meet the exclusive attributes we're looking for. But you should assume that that would be kind of limited in its application.
Ric Prentiss: So, maybe more campus situations?
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. And the final question is on – and Batya has also pointed about the institutional infrastructure investor. We've obviously been watching, AFFO has become a primary measure of valuation in the tower world, but it seems like the prepaid rent item can kind of skew things. Now how do you guys view looking at AFFO or prepaid rent? And when you see the infra funds come in, what are they looking at do you think?
Jeff Stoops: Well, I think they're looking at AFFO, but they're also looking at true cash – true cash generation. And so I think they're probably looking at that and basically the real cash that's there for distribution, which is the way we've always run the business.
Ric Prentiss: Cash on cash. Okay. Very good. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And now to the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. One moment, please. Sorry, I have a little computer issue here, one moment please. Computer is frozen one moment please. Sorry for the delay, we did have a technical issue here. [Operator Instructions] And we go to the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Hi, can you hear me now?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, we can.
Michael Rollins: That's good. You're hired. So, two questions. Thank you for patiently waiting for my questions. First, if you can just talk about the new activity that you're guiding to for both the domestic and the international operations for 2019? If you kind of think of the visibility that you have now going into 2019, how would you rate that relative to a year ago? Trying to reverse the thought and you're thinking about the visibility going into 2018. And then the second question I had just on the topic of the infrastructure funds, would there be an interest to just maybe even a portion of your portfolio and just raise money at the tower level not dissimilar to some of the ways that you securitize towers in the past and think about that as a funding mechanism for your business?
Jeff Stoops: Well, I'll start with the second one first. I'm not sure that we're not doing that through the securitization. So, if we ever did need equity financing, I have no doubt that that type of thing would be available. But as you know, we've been equity reducers and not equity expanders. But I have no doubt that should we find something that would cause us to want to issue equity for an opportunity that that source would be there. In terms of the visibility, we do have much greater visibility frankly because a lot of the projects that are under way today hadn't really started this time last year. And basically everything that's going on now as the calendar turned, you'd have the typical beginning-of-the-year hesitation or pause that's so very typical with our customers. So we did have greater visibility, but you still have the same limited duration of visibility, which lasts about six months. So we hit the ground running in January 1, but we still can only see about six months out. But in terms of seeing the activity levels, they're just much greater than they were at this time a year ago.
Michael Rollins: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And now to the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good evening. I wonder if you could just update us on the NOL status and the dividend timing and how you plan to kind of take the leverage down. And then any comments on pricing trends and competitive build activity as we go into 2019? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Simon, on the NOLs, our current federal NOLs as of the end of the year for the REIT structure are about $755 million. We do have additional NOLs, just as a side note of little over $100 million for our TRS entities. Our expected timing is similar to what it's been in the past in terms of running through those NOLs, which would be mid-2021. As of right now, our intention is to continue to use those NOLs for paying the dividend.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And there's nothing out in the market, Simon, that has impacted our pricing decisions. They've been fairly consistent for years now.
Simon Flannery: Great. And are you seeing any change in the volume of competitive build, activity build-to-suit? Seems like there's a lot of press releases but what are you seeing on the ground?
Jeff Stoops: Nothing that's material or – no, it would be the answer to your question.
Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And now to the line of Spencer Kurn from New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn: Hey, guys. Thanks. So you talked a little bit about your backlog. But I just wonder if you can just provide a little bit more color on how it's been trending in the back half of 2018 and even today. Is it still rising? Or have you sort of reached your cruising altitude which should carry you through the year?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I would say more cruising altitude type, Spencer, maybe with slight variations, but we've reached good strong levels of operational conversion of that backlog but it continues to replenish itself.
Spencer Kurn: Got it. Thanks. And then just one follow-up, it looks like you've guided to lower non-organic revenue in 2019. Could you just comment on what you're seeing in the M&A landscape? And if you're seeing it improve, are there more deals coming in 2019 versus last year? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, remember, we only guide to what we have signed up. So it's purely a function of what's under contract. So you should never think that that's a reflection of what the market may bring our way. And there's – there will be the same I think level of opportunities out there that will give us a chance to spend a lot more capital if we see the right deals. But what we have in there is just a function of what's signed up today and I do think there'll be a lot of other things to look at. Now whether we find them acceptable and good returns on where we want to spend our money or not is yet to be seen.
Spencer Kurn: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And now to the line of Walter Piecyk from BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Jeffrey, are you happy with the – with about $13 million of new leasing activity you booked in the fourth quarter? Was there anything left on the table from an execution standpoint?
Jeff Stoops: Was there anything left on the table? We could always – I'm never happy, Walter. I always want more. But yes, I thought we did OK. I mean the way things happen in reality is there's a lot of things that looks like it's going to get signed up but then for one reason or another it slips. But that's life.
Brendan Cavanagh: I mean the other thing about that Walter is that that $13 million of growth that you're referring to is the revenue growth into the quarter. A lot of that was kind of rebate based on the stuff that was signed before. I mean really we're just going is what did we sign up during the quarter and do we sign up as much as we would like to? And obviously we always like to sign up more, which would benefit us in the future quarters.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. The stuff I'm talking about hasn't hit the financials yet.
Walter Piecyk: All right. So, Verizon talked about I guess if they got a new spectrum as opposed to the small cell strategy throughout three to six months of putting into the network. So, presumably when you're looking at your annual guidance, I think about four or five months left as part of the new signings to drop additional new leasing activity. Is that sound about right?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, that's about right.
Walter Piecyk: My second question, I guess maybe third, but first had had two parts. The second question is there's been a laundry list of potential buyers for Zayo. I'm surprised you guys haven't appeared on the list. Can you just give us your latest thinking on fiber and whether you would have any interest in acquiring Zayo?
Jeff Stoops: Well, we don't really want to comment that specifically. But in general, our theory which kind of goes through the comments that I made to John Atkins and Ric Prentiss is we're looking to expand the things that we do but in areas that we call exclusive real estate that will have some barriers to entry and our ability to control our destiny going forward. So, I'll leave it up to you to decide how interested we would be in that asset.
Walter Piecyk: Historically, that's been not very interesting, but it seems like they're on the block. And if they're willing to sell it, $30 or $35 a share, is that a compelling-enough evaluation for that type of business?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I can't comment on that.
Walter Piecyk: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And now to the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: All right, great. My questions are bit more boring. So the first one is on AT&T and FirstNet, can you give us a sense of how far long you think they are in that process and that's still building or do you think we've already, I guess, reached the tipping point there? And then secondly, as it relates to T-Mobile and Sprint, I know that was asked the first question by Atkin, but yes, it's specific to an MLA. But can you remind us, I mean, it seems like that deal is more likely now than not to occur. Do you think that that when they actually start to get everything together and start to tighten up the network, would you anticipate that having a material impact on growth rates not just for SBA but for the sector and really the question is just a matter of timing? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. On the FirstNet then called the I – I mean they're pretty busy and it's hard for me to judge exactly where they are in the process, but I still think there's a long way to go. I think activity goes well into 2020 there. And on the – we continue to believe that if T-Mobile were approved to acquire Sprint that initially the activity levels would revolve around T-Mobile leading to bring on equipment to allow the migration of the Sprint subscribers over to the T-Mobile network. So you're going to have some positive amendments for the industry before you have any kind of decline through for decommissionings and that should be a multi-year period. And we continue to think that that's how it goes.
Colby Synesael: To that point on the MLA that was asked earlier, I mean, if they were willing to give you something like we're going to be putting all those 2.5 on our towers rather than pay us charges for all that, we'll promise you less churn I guess years out. Is that conceptually something you would consider?
Jeff Stoops: I mean, at the broadest level, we would agree to any MLA that makes good sense for both parties. We have no religious or political objections to MLAs.
Colby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have no one else in queue. Please continue.
Jeff Stoops: Thank you, everyone for joining us. We look forward to continue reporting as we move through 2019.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-11-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the meeting over our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Laurie. Good evening, everyone and thank you for joining us for SBA’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we’ll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2018 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detailed material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, November 5, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had a great third quarter with very positive operating results in both our leasing and services businesses. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $435.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $430.2 million. Foreign exchange rates were weaker than our estimates for the third quarter which we previously provided with our second quarter earnings release, negatively impacting leasing revenue by $1.7 million. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 5.9% over the third quarter of 2017, including the impact of 1.8% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 7.7%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 7% on a gross basis and 5% on a net basis including 2% of churn. Approximately half of which was related to Metro, Leap and Clearwire terminations. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth on a gross basis increased sequentially for the second quarter in a row, and we expect it to increase again next quarter based on a strong year-to-date operational, domestic leasing activity we have experienced. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 10.4%, including 80 basis points of churn or 11.2% on a gross basis. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 12.9% on a constant currency basis, a solid increase over the second quarter reflecting increased operational leasing activity in Brazil over the last 12 months. Domestic operational leasing activity representing new revenue signed up during the quarter was very strong in the third quarter up from second quarter levels and for the third quarter in a row, well above year-ago levels. During the third quarter, we again had solid contributions from each of the big four carriers. Newly signed up domestic leasing revenue came above 60% from amendments and 40% from new leases. And the big four carriers represented 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter. WE have solid backlogs with each of our major U.S. customers and we expect them to remain active, investing in their networks, resulting in a continued healthy level of new lease and amendment signings in the fourth quarter. Internationally, we had another strong leasing quarter with Brazil providing the biggest contribution. In Brazil, we had solid contributions from Claro, Vivo, and TIM. During the third quarter, 86.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil with Brazil representing 11.6% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.3% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. With regard to third quarter churn, we continue to see churn from leases with Metro, Leap, and Clearwire consistent with our expectations. As of September 30, we have approximately $13 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with Metro lease and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next two years. Domestic churn in the third quarter from all other tenants on an annual same-tower basis was 1.1%. And of that, less than 30 basis points was related to the big four tenants. We anticipate slightly higher churn in the fourth quarter due to the non-renewal of certain legacy iDEN related leases, the impact of which has been and continues to be included in our full year 2018 outlook. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $344.8 million. Our industry-leading domestic tower cash flow margin increased to 82.8% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was a very strong 68.6% and 89.5% excluding the impact of pass through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $328.1 million. Our adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were again driven by strong performances in both our leasing and services businesses. Services revenues in the third quarter were $32 million, up 25.8% over the third quarter of 2017 driving an increase of over 75% in services gross profit over the year ago period. Cash SG&A for the quarter was in line with expectations and continues to remain very low as a percentage of total revenue. Our industry leading adjusted EBITDA margin was 71% in the quarter compared to 70.6% in the year earlier period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.6%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA it was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. AFFO in the third quarter was $222.7 million. AFFO per share was a $1.92, an increase of 9.7% over the third quarter of 2017 or 13.1% on a constant currency basis. AFFO was negatively impacted by $1 million or $0.01 per share due to weaker foreign exchange rates in the quarter than we had forecasted for our prior outlook which was given July 30. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in expanding our tower portfolio, deploying incremental capital into both new tower builds and acquisitions. During the third quarter, we acquired 679 communications sites for $106.9 million with most of those sites located internationally. We also built 90 sites during the third quarter. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have acquired 46 additional communication sites for $17.1 million. And as of today, we have 410 total additional sites under contract for acquisition and an aggregate price of $97.9 million. We also continue to invest in the land under our sites which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $14.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is approximately 35 years. Our across the board strong third quarter results have allowed us to increase the midpoint of our full-year 2018 outlook in almost every category. We increased at the midpoints our full-year leasing revenue and tower cash flow outlook by $6 million, adjusted EBITDA by $11 million, AFFO by $9.5 million and AFFO per share by $0.115. Consistent with our historical practice, our updated full-year 2018 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those closed or under contract today and it does not assume any additional debt financing or share repurchases beyond those completed prior to today. We have however increased the midpoint of our full-year outlook for net cash interest expense by $3 million primarily to account for increased borrowings under our revolver which was used to fund share repurchases during the third and fourth quarters. I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the third quarter with $9.7 billion of net debt and our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.4 times within our targeted range of 7 to 7.5 times. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.5 times. The weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.9% and the weighted average maturity is approximately 4.5 years. We continue to believe that we manage our balance sheet very effectively and we are pleased to see the recent upgrade of our corporate credit rating by S&P to BB. During the third quarter, we borrowed under our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility in order to fund share repurchases. And as of today, we have $215 million outstanding under the revolver. During the third quarter, we spent $180 million under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan to repurchase 696,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $155.16. Subsequent to September 30, we repurchased 937,000 shares for $142 million or $151.55 per share. All the shares repurchase were retired. As of today, we have $404.5 million of authorization remaining under the repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at the end of September 30, 2018 a $114.2 million down from $118.4 million at September 30, 2017 which is a 3.5% reduction. With that I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening everyone. We had another very solid quarter with financial results that exceeded our expectations and showed continued strength in operational leasing activity. Our positive third quarter results and expectations of a strong fourth quarter have allowed us to increase our full year 2018 financial outlook in all of our key metrics. In the U.S., new business signed up continued to be healthy, increasing from Q2 levels. This activity came primarily from the big four carriers, with all of them contributing to our results. Our leasing and services backlogs remain high, giving us comfort and a strong finish to the year. Domestic wireless data consumption continues to climb, including heavy bandwidth usage applications like mobile video streaming. In order to meet the constantly growing needs of their networks, our customers continue to deploy more spectrum and advanced technologies at our sites. In addition, contributions continue to come from the rollout of FirstNet and the early stage activities being done ahead of 5G, including the deployment of MIMO antennas in the 600 megahertz and 2.5 gigahertz spectrum bands. We're working really hard for our customers in both leasing and services. Doing whatever it takes to get the job done on time and on budget. We're happy to do it to meet our customers’ needs as they're very busy, busier than they have been in years and we are here to meet those needs. Internationally, we also had another very strong leasing quarter with Brazil once again leading the charge. In Brazil we had one of our biggest quarters in years in terms of new business signed up with solid contributions from all four major wireless carriers. We also had another nice jump in organic same-tower revenue growth in Brazil on a constant currency basis, reflecting the positive leasing trends in that market over the last 12 months. The contractual revenues signed up during this quarter in our international markets came about 53% from new leases and 47% from amendments, which is similar to the mix we would expect going forward. During the third quarter, we once again saw a sizable decline in the Brazilian real which negatively affected our reported results. However, with some of the uncertainties related to the recently completed Brazilian elections now behind us. We've seen the exchange rate subsequent to quarter-end improve and stabilize somewhat. President Bolsonaro is the first president elected in Brazil outside of the Workers Party during our period of investment and he ran on a platform of debt reduction and fiscal and economic reform. We are optimistic as to the future under his leadership. Regardless of some of the noise created by the volatile movements in FX rates, we’re extremely pleased with the performance of our Brazilian operations. Not only have we seen continued strengthening in the organic growth trends. We've seen a clear acceptance and a sense of normalcy adopted around the basic operations of the tower industry by regulatory authorities, land owners and our customers in Brazil. And as we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, the underlying Brazilian economy seems to continue to be improving which is supportive of continued growth opportunities for both us and our customers. During the third quarter, we also continued to add to our international portfolio acquiring 663 towers and several transactions including 463 towers in El Salvador as part of our acquisition of sites there from Millicom International and 179 towers acquired in Ecuador. We also built 83 towers in our international markets during quarter. We expect to continue to add sites that are existing markets through disciplined builds and acquisitions. Our primary focus for portfolio expansion remains the Western Hemisphere but we also continue to be open to and regularly explore opportunities in other markets. Our tower additions year-to-date across our entire tower portfolio have ensured we will once again grow our portfolio by 5% to 10% in 2018. Ahead of our dividend obligations which we currently estimate to start in 2021, we continue to target 7 to 7.5 times net debt leverage notwithstanding the recent increase in interest rate. Our bias has always been and remains today toward portfolio growth. However, we are always willing to repurchase our stock when we believe it is undervalued particularly in times like now, where we are seeing such strong organic growth. Our balance sheet management and focus on quality portfolio growth and opportunistic share repurchases has been a key component of our value creation throughout our history. In addition to tower portfolio growth, we are excited about our prospects and some of our recent success associated with investments we are making in other strategic real estate. These efforts are built around securing exclusive wireless rights to world-class venues. Some of the solutions we are able to provide to these venues include rooftop and exterior wireless management, small cell solutions and in-building wireless networks including DAS WiFi and CBRS solutions. While we are in the early stages of some of these initiatives, we believe the quality of the real estate we are accumulating will drive extremely attractive returns on our investments. In addition, we continue to work on initial prototype mobile edge computing locations built around our existing property locations. It’s still very early in the development of these solutions. But we believe we have a distinct advantage with the quality locations we are targeting and we are excited about the potential for this additional business line down the road. Operationally, we continue to perform at a high-level of efficiency, managing our costs and growing our margins. In the third quarter, we once again produced industry-leading operating margins demonstrating the quality of our assets and effectiveness of operations. Our tower cash flow margin was 80.2% and are our adjusted EBITDA margin was 71.0% both up from the third quarter of last year as well as sequentially over the second quarter of this year. This will continue to be an area of focus for us as it always has been. We're in a great time in this industry. We've had a tremendous 2018 so far and we are optimistic about the end of the year and our prospects for 2019. We intend to use our strong cash flows and access to attractive financing to make disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation decisions. These investments along with the strength of our current customer demand and our operational excellence will allow us to drive growth and shareholder value through growth and AFFO per share. I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their contributions to our success. And Laurie, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to go into the organic growth rate increase on the domestic side from 6.4% to 7.0% despite churn kind of ticking up, can you give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing there and how it should invoice?
Jeff Stoops: It's not despite churn, it's before churn. But it's just more activity. I mean as we have been telegraphing all year, we expected to see a pickup in those rates and remember those are trailing 12 months rates. So it's also a function of the year-ago periods not being as strong. So the comparison to the year-ago periods are in fact helping this. So, one way to look at it is we've had successive periods that were stronger than the year-ago period. Third quarter just completed much stronger than the year-ago period which dropped off stronger than the fourth quarter of last year. So you've seen just successive increases in those periods of new revenue added. But don't confuse the churn as a, we exclude the churn from the gross numbers and you can see that in the supplemental materials.
Unidentified Analyst: I guess what I was trying to get to on is, are you seeing an increase in activity? Or is this more of…
Jeff Stoops: By definition we have to be seeing more revenue added per tower for those growth rates to be increasing. So yes.
Operator: Our next question from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: A couple of questions. First we noted that there was a change in your 2019 straight line adjustment in the supplement - appreciate the supplement. You guys don't do a lot of analyze, but how should we think about that? Looks like maybe it was the delta was maybe $5 million to $6 million. Have you done an MLA and is that an indicator of some new business coming in 2019?
Jeff Stoops: Well Ric we had done an agreement with Sprint last year which last year, incorporated the potential for term extensions as amendments were done plus the agreements that are signed as new leases have longer term. So when we give you those 2019 numbers, it's really just to give you a guide but it's at a moment in time and so a quarter ago and when we gave it to you, it's whatever's in the system at that time but as we sign up additional amendments that extend terms or leases with longer terms, it affects that. So those numbers are going to move around a little bit. I'm sure they're going to be a little different again next quarter too. But that's one of the primary drivers.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. I think I noticed that Sprint now are about 19.5% of your domestic revenue, what was the remaining life down on those leases and also maybe update what the T-Mobile average life is?
Jeff Stoops: Well, specifically on the overlap sites, Sprint is about five years on average remaining and T-Mobile's about three years left which is not that different than the portfolio at large.
Ric Prentiss: And then last question, Jeff, you talked a little bit about the stock buyback pacing. How should we think about as you guys look at the potential for M&A out there and versus obviously a volatile market? And when do you need to readout, I think your down, Mark was saying you were down to about $405 million left on the authorized program. So how should we think about the pacing of the buyback versus portfolio and also when you might re-up the program?
Jeff Stoops: Well as has been always the case, we would like to spend all the money on high quality portfolio growth that meets our investment goals. If we can't do that, then we turn our attention towards staying fully invested through stock repurchases. So it’s really hard to say some quarters will be more than others and we have the ability through a very decisive and promptly reactive board to kind of re-up that stock plan whenever we need to. So obviously we do it before we ran out, but I can't really tell you when that would be. And it's all going to be a function of the quality and the investment returns that we see on the portfolio side.
Operator: And we'll go next to Nick Del Deo with Moffett Nathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: First on churn, quite churn in the U.S. excluding Metro, Leap or Clearwire stepped up a bit to 1.1% this quarter. And Brendan, in your prepared remarks you said that the 30 basis points of it came from the big four carriers. Can you talk about where the other 80 basis points came from and how persistent it will be? It seems like a fairly high number given only about 10% or so of your revenue comes from non-big four customers?
Brendan Cavanagh: They certainly represent a disproportionate amount of the churn now. So it's really a wide ranging, it's a very long list of a lot of small numbers, Nick. So it includes companies that are even paging companies, other miscellaneous broad, narrowband providers that kind of stuff. It's a lot of cats and dogs.
Nick Del Deo: Should we think of this as persisting for a few quarters until it kind of last itself?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think it should from the standpoint that historically, our churn level excluding these consolidations that we've had, that boosted it up, has been in the 1% to 1.25% range. Over the last year or two, it's been a little bit lower than that. But, I don't think you should assume that it - that that is the new norm. It should be somewhere in that 1% to say 1.25% probably range in the future.
Nick Del Deo: And then Jeff you spent a little more time than normal talking about some of your non-macro initiatives like indoor solutions. Recognizing that they're going off a pretty small base, what should we expect from those - from a growth perspective and should there be more than a few percentage points of total revenue?
Jeff Stoops: I think it'll take a while. They're going to grow really fast. But it's going to be a while before they get to be 1% or 2% of revenue. We're excited about them because it's things that we're very happy with some of the early results in terms of the quality of the venues and what we think will be some very, very good results on a per project basis for us, Nick but still a long way away from being material. But these are the kind of things that you have to start at some point to get there and we're doing it.
Nick Del Deo: What sort of venues are you finding on your sweet spot?
Jeff Stoops: Hospitals, educational facilities, multi-family facilities, large retail organizations are the primary ones and then some extremely unique industrial properties would be ones that come to mind and these are all I'm being a little coy because we have some very big name brand things that we're not quite ready to talk about yet but we will hear it in the not too distant future.
Operator: And we’ll go to Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.
Michael Rollins: Just a few if I could. First, can you give us a sense of what the escalators average are for the domestic and international segments on a cash basis when you look at the revenue bridge for the third quarter? And then second based on the backlog that you have in the pipeline, can you frame where that gross revenue gains in the domestic business can get to on whether it’s a 12 or 24-month perspective? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes Mike on the escalators domestically they're about 3.2% approximately annually on average. And internationally they fluctuate a little bit because the Brazil piece is such a big component of it and they are obviously CPI-based and the CPI has been moving around a little bit down there. We do have some floors though on some of our leases in Brazil out of the Oi leaseback. So when you blend all that together along with other internationals, we’re close to 5% is about the average but that can move a little bit depending on how CPI moves.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, and on the backlog question Mike, in all due respect we don't want to get too much into 2019 guidance but I will tell you the backlogs domestically right now are materially similar to where they were three months ago. So, very substantial and very supportive of additional, very strong bookings.
Michael Rollins: And then maybe on the other side of the equation on the churn side, is there some help that we should think about in terms of where that churn may get to, based on some of the processing that you've described for some of the past carrier consolidations that are taking place?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, on the churn if you're talking specifically domestically, I assume you are. We've got some remaining Metro, Leap and Clearwire that will run off - we mentioned that number was about $13 million of annualized revenue that we expect we’ll lose over the next two years approximately. We have a little bit of iDEN churn in the fourth quarter. And when you kind of move away from those that's where we think roughly about 1% to 1.75% range for all other stuff basically is where we'll be. So for the time being the next so many years that's probably a reasonable level. Maybe a little bit lower in certain periods and slightly higher in others depending on timing of notices but otherwise that's where we think it'll fall out. And eventually it obviously comes down because the revenue base continues to grow. The amount of other types of leases that are turning off is naturally reducing so - but that's been our historical level and we expect it to be similar going forward.
Operator: And we have a question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: So you maintain the guidance at $45 million for the amendments in carriers obviously you're going to see another nice sequential step up in the fourth quarter. I mean, simple math gets me in about $50 million or so for the quarter which is a 30% increase. When I look at past years, fourth quarter new leasing activity the amendments and the carriers seems to kind of roll over into Q1 meaning that you do a certain number of - you do a similar level in Q1 as Q4. Is there any reason to think that it is different this year particularly back-end loaded that that would kind of drop down in Q1 or how should we think about that cadence?
Jeff Stoops: I don't think we know anything today, Walter, that would say there should be an abrupt change particularly given the fact that a lot of this stuff is coming from projects that are multi-year in nature. And frankly, a lot of this nice buildup that we've seen through the year and the reason you are seeing this nice step up in the growth rate as we get to the exit of the year is again frankly because the end of 2017 was not that strong.
Walter Piecyk: Right but even on an absolute basis if you can maintain those levels that's going to set it up for looks like a pretty continual acceleration in the organic growth rate for the company?
Jeff Stoops: Well I mean the business - getting back to your first question, the work that’s coming in and that's filling the backlog today is coming from multi-year projects. No reason why there should be a calendar stop just because the calendar - just because it's December 31.
Operator: Our next question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Jeff, could you just talk a little bit more about the service’s strength and how sustainable do you think that is, well what's driving it? And then on the pipeline, you talked a lot about the strong activity by the big four. Now what are you seeing in pipeline from potential new tenants or other nontraditional carriers? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: I will tell you that a lot of our services business is predominantly weighted towards T-Mobile and Sprint. You'll see that as we file the 10-Q and things. So, that should all continue to do very well. The only thing that of course could possibly change all that would be some changes that could fall out of the announced combination. But short of that, both companies continue to work really hard and go down a path that shows no change at all based on the pending transaction. And, in terms of other folks, Simon, we are actually seeing a fair amount of activity from DISH. And that will probably be the most notable outside of the big four.
Simon Flannery: Activity in terms of the conversations or in terms of leasing?
Jeff Stoops: All the way through to signed leases.
Operator: Our next question from the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Your line is open.
Spencer Kurn: So as you look across the tower space in the U.S., AMT is growing, gross organic growth around 9% versus your 7% today. And it sounds like the 7% is going to climb higher in the fourth quarter. But my question is, is there anything structurally different between your two businesses, why they should be growing faster or as activity continues to build, is the level is 9% within reach over the coming years? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: I would say two things to that. I don't think the calculations are apples to apples, point one. And no, I don't think there's anything structurally different.
Spencer Kurn: And just to follow up, it looks like the biggest increase to your guide came in the other category for revenue. I was just wondering if you could provide some color on what those actions were? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Spencer, it's a handful of a variety of different things. We had some additional revenues that came with what we call cash basis basically have tenants that we don't book revenue on accrual basis based on a category that we put them in, that’s a little bit higher in terms of collections. We had some - a little bit of collections that were higher than what we had included in our projections from out of period billings. We had some termination fees, we had some hold over fees for customers that had canceled leases long ago but hadn't removed their equipment on time. So it's just a wide variety of stuff. But usually it's just to give you kind of perspective on it, when we project that out and we give you the bridge, we kind of use historical norms but we also are a little bit cautious because that stock is a little bit uncertain. So sometimes we have a tendency to see a little bit more than what we project out of a little bit of caution there.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: It's Josh on for Dave. Thanks for taking the questions. On Brazil, I know it's quick but is there any tangible change to the market since the election and have you had any conversations with the carriers down there that might give you – make you feel better or worse kind of going forward?
Jeff Stoops: Hard to say that we've seen a tangible change there. It looks like they may be lifting the spectrum cap which could be very good for the market in terms of activity down there. We'll see the – the other thing that may happen was not going to happen certainly before the election would be the addressing of the concessions down there. That would be to happen along with the spectrum cap lifting before the any kind of large M&A or kind of structural changes can occur in that market. We believe Bolsonaro was in favor of both. So, we'll see. But the spectrum cap was positive. All that was kind of wrapped up in our comments as to why we are optimistic now that he has been elected.
Unidentified Analyst: And did you have any conversations with the carriers. Not naming them individually leading into the election about what they may or may not do depending on who was ultimately elected?
Jeff Stoops: Not that we can comment on.
Operator: And our next question from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Your line is open.
Amir Rozwadowski: A couple questions if I may. In thinking about sort of the growth trajectory of the business, your exit run rate for 2018 seems to be fairly healthy and recognizing that we don't really want to get into 2019 too much here. Are there any potential limitations that are out there right now that could cap some of the growth? I don't know if it's more tower climbers or just the ability to move at the pace that the carriers would like to move that. Is there anything along those lines that you're seeing either through yourselves or through the industry at the moment that could put an upper limit in terms of the potential for growth?
Jeff Stoops: Besides just the basic raw demand. No, I don't think it's going to be anything other than just the amount of orders that ultimately come in the door.
Amir Rozwadowski: And then thinking about sort of the sustainability of the investment environment at this point, I think that there's still been some debate in terms of how some of the new spectrum that could come to market would be optimized or deployed in either via small cells or macro site investment. And yeah, I’m thinking about ranges like 3.7, 3.5, 3.7, to 4.1. How do you think about sort of the opportunity set from a macro perspective for those types of spectrum bands?
Jeff Stoops: Well based on - I think there's still a lot of work and thought to be put into it, but I think the C-Band would be mostly have the greater macro opportunities. The CBRS will be more of a in-building perhaps WiFi substitute which is actually good because it may break through a lot of in-building resistance with owners where economics previously didn't make sense. Small cells, probably is going to benefit from both, but that's not an area that we have certainly the greatest expertise in. But as to the macro sites, probably more of the C-Band than the CBRS. But all-in-all very good for the ecosystems. The more things you have out there and the greater the money and the folks who are participating. Particularly if we can get some other players involved. Maybe some of the non-traditional, the Googles, the Amazons and these are folks who are keenly interested in the CBRS ecosystem. I think it can only be good for infrastructure as a whole.
Operator: We'll go next to Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: A couple of questions. You mentioned rooftops in the script alongside all the other things that you’re talking about and I thought that was sort of a low margin business compared to indoor DAS and venues and so forth. So just wondering what you see in rooftops that might have changed over the years? And then secondly, I was interested in the you talked about strength across the big four in the U.S. and have you noticed any sequential changes in a negative direction in terms of leasing volumes from any single of the big four or is it that universally flat to positive in terms of leasing volumes sequentially from the big four? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: I'll cover the last one first. I mean, it's - we were speaking more as a whole I mean not – there's not total equality in terms of the strength amongst the big four, Jonathan and I'd prefer not to get into who's red hot and who's not. I think you can derive all that from your own readings of their CapEx report. But in terms of rooftops, you're absolutely right. But the beauty of rooftops is you can generally secure them with relationships that require little to no CapEx. But as you know return on invested capital is something we're very much focused on and you can do pretty well there with the right asset.
Jonathan Atkin: Are you planning to leverage rates that you've had for the better part of the last 10 years or are there new assets coming into the portfolio where you would deploy these?
Jeff Stoops: Both.
Jonathan Atkin: And then lastly, I was interested in just inorganic portfolio growth opportunities in the U.S. and do you see the pace changing notably from what we've seen the last couple quarters?
Jeff Stoops: I don't see the pace changing. I think the quality assets in the U.S. will continue to be elusive.
Operator: And our next question from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Two questions if I may. In your press release you noted that you executed a new domestic leasing that was at the highest levels since 2014. And I'm just curious if you adjust for the law large numbers on a percentage basis, would you anticipate based on the leasing that you saw in the third quarter than we can get to a point where you would see the same level of absolute growth that we saw in 2014 somewhere over the next few quarters? And then secondly…
Jeff Stoops: Absolute growth on a percentile basis?
Colby Synesael: No, absolute. So, not on a percentile basis. So, I appreciate that you can’t get to the same percentage rates because of the law of large numbers…
Jeff Stoops: If I go to revenue per tower basis as you mean?
Colby Synesael: Like in terms of growth, yes.
Jeff Stoops: Always added for tower.
Brendan Cavanagh: Probably not Colby. I mean it depends on what period you're talking about. I mean when we said we’re - that was the highest pickup since 2014 that is on a dollars added per site basis. So from that perspective it is what you're saying, it is more dollars signed up on a per tower basis than it has been at any time in the last year.
Jeff Stoops: But not as high as our peak metrics in 2014 on that on that particular metric.
Colby Synesael: So there's still a notable gap between what was done in the third quarter and 2014, even though the next comparable high watermark would be 2014?
Jeff Stoops: Correct.
Colby Synesael: And then, the second question, in your script, you mentioned, [MAT] as MIMO, you mentioned you're seeing activity in the 600 and the 2.5. I am just curious, are those the only two bands that you're currently seeing demand for MAT and MIMO?
Jeff Stoops: Call us back tomorrow because I'm not sure I can give you a perfect answer on that. I want to make sure that I don't misspeak. Those are certainly the two predominant ones.
Operator: Our next question from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Niknam: Just two on rates and debt. Can you talk about the impact of rising rates on forward AFFO per share growth given I think a little over 20% of your debt is floating rate? And then just leverage-wise with rates rising, does that change at all how you're thinking about capital allocation and optimal leverage you'd like to operate the business at given that you've been a little bit closer to the higher end of that 7% to 7.5% range of late? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, I mean, it you can - that's a great question for all of you modelers because you can take our floating rate debt which is very clearly laid out and you can apply the forward curve because it's a LIBOR based instrument that's very clearly laid out. And you can make your own assumptions as to what our interest expense will be going forward. And that's the great question right? And you can actually figure it out to the penny, Matt. So you can answer that question. So what was your second question?
Matthew Niknam: Just about how you're thinking about leverage with rates rising. I know you guys have been fairly comfortable where you are but with the 7% to 7.5% you've been operating at about 7.5%. Is there any change to the way you're thinking about optimal leverage in the current environment?
Brendan Cavanagh: Probably not because of rate but as we get - we're a quarter away from the calendar turn to 2019. That brings us within two years of a dividend. So as we've talked about before we're going to want to – as we enter into that period have probably a 6% handle on our net debt leverage. So we are thinking about it more today than we were a year ago and how we're going to segue into that time period but it's more because of the dividend than it is because of interest rate.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.
Brandon Nispel: Two for Jeff. Number one, Jeff are you seeing any changes in the prices that sellers of portfolios are expecting to get an interest rate rise? Number two, are you having any conversations with any of your customers in the U.S. on LTE spectrum band re-farming for 5G or have you primarily seen amendments at this point from 2G and 3G to LTE?
Jeff Stoops: I don't think anybody is re-farming any 4G because the - there's really no 5G devices or even true equipment out there yet. And my understanding is the 4G is going to sit with the 5G for quite some time so none of that yet. And our sellers are expecting changes. Sellers never expect changes but do they actually get them? I think all that is starting to work through. And it just takes time but interest rates clearly are something that we certainly take into consideration when we bid for assets. And I think other serious and disciplined buyers do as well. So it will have an impact, should have an impact, will have an impact.
Operator: Our next question from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman: With escalating activity through the year coming from the areas that you mentioned FirstNet 602.5, where would you say we are these days right about now in terms of how far those initiatives have worked through your entire footprint percentage wise or in some sort of buckets or innings, however you choose to describe it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Maybe the third inning.
Jeff Stoops: I'm an innings kind of guy, how about the third inning.
Jeff Stoops: I think that's our last question, right, Laurie?
Operator: We do have one remaining question in the queue.
Jeff Stoops: Okay. We'll take that last one and we’ll call it a night.
Operator: We'll go back to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Ric Prentiss: I took it up and see if any questions asked. Jeff I wanted to press a little bit on your comment about open to exploring other markets beyond the Western Hemisphere. Can you share with us what would make an attractive market? I know people have looked at European assets but none of the U.S. guys have really jumped at it. So help us understand as you look at portfolio both outside of markets you're already in. What would make an attractive market and what obviously look at every drag but kind of walk us through how you think about other market?
Jeff Stoops: Well something where we feel after taking into account all the risks and potential negatives weighed appropriately against the potential growth in the upsize we can make a appropriate, positive spread on our way. I mean we're pretty good at this stuff in terms of operations. And we have found that particularly Latin America and South America, Brazil in particular where I think everyone has really kind of been blinded by the movements in the reals to actually how we've really what we've done down there on every other aspect. We take those things and we can take those skills to other markets. Europe for us has been a problem just because the returns haven't been there based on the competition from the European infrastructure funds who fund in euros and can borrow money at zero percent and things like that. So we'll be looking at other conceivably higher risk parts of the globe that of course would have to be carefully looked at and evaluated and would have to come with obviously double-digit plus returns for them to make sense for us. But assuming they did and we did our homework we would not be afraid to go there.
Ric Prentiss: And do you check how many carriers are on, just trying to think - how we should think about the checking of the box and what makes it attractive…
Jeff Stoops: I mean you've got to obviously have to have the right multiplicity of carriers to make the model work. It's going to be very rare if ever situation where you can go into a two carrier market. We have been able to do that Nicaragua for example and done very, very well. But that's I think much more the exception rather than the rule. So you're generally going to be looking at three-carrier market and a relatively evenly spread three-carrier market not a disproportionate three-carrier market. You're going to need - and a lot of these other markets you're going to need to understand the politics and where they all basically feeding off of the telecom industry because there's a lot of that in parts of the world and there's a lot to it, we would never take it lightly but we would never say unequivocally never. I don't think that's what our shareholders expect us to do. They expect us to get in there, do the work and make the right decision.
Operator: I'll turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, thanks everyone for joining us and we look forward to our next call where we will wrap up our year results and give you our 2019 outlook.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all parties joining by phone will be in a listen-only or muted mode. And then later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given to you at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the meeting over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you. Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we'll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2018 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, July 30, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. The second quarter was another very solid quarter for SBA. We continued to gain momentum in both our leasing and services businesses and produced very positive operating results. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $429.9 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $424.7 million. Foreign exchange rates were significantly weaker than our estimates for the second quarter, which we've previously provided with our first quarter earnings release, negatively impacting leasing revenue by $1.4 million. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant-currency basis, was 5.4% over the second quarter of 2017, including the impact of a 1.5% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.9%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 6.4% on a gross basis and 4.7% on a net basis, including 1.7% of churn, a little less than half of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth on a gross basis increased sequentially over the first quarter. As operational domestic leasing activity and backlog levels continue to be strong, we expect to see the year-over-year domestic gross same-tower growth rate increase sequentially throughout 2018. Internationally, on a constant-currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 8.9%, including 80 basis points of churn or 9.7% on a gross basis. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 10.6%, which was also a sequential increase over the first quarter. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue signed up during the quarter, remained strong in the second quarter and well above year-ago levels with solid contributions from each of the big four carriers. Newly signed up domestic leasing revenue came about 2/3 from amendments and 1/3 from new leases, and the big four carriers represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that were signed up during the quarter. Each of our major U.S. customers remained active, investing in their networks, and we expect to continue to see a healthy level of new lease and amendment signings throughout the balance of the year. Internationally, we had another solid leasing quarter, particularly in Brazil, where we had good contributions from both Claro and Vivo. During the second quarter, 85.9% of consolidated cash site-leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.4% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding the revenues from pass-through expenses. With regard to second quarter churn, we continue to see churn from leases with Metro/Leap and Clearwire consistent with our expectations. As of June 30, we have approximately $16 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with Metro/Leap and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next 2 to 3 years. Domestic churn in the second quarter from all other tenants on an annual same-tower basis was 90 basis points. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $337.6 million. Tower cash flow was negatively impacted by $0.9 million in the second quarter due to weaker foreign exchange rates than those previously anticipated. Our industry-leading operating margins remain strong during the quarter. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 82.1% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 68.6% and 90.5%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $318.9 million, which was negatively impacted by $0.8 million due to weaker-than-anticipated FX rate. Our adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were driven by solid results from both our leasing and services businesses. Services revenues in the second quarter were $26.4 million, up 8.8% over the second quarter of 2017. Cash SG&A for the quarter was in line with expectations and continues to remain very low as a percentage of total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.7% in the quarter compared to 70.6% in the year-earlier period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.5%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. AFFO in the second quarter was $213.5 million. AFFO per share was $1.83, an increase of 5.8% over the second quarter of 2017. AFFO was negatively impacted by $0.8 million or $0.01 per share relative to last quarter's forecasted assumptions due to weaker-than-anticipated foreign exchange rates during the quarter. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in expanding our tower portfolio, deploying incremental capital into both new tower builds and acquisitions. During the second quarter, we acquired 224 communication sites for $152.3 million, with most of those sites located in the U.S. We also built 87 sites during the second quarter. As noted in our press release, subsequent to quarter-end, we have acquired 23 additional communication sites for $5 million. In addition, this afternoon, after our press release had been provided to the news wire, we closed the first 451 [ph] sites located in El Salvador from the previously announced acquisition from a local subsidiary of Millicom International. As of today, we have 416 total additional site under contract for acquisition at an aggregate price of $99.3 million, including 360 sites remaining under the El Salvador Millicom transaction. We anticipate that these sites will close throughout the balance of 2018 with some spilling into 2019. We also continue to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $18.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 34 years. Turning now to our updated outlook for full year 2018. The variances in the actual second quarter foreign currency exchange rates versus our assumptions made last quarter, plus the changes in our foreign currency rate assumptions for the remainder of the year, have negatively impacted our full year 2018 outlook by approximately $11 million for site leasing revenue, $7 million for tower cash flow and $6 million for both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Excluding the impact of FX changes, we would have increased our full year leasing revenue outlook by $3 million, tower cash flow by $2.5 million, adjusted EBITDA by $2 million and AFFO per share by 1 10. Our outlook for full year site leasing revenue includes a $1 million increase in domestic organic site leasing revenue growth. Consistent with our historical practice, our updated full year 2018 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those closed or under contract today, and it does not assume any additional debt financings or share repurchases beyond those completed prior to today. We have increased our full year outlook for net cash interest expense, primarily to account for increases in the LIBOR rates since our last earnings release as well as increases in our assumptions for LIBOR throughout the rest of the year. LIBOR impacts interest expense on our floating rate debt, including our $2.4 billion term loan and balances outstanding under our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. These same factors impacting our 2018 full year guidance, FX and interest rates, are, without future improvement, also making it more difficult for us to produce $10 of AFFO per share in full year 2020. Our assumptions around these items when we first put out this goal over 2 years ago, which were largely based on forward-interest rate curves and projections at the time, were materially lower than where we are today. We also projected repurchasing more stock with the same amount of repurchase dollars. Even though our domestic lease up is anticipated to be better in 2018, '19 and '20 than we initially thought it would be, the FX and interest rates spends are looking tough at this point and something we, of course, watch on a daily basis. I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of net debt, and our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.6 times, just above our targeted range of 7 to 7.5 times. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA in the net cash interest expense was 3.5 times. As we disclosed with our first quarter earnings release, we were active in the debt capital markets during the second quarter. On April 11, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we obtained a new $2.4 billion 7-year senior secured term loan B. The term loan was issued at 99.75% of par and will mature on April 11, 2025. It bears interest at LIBOR plus 2% per year. The proceeds of the term loan will use to repay and retire our $1.93 billion of outstanding, existing term loans to pay off the existing outstanding balances under our revolver and for general corporate purposes. In addition to the term loan, we also amended our revolving credit facility at the same time, increasing a total commitments under the facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion; extending the maturity date to April 11, 2023; lowering the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees; and amending certain other terms and conditions. As of today, we have $90 million outstanding under the revolver, currently accruing at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1 50. Our next refinancing obligation is not until late 2019. The weighted average coupon of our outstanding to debt is 3.8%, and our weighted average maturity is approximately 5 years. As previously disclosed, earlier this year, our Board of Directors approved the authorization of a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan. During the second quarter, we spent $306.9 million under this plan to repurchase 1.9 million shares at an average price of $163.44 per share. All the shares purchased were retired. As of today, we had 654.5 million of authorization remaining under the repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at June 30, 2018, are 114.8 million, down from 121 million at June 30, 2017, or 5.1% reduction. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had another very solid, clean, straight-forward quarter. Solid new leasing business booked in the quarter allowed us to increase our 2018 domestic new leasing revenue forecast. Leasing and services backlogs increase we executed well, and we invested incremental capital in both portfolio growth and share repurchases. Operationally, it was a very strong performance. In the U.S., all 4 major U.S. wireless carriers have remained very busy, maintained the increased level of new leasing business signed up that we saw in the first quarter, which drove the increase to our forecasted contribution to full year 2018 leasing revenue from organic, domestic new leasing activity. During the second quarter, we again saw solid leasing contributions from all of our customers, very similar in terms of types and sources of signed new business to what we saw in the first quarter. Backlogs, however, climbed over first quarter end levels, which has increased our confidence in sustained domestic organic leasing growth through the rest of 2018 and into 2019. At this point, we have not seen any impact to organic leasing activity as a result of the announced T-Mobile/Sprint merger, and our interactions with both companies continue to be business as usual. On last quarter's call, we mentioned that we have begun to see 5G-oriented activity on macro sites outside of urban areas. We continue to see this activity and are excited about what 5G ultimately will mean for SBA. Mobile 5G will require the deployment of advanced radios and antennas across carrier macro footprints. With only a small fraction of this deployment happening over the last several quarters, the vast majority of the opportunity is still in front of us. Based on commentary from our customers, much of these 5G deployments will require the use of new NIMO antennas, which are bigger than typical antennas taking up incremental capacity at traditional tower sites and driving incremental revenue opportunities for our industry. We also expect to see additional benefits from the deployment of 5G and higher bands, particularly CBRS and C bands. Upcoming spectrum options, the DISH deployment, the potential resolution of the legato spectrum and other items with all help keep the U.S. market a very interesting and active place for the foreseeable future. Internationally, we also had a very strong leasing quarter, particularly in Brazil. In Brazil, we had solid contributions from all 4 major wireless carriers, including a nice increase in amendment activity with Oi. Oi continues to proceed steadily toward completion of its restructuring. Gross organic same-tower revenue growth increased sequentially in Brazil over the first quarter on a constant-currency basis. The contractual revenue signed up during this quarter in our international markets came about 55% from new leases and 45% from amendments, and we expect the next to remain fairly balanced going forward. Notwithstanding a solid leasing activity during the quarter, we were, of course, disappointed in the material decline in the Brazilian reais in the second quarter. And there maybe some continued bumpy days had before we get to the October presidential elections. But the underlying Brazilian economy seems to be improving, and we believe an opportunity for more stability exists once we have moved beyond the October elections. For example, the Brazilian agribusiness industry is showing real strength in the face of trade issues involving other countries. And increased oil prices, of course, held Brazil's best energy industry. For our part, we continue to focus on helping our customers address the ever-growing demands on their networks and organically growing our revenue base in our existing markets. Operationally across all of our markets, we continue to perform at a high level of efficiency. We continued to convert the vast majority of incremental leasing revenues into tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. In the second quarter, our tower cash flow margin was 79.5%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.7%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin, again, ticked higher year-over-year. We take great pride in these margins and focus on continuing to move them up everyday as we believe they demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness and organization of our support operations, our focus on cost control and the quality of our assets and contracts. With regard to our balance sheet, we continue to believe in the current interest rate environment. The best way to maximize shareholder value is to stay levered at our target range of 7 to 7.5 turns of net debt to last quarter's annualized adjusted EBITDA and investing incremental capital into quality portfolio growth and attractive share repurchases, and we did both in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we added 311 sites to our portfolio, with over 70% of those sites in the U.S. And with the sites we currently have under contract to acquire, we remain negotiate to achieve our 5% to 10% portfolio growth goal this year. In addition, going to second quarter, we spent over $300 million to repurchase 1.9 million of our shares. During the second quarter, we also demonstrated that we remain a highly preferred issuer in the debt markets and the successful term loan financing and an extension and favorable repricing of our revolver. We are extremely attractive credit to investors in each of the debt markets we access for capital, allowing us great flexibility in maintaining our target leverage goals, although we have no debt maturities until late 2019. We believe our access to attractive financing and focus on disciplined tower acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases will continue to allow us to drive increases in shareholder value for growth in AFFO per share. We've had a strong first half of 2018, and we're excited and optimistic about the prospects for the rest of this year and for 2019. I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their contributions to our success. And at this time, Laurie, we're ready to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Jeff Stoops: Hey, Ric.
Ric Prentiss: Hi. Obviously, nice, clean, straightforward quarter. We like those. When we look at - I appreciate your comments also about you've seen no impact from Sprint/T-Mobile merger on the activity. One other one, AT&T FirstNet seemed to have had a little switch in their planning. Originally, we thought they might be doing 20,000-plus sites this year based on their first quarter announcement. And on second quarter call, they kind of said may be 12,000 to 15,000 they would touch this year, still planning to do the whole project. So can you talk a little bit about the pacing you've seen from AT&T? And I interpret this to mean that no change to your guidance even with the change from AT&T kind of stance on '18 work?
Jeffrey Stoops: No. No change to our guidance, but I would take their comments, which is that the second half of the year would need to be busier than the first half would be entirely consistent with our comments.
Ric Prentiss: Great. And you also mentioned, I think, Brendan, that 451 sites closed in El Salvador. That would have been, I guess, already in your guidance because it's under contract or closed, but was there any switch in the timing of that then? Or is it fairly small?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, it's fairly small, but there was a little bit of a delay in terms of our expectations of timing. So it was a month or so, and you can actually kind of see that on our revenue bridge where you see the M&A internationally stepped down slightly. That's what it's due to. But doing that close today, it's now back on track.
Ric Prentiss: And then final question for me. We get a lot of questions and I appreciate the $10 commentary, but we get a lot of questions on can we see with AT&T FirstNet ramping to the second half this year like you pointed out, Jeff, and Sprint hopefully continuing to ramp up their project. Is there the possibility to get back to the 2013 leasing levels? Is it end up somewhere in between? Just people I think are trying to gauge are there inflection points in this business? And how should we think about growth rates with different activity levels we're seeing?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. I think it will be hard to get back to the 2013 growth rates, in large part because you're operating under a much lower revenue for tower base at that time. And if you kind of compound what's happened since then, it takes a whole heck of a lot more dollars per transaction to accomplish the same growth rate. I - and literally somewhere in between, Ric, which is still got to produce, I think of extremely healthy shareholder value creation.
Ric Prentiss: Great. Appreciate the added color.
Operator: And we go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Thank you very much. Jeff, can you just comment on the overall pricing environment, the competitive environment? Any more activity by the two elements [ph] of the world? And then, Brendan, perhaps you can talk about the balance sheet? You went over the top end of your range, 7, 6 [ph] this quarter. You still bought back stock. You have some acquisitions to pay for. But how are you thinking about how you balance all those? And do you want to sort of stay at the high end of the range for the next couple of quarters? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: The pricing environment, Simon, continues to be healthy. Our customers are busy trying to meet some deadlines that they really want to meet. So they - that factors into all of the ways that we look at price. But at the end of the day, we're there to - for a very long-term, productive leadership on both sides. In terms of the other players and their impact on that, it really hasn't had any material effect. A lot of those sites that those folks are seeking are not in areas that we have historically been interested in. And in areas where they are, they are of a very limited nature. So really, it's a fairly optimistic environment for us at this point.
Brendan Cavanagh: Simon, on the balance sheet question, we did end up just slightly ahead of our - or slightly above our range, in part, due to the FX actually coming in a little bit weaker. But it's our intention to stay within the range. We're comfortable at the high-end of the range, but it's really going to be driven by opportunities to buy quality assets or to buy stock opportunistically. So as we see those opportunities, we’re very comfortable staying at the high-end of the leverage range to do that.
Simon Flannery: And you've got to keep the floating balance pretty much where it is as well?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, we did obviously just do a bank financing that increased our floating exposure during this quarter, but it was our first floating rate debt that we raised in the last 3 years. And I would expect our next 5 or so financings to all be in the fixed rate markets. And so I think that our shift - that we'll see a shift in the mix of fixed to floating a little bit back towards fixed a little bit more, but 75% to 80% fixed is our ideal target.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I would just add, wherever we are today coming out of the recent bank and revolver deals, kind of be the high watermark as we move through the next financings, which is Brendan said, are all going to be fixed rate.
Simon Flannery: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead
Phil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thanks. Brendan, I wonder if you can give us some more color on your comment that domestic lease up has been better and expected to be better in '18, '19 and '20 than you thought when you gave the 2020 $10 guide. I assume it's not good enough to offset the FX and interest expense. But can you just go through what's been better over the last couple of years since you gave that guidance?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. It's not been better in that regard over the last couple of years. It's this year and going forward that we expect it will - just based on the backlog that we built up at this point, we expect to see higher leasing results than what we anticipated when we gave that guidance or that target out a couple of years ago. But you'll remember at that time, we were thinking that if the leasing activity could stay similar to what we were seeing at that time, that we'll be able to get to the $10 number. But that also did assume that we would see relatively stable interest and FX rates. And basically, today's interest and FX rates, it's unlikely we would get to the full year 2020, even with the increased lease up that we'd expect to see over the next couple of years. But again, it's really a timing issue. It may just be a couple of quarters delayed from what we originally projected. We will ultimately get to the $10 number, just may not be by full year 2020.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. And I mean, the reason for the optimism, Phil, around the leasing is the projects and the things that are driving leasing today, for the most part, a multiyear projects that we would expect to continue through that 3-year time period.
Phil Cusick: Great. And you also mentioned Oi picking up, can you remind us where you are on concessions, and those tariffs in Brazil?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, the – I mean, we have, portion, I don't know the exact - Brendan, I don't know if you do know the exact number of towers that are wireline towers that are subject to the concession…
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I believe it's approximately 2,100 sites.
Brendan Cavanagh: 2,100 of those, Phil, are concession towers that are, I believe, 2025.
Jeff Stoops: Right.
Brendan Cavanagh: But then Oi has a contractual guarantee through, I believe, 2035 should something happen to the concession that would affect those particular assets.
Phil Cusick: And any changing in Oi's charter as we go through bankruptcy around these concessions?
Jeffrey Stoops: No. No. I think most people are relying on the belief that the government, which has signaled its intent and willingness to change the concession. It just happens to have gotten hung up. Nothings likely to get done until after the presidential elections. Although there hasn't been any real opposition, to my knowledge, to the concept. It's just not something that's going to get done until there's a new regime in place.
Phil Cusick: Understood. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much. And good afternoon, folks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Hey, Amir.
Amir Rozwadowski: I have two questions, if I may. One is really on the allocation of spending dollars with macro site versus small cells. Largely, when we look at Verizon's commentary that they made in bringing their sort of CapEx outlook to the lower end of their guidance, one of the elements of that was their anticipated shift from macro site investing to more small cells. Are you seeing that relative to the activity levels? It doesn't sound like - I just want to clarify.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, it's a hard question for us to answer, Amir, because we don't do a lot of the small cells. And the level of activity that we're seeing today on macro spending is way up from a year ago. So kind of a hard one to answer, could it even more up than way up? I guess, but that's probably the best answer I can give you.
Amir Rozwadowski: No, that's very helpful. So you're still continuing to see very healthy levels of macro site adjustment from that?
Jeffrey Stoops: Certainly compared to a year ago, yes.
Amir Rozwadowski: Okay. That's helpful. And then going back to your commentary around that $10 per share target. Recognizing that some of those factors were FX-related and sort of to factors outside the operational control of the business. How do you think about the long-term AFFO growth rate of the business at this point? I realize there are some nuances to the timing to $10 , but are you still comfortable in terms of your long-term expectations for AFFO growth here?
Brendan Cavanagh: If we can get to a stable FX and a stable interest rate environment, it is absolutely a double-digit AFFO compounding business.
Jeffrey Stoops: One caveat to that, of course, is that a number of years from now we will be becoming a dividend payer as an obligation as a REIT, and that will influence the growth in AFFO per share as that obligation grows. But otherwise, which I’ve said is exactly right, we'd expect it to be a double-digit grower in a stable interest rate and FX environment.
Amir Rozwadowski: Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.
Operator: And we go to David Barden with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just two. Brendan, I think you said the Clearwire Metro/Leap churn was about 6 or - remaining balance is about $16 million. And in the quarter, we have about a $3 million churn, 8 basis points associated with that 8 [ph] basis points. So that would kind of argue that the boil off should be may be in the next 5 or 6 quarters, and you said something about the next several years. So if you can give us a sense as to the trajectory or what the determining factors are for that churn kind of getting behind us? And then the second one was just picking up - sorry again, this $10 number, but back in the day, what it informs that was the forward rate curve for the Brazilian real and the forward rate corporate interest rate. I mean now, like it's now challenging. We might not get there right on time, but may be not really ready to throw the tower yet. What are the breakpoints? If we have the 400 real after the presidential election, is that - that's just going to put a nail in that? Or if we get 300, it's definitely back on the table. Can you kind of put some parameters on this, as we watch rates in the real, we kind of get a sense as to how you're thinking about the business, it will be helpful? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. First, on the churn question, David. I don't feel - I think the number you're using is based on the percentage that we gave. That's actually a same-tower numbers reflective of the trailing 12 months activity, but it is $16 million of remaining annual revenue that we have from those guys that we expect to churn off. And our projections just based on when lease term end dates are and when they can basically get out of the agreements is that, that will take about 2.5 years approximately to churn off. So that's where the 2 to 3 years comes from.
David Barden: And we should prorate over that period, you think?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I think, sometimes it comes in waves. But for the most part renewal dates are spread relatively evenly, so I think probably a little more in the next 12 months or so. But on average, it's not going to be materially different than prorating it.
Jeffrey Stoops: On the second question, David, I think we're going to respectfully decline to answer that. I will tell you that we are at a point where there are 4, and really only 4 variables at this point. It's the lease up rate, it's interest rates, it's the Brazilian reais and it is the multiple leve, which we repurchased our stock or purchase assets. I would like to come back to this after the presidential election in Brazil and probably when we get our full year guidance out for 2019 because prior to that, just becomes a daily exercise. I'm not sure if that's useful.
David Barden: All right, Jeff. Thanks for that.
Operator: We go next to Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, you guys acquired a lot more towers in the U.S. this quarter than you had in a while. Is there anything worth calling out there right around the dealer deals you consummated to get there? Or the M&A market in the U.S. in general? Is this sort of - should we think of this as a one-off? Or is it going to change in pricing expectations by sellers so you can pick up more assets than you have…
Jeffrey Stoops: No. I think you should view it as a one-off. We had an opportunity to pick up some quality assets, and we did.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. And then on Verizon, talking about shutting out the CDMA network at the end of 2019. Obviously, you guys won't see any sort of immediate rent step down because of that, but I was hoping you could talk about the puts and takes we should be thinking about overtime stemming from 3G de-commissioning?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, what typically happens when there is a de-commissioning of a prior technology is the entitlements get rolled into the equipment that's needed. So it will, at worst, typically from our perspective, results in some lessening, perhaps, of amendment rates while they swap out antennas or create some capacity for what's needed back. So that's really how it's worked in the past, Nick.
Nick Del Deo: We did you see any sort of material impact along those lines when AT&T shut down its 3G network?
Jeffrey Stoops: No...
Nick Del Deo: Okay. All right. Thanks
Operator: And we go to Mike Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.
Mike Rollins: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. So just back to kind of a longer-term financial strategy of the company. Can you talk more about as you move through 2020 and beyond, you mentioned leverage a few times? How should investors think about the amount of deleveraging that you'd like to see in the model? And where those net-debt leverage ratio should end up, were those in 2020 time frame or even a few years beyond that? And then secondly, if you look at the tower cash flow margins x pass-throughs, there is a sequential dip 1Q to 2Q. And just curious if there's anything out of trend, either last quarter or this quarter, that we should think about as you are managing the tower cash flow margin for the company x the pass-throughs. I think it's Slide 12 in the supplementals? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, our game plan, Mike, would be to be somewhere in the 6s, as we become a dividend payer because we'll start small and then grow the dividend from there. And probably, the one thing that we have not yet decided with [indiscernible] is whether as a dividend-paying company, will we feel the need to become an investment-grade company. And that ultimately will be the primary driver of our ultimate leverage positioning. But I could tell you now that we would -- as we move into a dividend payer, we'll move from the 7s to the 6s.
Brendan Cavanagh: Mike, on the tower cash flow margin, there's a few different factors that affected that. Some of those had to do with certain non-recurring type items and also some of the assets that we’ve guided during the period that come on at lower margins and new builds that we've done as well. So as of those kind of get blended in, they help to kind of pull it down as well. So it's not really representative of any shift in trend or anything. I think you'll continue to see it grow on average on the base business over time.
Mike Rollins: Thanks very much.
Operator: And we go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman: Thanks. And I hate to do this, but I do have another question about the $10 guidance and the shift in timing. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you'd indicate that when you originally set that target, you're assuming fairly steady levels of leasing and you've now acknowledged it. Leasing is indeed higher than your thought about particularly in '18, '19 and '20. What I'm curious is as you assess the timing to get there, are you still assuming that '18, '19 and '20 are steady years? Because the commentary you've made about the back half of '18 and the entry rate into '19, and prior '19 probably is going to be a better year. So I'm just wondering if maybe you're using a little bit more conservatism with that long-term target relative to maybe what you have the line of sight around for right now.
Jeffrey Stoops: We do think as we sit here today, and we don't want to get too far ahead on '19 guidance, but let's just say we think '19 should certainly be at least as good as 2018, how about if we say that? But problem, Brett, is when is the Fed going to stop raising short-term interest rates to which LIBOR has almost a perfect correlation? What is the Brazilian reais going to be 2020? It almost doesn't matter what the Brazilian reais is today. What is it going to be in 2020? That means everything to the $10 by '20. I mean, those are the things that are ultimately going to dictate where the final number comes out.
Brett Feldman: Okay, got it. If you don't mind, I do have one other question about the comment you made totally different topic. You said that you're seeing some 5G activity in your markets. And obviously, we don't have the standards-based gear yet. But I'm just curious, what is 5G activity? And then we will be incremental activity when that gear comes to market?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, MIMO antennas, we're starting to see very little. That means, to your point, there's no phones yet that - and I'm not even sure when they start to come out when the first handheld devices are really out there. So there's a long, long path left for activity in that area.
Brett Feldman: Thank you.
Operator: And we go to a Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So just touching on your backlog of activity. It sounds like it's up year-over-year and sequentially. Last quarter, when you thought about second quarter backlogs, I think you said it might increase or might plateau. Do you have any visibility on where it's going for the rest of the year? Are we - is it from what you've seen so far in Q3, is it continuing to rise sequentially?
Jeffrey Stoops: It has risen in the month of July. That's about all I can tell you.
Spencer Kurn: Got it. Thanks. And just one more, if I may. On the 5G deployments that you've seen, how do the amendment rates, prices compare to a typical amendment rate of around $500 a month? And then on top of that, how do you think about the amendments you may see from millimeter wave spectrum? My understanding is the equipment is a lot smaller than what we have deployed today, so I'm just curious how you think about pricing, something like that.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. On the - your first question, although where we're seeing it on the more traditional spectrum bands, is typically larger antennas, in some cases, with radios, in some cases, not. And where we're seeing that, you are getting increase pricing over a smaller package, and that's consistent with our history and how we approach the pricing of our towers base. In terms of the millimeter wave, Spencer, we have not seen or price a whole lot of that at this point so I'll have to get back to you on that.
Spencer Kurn: Okay. Well, thanks again.
Operator: And we go to Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk’: Thanks. We talked about the - I think in the comments about, excluding impact of FX changes, the revenue, the full year leasing revenue outlook would be plus 3. Did I get that right?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes.
Walter Piecyk’: There will be another two on the international with the one you just increased the domestic by 1 million, right?
Brendan Cavanagh: We increased the organic domestic by 1 million, that's right. I think if you look at the bridge, it's on the first page of the supplemental package, we'll be able to see the changes in there. So we have - one there and I think one on the non-organic M&A side for the domestic, domestic was up 2 and the international was down 10, but 11.5 was FX.
Walter Piecyk’: Right. So if we 5 [ph], we look at first half of the year and what's happened so far, I mean, it implies I think about a 40% growth second half over first half? And if the reason that you're still confident in that 45 just because you basically - you have these orders from these operators and you just know that they're getting it put on the towers at certain times, it's just that, that's the visibility that gets you to the 45. And is that a way for us to kind of may be rationalize why when we look at Verizon's CapEx, it was down as much as it was in this quarter? I guess that was more on the fiber side, but just CapEx in general down at Verizon that this second half ramp, not that they're the only ones that really deliver that ramp, but that's what give you confidence in the second half? Or you just - you almost know when you think you're going on your towers?
Jeffrey Stoops: A lot of the confidence is driven by the stuff we already signed. So we signed a lot of leases and amendments that our either just commencing now or is scheduled to commence in the future. So a lot of it is based on stuff that is or already booked with minor amount based on the backlog that we got and expectations for signing. But most of it at this stage of the year, because we're so far through the year, is based on stuff that we've largely executed already.
Walter Piecyk’: Understood. So 40% is pretty massive in terms of increase?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. I think depending on how you're measuring. Remember, this is a full year over full year item so...
Walter Piecyk’: The ramp in the new lease activities you know, second quarter is obviously bigger than first quarter, but it's going to be looking hockey stick-ish I think in the third and fourth quarter to hit that number?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. Well, we've had a lot more leasing activity in the first half of this year than we had certainly last year, particularly the second half of last year.
Walter Piecyk’: Great...
Jeffrey Stoops: The quarter was probably our low quarter last year.
Walter Piecyk’: Right. So Jeff just to tie that to the 2019 comments, you're already up 40% in the second half. And then [indiscernible] plus, and now you're saying also you're expecting more sequential growth in 2019 as well on top of what's going to be a very aggressive second half of the year. Do I understand that right?
Jeffrey Stoops: We're not 100% sure what the 40% is, but we certainly…
Brendan Cavanagh: Your number, Walter. We're saying that we had a okay 2017. We had a better first half. We're going to have a better second half. And right now it feels like 2019, we think, will look more like the second half than the first half.
Walter Piecyk’: Right. No, it's pretty basic math. I just backed into lower numbers in the first half. So to get to that 45 to put together your Slide 2, there has to be a big ramp in new leasing activity to make that happen. And Jeff, you were talking about 2019 sequential growth on top of that. I mean, it seems like we're embarking on kind of a new era in terms of that type of growth?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. I mean, we've seen material growth. I mean, we'll definitely go with the numbers afterwards to make sure we're on the same page there.
Walter Piecyk’: You bet you. But just one last question. Has DISH - have you signed a deal with DISH for any towers? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: They are in the backlog.
Walter Piecyk’: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we go to Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Great. Thank you. It looks like excluding churn from Leap Clearwire PCS, normal churn picked up at Taiwan [ph] and probably gotten to just that’s its going - continue to go up just a little bit. Can you talk about what the driver of that would be? And then another follow-up on the $10 AFFO guide. If you should have assumed that the FX and interest rate pulled at current levels, would you have coming in line with that target?
Jeffrey Stoops: On the churn question, we do not necessarily expect the churn on other items to increase, but just as a reminder, there is some [indiscernible] churn that is scheduled to take place in the fourth quarter. I think that's why you're seeing that there's kind of an implied, and that's what that is. But otherwise, the increase over the last couple of quarters is really due to just kind of just certain other non-big four type of tenants and the timing when those churn off, and we wouldn't expect anything materially change there. One direction or the other, that amount is fairly consistent with where we were about a year ago.
Walter Piecyk’: Okay.
Brendan Cavanagh: And then in term, we're not actually going to -- we're not going to parse this $10 by '20 anymore. It's four things, and we could do a variation a day. I'm sorry, but as of right now, FX and interest rates are making it very difficult for us even with a more rosy outlook for domestic leasing.
Walter Piecyk’: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question, Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just on M&A, I think Nick had asked about domestic, but I'll ask it in terms of international and what you're seeing internationally. And then maybe just on the back of that as well. What's your appetite for taking more international M&A just given where you are today with leverage in some of the FX headwinds you’re facing? Thanks
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, there's more available internationally than there is domestically as we've seen and shown over the last couple of years. And yes, we have to take a look. I mean, our - we do have an appetite to grow the portfolio. We've had some great success internationally over the years. Our returns in Brazil over time have been great. We're ahead of plan on a constant currency basis. We're certainly not discouraged with Brazil and the big picture over one quarter. I mean, Brazil grew - it was probably our fastest growing market this quarter and probably for the first half of the year. So we would have an appetite, Matt. We would look at things case-by-case. We'd apply the saying discipline and methodology. We always do. We would apply a currency factor to the analysis and the ROIC and if it hit, we would - we'd be interested in moving forward. Now over time, we always are mindful in the overall governor for our capital allocation is the leverage, so we're not interested for any transaction that's going to take us for more than a temporary period of time above the 7 to 7.5. That's going to be much more of a defining point than a particular international market.
Matt Niknam: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to Robert Goodman with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Robert, we have your line open. Okay, we’ll close that line Robert. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We'll go to Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Amy Yong: Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk through some of the growth characteristics of the towers you bought from Millicom and maybe the operating environment there? Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, El Salvador is a 4-carrier market, which we like. Millicom is the leader in that market. Tigo [ph] is their brand name there. So we have towers that I think are going to prove to be attractive to the other players there, particularly if they're interested in gaining at least the network of the market share leader. They're relatively low-lead tenant to towers today. I believe they are 1.2, may be 1.3 tenants per tower. A lot of upward growth opportunities there, a lot of opportunities to improve the margins through land purchases, which we've had with towers that we already own in El Salvador a great degree of success. So we're pretty excited about the opportunity.
Amy Yong: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we go to Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Thank you. In previous generation upgrades, obviously, 4G being the most recent maybe the most significant, we've seen notable accelerations in growth. And as we now approach 5G, do you think that there's still an opportunity to see those accelerations in growth? Are we now at a point where it's because of law of large numbers or carriers having a certain number of self and deploying in new states for growth be relatively consistent. You mentioned for example a future growth opportunities like the CBRS or the C band. It seems like right now the acceleration that was spoken about a few times on this call into 2019 and perhaps '20 is driven almost exclusively by AT&T. But when that goes away, what do you think the growth rate of the sector looks like thereafter?
Jeffrey Stoops: I don't know that I'd agree it's just AT&T, Colby. Over 20 years, the industry has been fueled by some big booms in technological, generational technological booms. And I would say certainly, the move from 3G to 4G was the biggest. And I don't know that 4G to 5G will be as big, not the least of which reasons is the law of larger numbers. But all through that - those periods, there's - people don't stop innovating. They don't stop improving radios and antennas, and you just keep moving and the law - it's interesting, one statistic that I've always heard is that the average life of an antenna in our customer's business is 3 years, and it's not because of weather. It's not because of the fact that it wears out. It's because of technology. So things have always changed, and there's always new and better stuff that our customers seek to deploying their network to remain on the cutting-edge and I don't really see that changing. So was that an inflection point? Or is it just a long, constant upward path? I don't know the answer to that, but I think it means there's always going to be things to do.
Colby Synesael: And I guess just my follow-up question. It appears to be more mature state as you go forward, seems like the biggest driver of multiples might be things outside of your control, whether it's things like FX or it is interest rates. Under that environment, do you start to think about creating strategic value for your shareholders differently? Or does the same game plan that served you so well looking back continue to be the same?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I think you'll always have to look at all, all paths of creating shareholder value. But FX, we could wake up after the election and we could be back at 3 0 [ph]. And we've seen last - remember last year, we were the beneficiary of favorable movements in FX. So those are cyclical type issues that, over time, our industry has weathered very well, and we've always been able to create value. So the playbook may change a little bit, but I think the basic playbook is going to stay intact.
Colby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'll turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter earnings release.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA First Quarter Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given to you at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the VP of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2018 and beyond. In today's press release, and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 30, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn it over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA began the year with a very solid quarter. We produced positive results in both our domestic and international leasing operations as well as realizing incremental contributions from our services business. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $430.5 million and cash site leasing revenues were $425.1 million. Foreign exchange rates slightly weaker than our estimates for the first quarter, which we previously provided with our fourth quarter earnings release negatively impacting leasing revenue by point $0.2 million. Same tower recurring cast leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which calculated on a constant currency basis was 5.2% over the first quarter of 2017, including the impact of 1.4% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6.6%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 6.2% on a gross basis and 4.7% on a net basis, including 1.5% of churn, 53% of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. As mentioned on our previous earnings call, our modest operational domestic leasing seen activity during the fourth quarter of 2017 will impact our reported leasing revenue and year-over-year gross same tower growth rate in early 2018, but we expect this growth rate to increase sequentially throughout 2018. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 8.3^% including 80 basis points of churn or 9.1% on a gross basis. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 10.1%. Domestic operational leasing activity representing new revenue signed up during the quarter was up from the prior quarter as we began to convert some of our increased application backlog into signed agreements. Revenue from this tiny activity will begin to be recognized at various times throughout the year. Newly signed up domestic leasing revenue came about two thirds from amendments and one third from new leases and the big four carriers represented 97% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Our domestic leasing application backlog remains elevated and we expect to continue to see a very healthy level of new lease and amendment signings over the balance of the year. International operational leasing activity was also solid in the first quarter with positive contributions from all of our markets and Brazil in particular. During the first quarter, 84.6% of cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil. With Brazil representing 13.9% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 10% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass through expenses. With regard to first quarter churn, we continue to see churn from leases with Metro, Leap in Clearwire consistent with our expectation. As of March 31, we have approximately $17 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to turn off over the next two to three years. Domestic churn in the first quarter from all other tenants on an annual same tower basis was 70 basis points. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $339 million. We continue to have success managing the direct cost associated with our towers, allowing us to continue to produce industry leading operating margin. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 82.6% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 68.4% and 90.3% excluding the impact of pass through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $318.8 million. Our adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were due to solid results from both our leasing and services businesses. Services revenues in the first quarter were $27.8 million, up 7.8% over the first quarter of 2017. Cash SG&A for the quarter was a little better than expectations, due in part the delays on the timing of certain international headcount additions, as well as the timing of certain other expenses expected to be incurred later in the year. Cash SG&A continues to remain very low as a percentage of total revenue and speak to the efficiency of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.4% in the quarter compared to 69.7% in the year earlier period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.2%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. AFFO in the first quarter was $218.4 million. Our AFFO per share increased 9.5% to $0.85. AFFO was aided during the quarter by approximately $2 million of lower non-discretionary CapEx than previously anticipated. About half of which is expected to still be incurred later in 2018. During the first quarter we also continued to expand our portfolio, investing incremental capital into both new tower builds and acquisitions. During the first quarter we acquired 334 communication sites for $106.7 million with 300 of these sites located internationally. We also built 67 sites during the first quarter. Subsequent to quarter end we have acquired 190 additional communication sites at an aggregate purchase price of $119.5 five million. Also, as of today we have 874 additional sites under contract for acquisition at an aggregate price of $182.7 million, including the previously announced 811 sites located in El Salvador to be purchased from a local subsidiary of Millicom International. We anticipate these sites will close throughout the balance of 2018. We also continue to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter we spent an aggregate of $16.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is approximately 32 years. Looking forward now, to the balance of the year our earnings press release includes an update to our outlook for full year 2018. We have increased our full year leasing revenue guidance on a constant currency basis, although we have slightly decreased our GAAP full year outlook reflecting the negative impact of changes in our foreign currency rate assumption for the remainder of the year. These changes to our foreign currency assumptions negatively impacted our full year outlook for site leasing revenue by $8 million and also our full year outlook for tower cash flow adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $5 million each. In addition, we have lowered our full year expectation for straight line leasing revenue by $2 million. Excluding the impact of FX changes and straight line revenue changes, we have increased our full year leasing revenue outlook by $7 million, consisting of $1 million reduction in churn expectations, $2 million increase in nonorganic revenue contributions largely related to timing and $4 million increase in other revenue items such as pass through reimbursable expenses and other miscellaneous revenues. The increases to our full year cash revenue outlook also positively impact our full year outlook for tower cash flow, which has been increased by $7 million on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA, which has been increased by $8 million on a constant currency basis. The increase in the adjusted EBITDA outlook includes an approximately $1 million benefit as a result of our strong first quarter services and SG&A results. Since it has only been two months since our last guidance, we are leaving our gross organic growth outlook unchanged. Our updated full year 2018 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those closed or under contract today and it does not assume any additional debt financing or share repurchases beyond those completed prior to today. Our updated outlook incorporate the interest cost impact of our term loan B financing closed earlier this month, which Mark will discuss in more detail in a moment. We raised an incremental $470 million in this financing after the repayment of our existing term loans. We also continue to assume a slightly increasing LIBOR rate throughout the rest of the year impacting our floating rate debt. As a result of our recent financing activities as well as the additional dollars invested or under contract to be invested in new assets or stock repurchases since we provided our initial 2018 outlook, we have increased our full year outlook for net cash interest expense by $13 million. Notwithstanding our increase to our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook, we have lowered our full year AFFO outlook by $10 million primarily as a result of this increase in anticipated interest expense. Our assumption of no incremental capital allocation beyond that under contract as of today means we have not fully put the new money to work for purposes of guidance, which combined with the increased interest expense assumption now included has resulted in a decrease of $1.5 at the midpoint of our full year AFFO per share outlook. Excluding the negative impact of the change in foreign currency assumptions our full year outlook for AFFO per share would have increased by $0.02 from our initial outlook, even with the additional interest expense. With that I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and our balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Brendan. SBA ended the first quarter with 9.3 billion of net debt and our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times, right in the middle of our targeted range of 7 to 7.5 times. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.6 times. At the end of the quarter we had 235 million outstanding under our revolver. We were active in the debt capital markets during and subsequent to the first quarter with the completion of two large financings. On March 9, we issued to our tower trust 640 million of secured tower revenue securities at a fixed interest rate of 3.448% payable monthly. These securities have an anticipated repayment date of March 9, 2023 and a final maturity date of March 9, 2048. The proceeds of this offering in combination with borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to repay in full our 2013-1C and 2013-1D tower securities as well as approved and unpaid interest. Additionally, on April 11, through a wholly owned subsidiary, we obtained a new $2.4 four billion seven year senior secured term loan. The term loan was issued at 99.75% of par and will mature on April 11, 2025. It bears interest that our election at either the base rate plus 1% per year or LIBOR plus 2% per year. We have typically used one month's LIBOR to determine our interest rate. The current interest rate under the term loan is 3.9%. The proceeds of the term loan were used to repay and retired our 1.93 billion of outstanding existing term loans to pay off the existing outstanding balances under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. We're very pleased with this transaction as we were able to reduce our interest rate spread and improve flexibility under our credit agreement, while also extending our maturity dates. We were able to take advantage of a strong market to upsize this financing and raise an incremental 470 million of debt capital. This financing is supportive of our efforts to maintain our target leverage levels and maintain a level of 20% to 25% floating rate debt as we anticipate our next five or so financings will likely be with fixed rate instruments. Also, this facility will allow us to more efficiently use our international assets as collateral. In addition to the term loan, we also amended our revolving credit facility at the same time. The amendment increased the total commitments under the facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion and extended the maturity date to April 11, 2023, lower the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees and amended certain other terms and conditions under our senior credit agreement. Amounts borrowed under the revolver will bear interest at our election at either the base rate plus a margin that ranges from 12.5 basis points to 75 basis points or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 112.5 basis points to 175 basis points, in each case based on borrow leverage. As of today we have $100 million outstanding under the revolver, currently accruing at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.5%. Pro forma for these new transactions, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.8% and our weighted average maturity is approximately five years. As mentioned with our fourth quarter earnings release, on February 16, our Board of Directors approved the authorization of a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan replacing the prior plan. During the first quarter, we spent $38.5 million under this plan to repurchase 200,000 shares at an average price of $161.60 per share. Subsequent to the first quarter we spent an additional 261.5 million under this plan to repurchase 1.6 million shares at an average price of $164.82 per share. All the shares repurchased were retired. As of today we have $700 million authorization remaining under the repurchase plan. Share repurchases are an important component of our ability to continue growing AFFO per share. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2018 are 116.5 million, down from 121.3 million at March 31, 2017 and down over another 1.5 million shares in this month of April. With that I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. As you've heard we are off to a very good start in 2018. We delivered strong first quarter financial results, continued to see strength in both the domestic and international leasing environments, expanded our tower portfolio by 400 sites, reduced our outstanding share count through stock repurchases and completed two significant debt financings. We continue to be well positioned for 2018 and beyond. In the US all four major US wireless carriers have been very busy driving our domestic leasing application backlog to the highest level in several years. During the first quarter we saw an increase in contracted revenues signed up above levels we saw during any point over the last two years. This increase in signings has been in line with our expectations coming into the year and it will support solid growth in our future reported financial results as these executed agreements begin at various times throughout the year to produce revenue. During the first quarter, we saw solid leasing contributions from all of our customers including new leases and amendments signed with Sprint under the master lease agreement we entered into with them in the fourth quarter and amendment activity related to AT&T's FirstNet initiative. We expect to continue to see contributions from both of these projects as well as continued solid activity from our other US customers as we move through 2018, although we obviously will be monitoring any potential impacts on our operational activity levels as a result of the recently announced Sprint/ T-Mobile merger. With regard to this merger it is very new news. And thus there will be still a lot to be learned. Some things we found interesting in yesterday's presentation where the amount and speed of additional investment contemplated, the commitment to rural markets, the focus on the low and mid band spectrum and macro site architecture and the goal of adding equipment to make all spectrum available at all sites prior to materials site decommissioning. We look forward to learning more and working with both T-Mobile and Sprint to help them achieve their goals over the next months and years. Interestingly and a point that was specifically made on the T-Mobile/Sprint call yesterday, we have begun to see 5G oriented activity on macro sites outside of urban areas consistent with the vision put forth yesterday by T-Mobile and Sprint. We have begun to receive amendment applications for new MIMO antennas, which are just now becoming available in higher performance designs and that will facilitate much faster speeds using existing low and mid band spectrum. These new MIMO antenna are generally wider and deeper than current antennas and in some cases way over twice as much. We continue to execute at a high level, converting the vast majority of our incremental operational leasing activity into tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. In the first quarter, our domestic tower cash flow margin was a very strong 82.6% and our company wide adjusted EBITDA margin was likewise very strong at 70.4%. We believe the strength of these margins is clear evidence of the efficiency and solid cost controls with which we run the business as well as the quality of our assets and contracts. Internationally we also had a positive start to the year including a stronger start in Brazil than we had a year ago. Carriers are active throughout all of our international markets and the wave of growth in wireless mobile data consumption will continue to drive network investment throughout our Latin American markets in particular. The contractual revenues signed up during this quarter in our international markets came about half from amendments and half from new leases and we expect a fairly balanced mix going forward. Brazil specifically had another strong quarter in terms of operational leasing activity and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our assets there. We are however, disappointed in the 10% decline in the Brazilian real in the last three months and actually almost in the last month and the offsetting financial impact it will have on what we expect to be strong operational results from Brazil. We're a bit puzzled by the decline given the improving Brazilian economy rising GDP and declining interest rates and inflation and we understand that the decline seems to be mostly brought about by political anxiety around the October elections. We continue to be optimistic about the future. As a result, we have continued to be active and allocating our capital to both new assets and share repurchases. During the first quarter we added 400 sites to our portfolio with 90% of those sites coming in international markets. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired another 190 sites with most of those in the US. As a result and combined with the sites we currently have under contract to acquire, we believe we are in good shape to exceed the low end of our range of 5% to 10% portfolio growth again this year. We have continued our approach of focusing on high quality assets and markets well suited to the macro tower business at prices that will drive incremental value for our shareholders. As has always been our behavior, we continue to believe it is imperative to stay disciplined and not overpay for assets. This discipline has meant and will likely continue to mean that we have more investment capital available than we have attractive portfolio growth investment opportunities. We have therefore allocated incremental capital for share repurchases when we believe our stock is trading below its intrinsic value. At the end of Q1 and into April, we have cumulatively spent 300 million to purchase 1.8 million shares. We believe a healthy mix of both quality asset growth and attractive share buybacks will continue to create value. In order to continue to meet our capital allocation goals, we intend to continue to stay within our target net debt range of 7.0 to 7.5 times at least until such time or close to such time as will become a dividend paying entity. Toward that goal we've already had a very successful start to 2018 with two significant financings. The first was the $640 million securitization refinancing completed in March. The second, our $3.65 billion financing completed in April. The bank financing, which consisted of the $2.4 billion term loan B and $1.25 billion revolver was the single largest capital raised in our history and the first raise of new money for us in the bank market in three years. We achieved historically tight pricing spreads on this transaction. We added incremental capacity and flexibility to our capital structure. We believe these recently completed transactions reflect our continued strong access to attractively price capital. The solid accomplishments of the first part of 2018 in concert with the significant network needs of our customers give us great optimism for continued solid performance in 2018 and beyond. I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their contributions to our success and with that Noah we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks, good afternoon guys. Obviously we had a busy Sunday with the Sprint/T-Mobile merger announcement, Jeffrey talked about there. Can you update us a little bit on also what the remaining life is that you have on your Sprint and T-Mobile leases and is the new MLA with Sprint, is that a take or pay, is that kind of a guarantee you were just trying to think through their synergies wise and what it means for you guys?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, hey Ric, it's Brendan. In the press release we actually did disclose some information regarding our Sprint and T-Mobile contracts including the stair of revenue that each represent for us as well as on the overlap site how much revenue comes from each. Just to give you those numbers quickly, on the sites where we have both Sprint and T-Mobile today, Sprint represented 5.9% of our total cash site leasing revenue and T-Mobile was 6.2%. In terms of the remaining terms, Sprint has on average approximately six years left and T-Mobile approximately three years left, but the range of those is quite broad, so in the case of sprint it's between one and thirteen years, in the case the T-Mobile it's between one and ten years.
Jeff Stoops: We did get some nice average term elongation from that MLA Ric and that is in fact a hard obligation which will not be impacted by the news of yesterday.
Ric Prentiss: And I'm getting a lot of questions about acquired network churn, obviously it's coming down, but if you look back to the days when we Leap, Metro and Clearwire got acquired like in 2013 and 2014, how long was it before you - when the deals closed or when you started getting notification of churn and then the churn started occurring? I'm just trying gauge if the Sprint/T-Mobile deal is approved what sort of timeframe we should be thinking about given those average lives and your past history with other transactions?
Jeff Stoops: It's hard to generalize what happened with those deals and with this deal, given the disparate spectrums and the large number of folks that need to be migrated over. I think the commentary that was given yesterday that talked about really making sure they had all the spectrum available at all the sites that were going to remain before they started any decommissioning, I think is going to take it at face value. I think that is going to make this a longer process than what we saw with certainly with AT&T and Leap for example and then even the case with T-Mobile and Metro. But even in those cases it was several years after closing before you really started to see any type of termination notices.
Ric Prentiss: Okay, the final question for me is as you look at AT&T, FirstNet and Sprint starting to ramp their applications, how long is the process from application to revenue getting booked? I know you said varies, but just trying to gauge, is it three months still for amendments or is it six or nine, just what should we think about that timeframe?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, you left out a critical component which is the execution of the final document whether be an amendment or a lease and then the most critical element is the revenue commencement date, which can be as short as immediately upon an amendment to as long as the greater of a date in the future or installation, so that's really the missing link to your question Ric. But to generalize from - it's actually hard to generalize from application because there's a lot -
Ric Prentiss: I should have said execution. I really meant that lease up.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, from execution to six months or nine, usually the outside.
Ric Prentiss: Great, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Next we go to Nick Del Deo at MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, now I recognize that you can't give us numbers, but are the monetization rates you're starting to get for FirstNet consistent with what you anticipated coming into the process and are they consistent with other amendments you've negotiated for comparable deployment in the past?
Mark DeRussy: They are and I would say though that they're very greatly Nick. Wide variety of equipment loads are being requested. Given the wide variety of circumstances from which the sites that are being touched are coming from. And the averages are where we thought, but it's - the goalposts - the end zones are pretty wide.
Nick Del Deo: Thanks got it. That makes sense. And then maybe one on Sprint/ T-Mobile, I mean, it seems like there's a potential for a healthy amount of amendment revenue involved in moving Sprint's spectrum onto T-Mobile sites and vice versa. Yeah, I know it's early and we don't know a lot, but given what we do know about their spectrum holdings and they're only sharing one band in common, is it appropriate to think that the rate for, I mean covering that sort of package would be a fair bit higher than average or do you think there are other factors we should take into consideration?
Jeff Stoops: Well, I think we have to see ultimately what the configurations look like. To my knowledge today and I'm not a product expert, but to my knowledge there is no single radio unit and certainly no single antenna unit that covers the spectrum, covers the range of spectrum that will be deployed by the combined company, so you're looking at multiple units to cover that full array of spectrum and then if you start to get to the desired MIMO configuration on the antennas that actually could add quite a bit of weight and that - obviously depending on the load of things like that that will impact the price, so that there that there could be a wide range of about outcomes there.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: And next we will go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Thanks a lot. Maybe you could just touch on International a little bit? You talked about good momentum in Brazil, can you just talk about Oi specifically what's the latest on their restructuring on the - their capital plans and then any other markets that you're seeing good momentum in and then I think you said 97% of the leasing was to big four, any interesting trends from Dish or others outside of the big four? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, the Oi restructuring plan continues to move forward as intended. June is a critical date where I believe the debtors will make some decisions on whether or not they will continue to insist on Oi reaching an agreement with the government of the outstanding Anatel fines, so that's something that we're watching. People expect there to be a resolution there that will allow Oi to move forward, be capitalized and emerge and start more greatly investing in its network and obviously that's something that we're optimistic and hopeful for as well. In terms of the markets, Central America not every country, but it seems like at any given time one or two countries in Central America is hot bearing the region we continue to see very good activity in Ecuador, starting to see good activity in Peru, although relatively new in that country. We think Brazil's going to be good all year long. We're just generally continued to be very pleased all in all Simon with Latin America. And in terms of the other US things, while there's a lot of initial discussions with Dish and others, certainly the lion's share of the leasing activity this year so far I'm sure with respect to the remainder of year will come from the big four.
Simon Flannery: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Philip Cusick: Hi guys, thanks. Brendan I noticed as you talked about your guidance, you said since it's only been two months since our last guide we're going to leave it unchanged, but it sounded like there may have been a little bit of a shift in how you were thinking about it within that sort of range. Can you give us any more visibility into sort of how you think about the guidance versus where you may have seen visibility over the last couple of months? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, well, I mean that comment was specific to the organic growth component of it and while we've seen good activity and continue to see our application backlogs grow, there really hasn't been enough time go by where we could comfortably say we expect that to impact that number for 2018. So really the comment was just to kind of say, hey, it really hasn't been that long, but things are going well from an operational standpoint and so let's see how the rest of the year plays out.
Philip Cusick: That's a fair.
Jeff Stoops: Phil, I just wanted to say that's really consistent with our guidance approach of well reported as incurred and not projected.
Philip Cusick: Makes sense and then second if I can, the buyback you said was mostly in April. Was this driven by 10b5 due to the weakness in the share count or something that was under your control, weakness [ph] in the shares?
Brendan Cavanagh: Was a little bit of both actually.
Philip Cusick: Great, thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski at Barclays. Please go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski: Thank you, very much. Just doctoring on Phil's prior question in terms of thinking about the organic growth rate, if we think about sort of some of the build in activity levels that you're seeing, do you believe that that organic growth rate has room for improvement based on the activity levels that you guys are seeing at this point?
Mark DeRussy: Well, first of all to be clear when we talk about growth rates, the same tower growth rate that we report is indicative of a year-over-year, so the number that we gave for the first quarter was growth that really represented the previous trailing twelve month. So as we move forward through the year based on what's happening now, which is an increased level of leasing activity compared to where we've been over the last year, we certainly expect to see that increase sequentially as we move through the year and we would expect to exit the year at a much higher rate. But in terms of isolated to an individual quarter, we're not assuming that it gets better than where it is today, but that it continues at a similar level to where we are now, so to Jeff's earlier comment, we're not stretching out on something that we haven't seen yet get signed up.
Amir Rozwadowski: Thanks very much, Jeff. That's helpful and then going back to the deal of the day with Sprint and T-Mobile, one of the things that they did talk about it sort of a material expansion of their small cells. I believe they have decided the number of 50,000. If we think about sort of the opportunity set between some of the deployment of new spectrum versus some of the capital that will go towards small cells, how do you think about sort of the allocation or opportunity set when it comes to macro versus small cells now? Have anything really changed from your perception of the market or the opportunity set that's taking place with how these networks are going to get constructed for 5G network?
Jeff Stoops: Not really. I mean we always assume that there would be a very healthy numeric sampling of small cells out in these networks and for us it continues to be a ROIC issue, Amir.
Amir Rozwadowski: That's very helpful. That's very much for the incremental color.
Operator: And now we go to Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Thanks. I think you provided some color on amendments in [indiscernible] domestic $44 million for the year and I think it was - was it here for escalations $39 million for 2018? Are those still targets that I missed whether there was an update on that?
Jeff Stoops: They haven't changed. That's in our supplemental financial package of the bridge there of the domestic growth. Those numbers are the same. The only organic number domestically that we shifted was the churn which we actually reduced by $1 million from last quarter.
Walter Piecyk: Got it, so this churn rate that it's just you just gave it in terms of the absolute level as opposed to just saying like, okay, it's going to be a 1.5% going forward?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah. Well, in the bridge we gave an absolute dollar amount. Yeah, but we did give - given the same tower growth rates, we gave the churn rate, which is for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of the prior year was 1.5% domestically which is basically indicative of the last 12 months. So that should be generally where we are although at the end of the year there is a little bit of item churn expected that may be slightly higher, but -
Walter Piecyk: When we look at the 62 versus kind of prior growth periods, is any of that from escalations? Like is there any deviation that could have occurred in escalations in the first quarter?
Jeff Stoops: No. It is from - it does include escalations, but any variance in it is really not due to escalations. It's due to having less leasing activity in the latter part of last year. So as mentioned in the prepared comments, that's expected to increase as we move through the year because we are obviously signing up more organic business now in the first quarter and into the second quarter.
Walter Piecyk: Got you and then I think again maybe something I missed a bunch of stuff in the supplemental bridges, but I didn't see any reference to the $10 target of the FFO for 2020. Does that still hold for you guys or what's the update on that?
Jeff Stoops: That's still the goal, still the goal.
Walter Piecyk: Still the goal?
Jeff Stoops: Still the goal, we are still striving towards that. The results through the EBITDA line and with the backlogs we continue to march towards that goal, Walter.
Walter Piecyk: But there is no change. I mean it sounds like I mean I don't know, is there any change in the body language on that? I mean there is one thing to strive to something to get a goal as opposed to being like, hey, we are confident, we are going to hit this $10 in 2020?
Jeff Stoops: Well, let's go through some of the headwinds and the tailwinds there. I mean the tailwinds have been I think through the EBITDA line are going to be really, really good as we see this operational activity. From the time we first put forth the 10 by '20, probably 100 basis points higher on interest rates where we assume things and we are three multiples higher I believe on our actual stock repurchases versus our assumed. So those are the two headwinds or about where we were on FX. So ahead on operations, a little bit of headwind below the line, but all in all that's still the goal and we are still confident of getting there.
Walter Piecyk: Great, thank you very much.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question will come from Spencer Kurn at New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just have a question on long-term strategy. So as you think about laying out the next five to 10 to 15 years of growth, it looks like some of your competitors are laying their groundwork in small cells and some are developing innovation strategies. I'm just curious if - how do you think about laying a slowdown in domestic macro activity versus other sources of growth which may carry slightly lower ROIC?
Jeff Stoops: Well, we've kind of looked at that previously, Spencer, and that's what drove us to pursue international activity and that continues to be where we are today. And where our stock has traded that continues to be the preferred capital allocation in growing our FFO per share through that way is kind of our view of growth. Some folks want to see that growth on the revenue line. I continue to submit to you that the ROIC that we can produce by doing what we are doing is better and the value created for our shareholders will be better. I think our historical results have borne that out. So we will continue to do what we are doing, looking for good investment opportunities. But in terms of feeling like we have to find a new trick to grow the revenue line, we don't feel any pressure to be down at all.
Spencer Kurn: Excellent, thanks so much.
Operator: Next we will go to Jonathan Atkin at RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks, a couple of questions. I wanted to ask about the lag time between signings or executions and revenue generation on the international side. I think you gave a good domestic answer, but seeing if there's any difference in Brazil? Secondly on FirstNet and the pacing's of both signings and the pacing's of deployments, any kind of commentary on whether there has been any change this quarter versus last and specifically interested in whether you have noticed any changes in light of the Crown Castle M&A with that customer? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: I'll take the last one first. The FirstNet backlogs continue to grow. So we have - that gives us good feelings for the future. Timing is a little more difficult to predict. But the application backlogs continue to grow and that's a good sign. In terms of the international timing, I don't know that there is much difference. Is there Brendon?
Brendan Cavanagh: It's not materially different. There are times certain deals that we sign up where there are maybe more lenient commencements timeframes, but generally…
Jeff Stoops: That would be specifically negotiated.
Brendan Cavanagh: Specifically negotiated as part of maybe a larger agreement, but otherwise they are basically the same.
Jonathan Atkin: So FirstNet signings, so FirstNet deployments, nothing to speak of FirstNet signings continuing any change in the pace since mid-quarter when the M&A was good upon between Crown and AT&T?
Jeff Stoops: Not material, no.
Jonathan Atkin: And then secondly -
Jeff Stoops: That's specific - that's to the signings. Now the backlogs are continuing to grow.
Jonathan Atkin: Got it and then I think AT&T wireless, you didn't comment on that. Is that any more applicable than some of the other deals that you talked about in terms of how integration might unfold?
Jeff Stoops: I think that would be the least applicable given the almost totally similar spectrum and technologies that those two companies had.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay. And then finally on M&A multiples, any commentary on domestic multiples, international multiples that you receive in the market and any more or less competition for deals that you are seeing in, say, Brazil or Latin versus the US?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, multiples in general stay high or high, have stayed high which is why we are selective, which is why we will continue to most likely not invest all of our investible dollars in portfolio growth. And there remains a healthy bid both internationally and domestically and we feel we are, but you have to be very, very selective.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks very much.
Operator: We'll go now to David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. So two questions, I guess, Jeff, just thinking back to the Sprint network shutdown as we kind of think ahead, the potential Sprint T-Mobile combo, there were a couple of different approaches that the tower companies took. One was the American tower approach where they kind of traded off a little near-term opportunity for longer-term churn certainly and I think you guys kind of did it a little differently kind of monetize as much as you could and then you kind of took the churn paying later. It would be helpful to kind of get your reflection on your experience to that period and kind of what if any new approaches you might consider as you look ahead to a potential combination there. And then second, Brendon, just in this kind of rising rate environment, could you kind of talk through why 20% to 25% variable debt exposure is the right one? If you kind of look at the most recent financings, it seems like you got maybe a 60 basis point better financing rate on the term loan versus the fixed loan, but in a rising rate environment that's not going to last. Is there sort of circumstances that would change your view there? That would be helpful to kind of think that through. Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah. Looking back at the deal with Sprint, Dave, that was - it had many different components to which they had a term extension component. It had a network vision component. It had a LightSquared component which of course did not come to pass. It had - and then it had an iDEN churn component. So it was really the totality of all four that made that deal for us. So it's hard to say is that the right recipe going forward. There is a right recipe for sure. We've done these deals before and we would do them again. But it really is a very much of facts and circumstances type test. That was the right deal for us at that time based on those four variables and the agreements that we go through, in fact, the each –whether or not those circumstances will present themselves again. We'll see. But it's certainly something more amenable to and we would be very open too under the right circumstances.
Brendan Cavanagh: And, David, on the term loan, we have historically targeted that 20% to 25% range excluding rate debt and that is still where we are focused. But we are constantly evaluating whether or not that is the right mix. I would tell you a lot of that comes from kind of looking at the alternative. It's one thing that is to say, well, we are going to do more fixed rate debt when you have to look at what that cost of that fixed rate debt would be. In addition, there is also factors that go beyond just the interest rate which include the ability to collateralize for instance our international assets in the US here. The bank market is one of the markets that allows us to do that. And so it's a logical place for us to do a portion of our financing. Not all of our assets are well-suited for instance for the securitization market. So when we look at our different alternatives, we are looking for the most cost effective, but also the most efficient in terms of our capital structure and we'll continue to do that. And also bear in mind that we do have always the flexibility to fix some component of that floating rate debt through swaps or even through refinancing that debt because it is freely pre-payable after six months with debt from a fixed rate market if we see that as a better alternative.
David Barden: Got it and there is no absolute rate that - velocity of rate increase that's informing that decision right now?
Brendan Cavanagh: Not specifically. But obviously if they were to continue to accelerate at a fairly rapid pace that might affect the way we view it, but it also might affect our overall views on our leverage levels in totality, so all those factors would fit together.
David Barden: Alright, great, thanks guys.
Operator: Next we will go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. Two, the first one is quick. On the average remaining lease term under the Sprint leases of six years, as you noted, the term is actually 1 to 13, I'm just curious is it concentrated around six years? Is it very spread out? And then just a bigger question, it's been a long time since domestic tower construction was a primary source of your capital allocation. And there are some operators out there newer or private; you have a view that there is a considerable number of new towers that need to be constructed in the US for a range of products including 5G and others. And so I'm just curious whether you think there may be an opportunity to start putting more dollars towards that type of construction or whether the terms that are being asked for that continue to be attractive of relative to your alternatives? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I will take the last one first. I think there are going to be some opportunities. There are going to be in many cases in more rural areas which pose their own challenges, but I also do continue to believe, Brett, that there will be some terms and conditions challenges that go with that work as well.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. And, Brett, in terms of the concentration of the terms, there are some fairly well spread out. There are certain years that are more than others. I would say the bigger years are in the six and seven-year timeframe, so that's why the average kind of ends up there.
Brett Feldman: If you don't mind, I just have a follow-up question around sort of the build-to-suit. You noted in the past that because recently developers have been building towers under terms that you didn't find particularly attractive that it was also going to reduce your appetite potentially picking up these portfolios down the road, which you've done a lot of in the past in the US. I'm curious have you actually bought any of those portfolios and if so are you actually paying maniacally lower amounts or are you just finding that there aren't portfolios out there right now that look attractive to you in part because of the terms they decided to construct the towers under?
Jeff Stoops: We have had some very interesting conversations with some folks who have taken those terms and then very disappointed at the amounts of money we will prepare to pay.
Brett Feldman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next we will go to Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Great, two questions if I may. I think investors, in their accounts for that matter look at the overlap revenue as the potential risk when we see a deal like Sprint and T-Mobile now and so I'm just curious when you saw that 35000 tower decommission number that they put up, does that align with that logic or is that higher or lower than what you would have otherwise anticipated? And then also when they mentioned 85000 towers on a per forma basis going forward, you look at that compared to what Verizon or AT&T have that's meaningfully higher than where both of those companies are today, do you think that there is something unique about T-Mobile and Sprint are intending to do that would support where they need to have so many years? Do you think that that's a number ultimately that the sector itself is going to have to go towards? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: I don't know. That's a very interesting question, Colby, on your last one. The combined Sprint, T-Mobile clearly wants to make great use of the 2.5G spectrum which everybody knows doesn't promulgate thus far. So that's my layman's potential answer. But that and a nickel will get you a cup of coffee. That's - so I don't really know the answer to that or maybe it's just there more nuanced view of the capacity, intensity requirements of 4 or 5G network that others will ultimately have to get to once they get to that level of thinking. And in terms of the 35000, it would be nice to see the detail on all that and whether the - some of that consists of Clearwire and Metro and iDEN and things that everyone already has kind of thought is going away anyway. I happen to think it does, but I'm not quite sure of that myself. But at the end of the day I think this is going to be much as prior integrations have gone and decommissioning except this one has the added positive offset of knowing that every single site that remains has to have potentially significant equipment attitude to satisfy the combined company's ongoing needs.
Colby Synesael: If I could just slightly adjust the question, do you still think that us looking at the overlap revenue in this case 6% for SPA is the best way to think about the worst-case scenario in terms of ultimate churn risk from this deal?
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
Colby Synesael: Great, thanks.
Operator: And our next question will be from Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Niknam: Hi, thank you for - thanks for getting me in. Just one on 5G, I think Jeff, you may have mentioned seeing more early 5G activity in some of the rural markets. Is there any more color you can give on what's driving this and whether it's from a single carrier or across a number of carriers? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: I didn't say rural, I said, non-urban and it's basically the use of the MIMO antennas which was highlighted in the Sprint/T-Mobile call yesterday as the way to use the lower the non - given the millimeter wave spectrum a way to get to 5G. So we're starting see applications for that and so it is happening, what they actually talked about.
Matthew Niknam: Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Operator we have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly and that final question will come from Batya Levi at UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Great, thank you. I think you mentioned that you expected to grow the portfolio at the low end of the 5% to 10% range outlook that you have for the year. Is that more of a function for the multiples you see for the opportunity or leaving more room for the buyback?
Jeff Stoops: No, if that was the impression - I said, that would be as we - we're going to do at least that given how much we've already done at this point in the year. So we have the opportunity to grow the portfolio more than what the low end of the range. We will surpass the low end of the range assuming we close everything we have under contract, which I've no reason to doubt that we will. And the only thing that will hold us back Batya is what I discussed earlier about price sensitivity and getting good deals.
Batya Levi: Okay, thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: I want to thank everyone for joining us and we look forward to our next call.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by, and welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given to you at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Also, as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your Vice President of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2018 and beyond. In today's press release, and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 26, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn it over to Brendan to comment on our fourth quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA ended the year with another strong quarter. We again had another steady operational performance in our leasing business, as well as a positive contribution from our services business. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $414.1 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $410.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our estimates for the fourth quarter which we previously provided with our third quarter earnings release. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 5% over the fourth quarter of 2016, including the impact of 2.1% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 7.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.6% on a gross basis, and 4.1% on a net basis, including 2.5% of churn, 73% of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 9.9%, including 70 basis points of churn or 10.6% on a gross basis. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 12%. Domestic operational leasing activity representing new revenue signed up during the quarter, was a little lighter than expected as a couple of U.S. carriers were preparing for big deployment initiatives which have since commenced. Our services business benefited from those preparations in the fourth quarter in the form of site audits and other advanced work. Newly signed up domestic leasing revenue came about two-thirds from amendments, and one-third from new leases, and the big four carriers represented 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was added during the quarter. While our somewhat modest domestic leasing activity during the fourth quarter in terms of signings will have some impact on projected revenue growth during the first half of 2018, our domestic leasing application backlog saw, and continues to see meaningful growth which bodes well for sequential growth throughout 2018. International leasing activity was very good in the fourth quarter and increased from the third quarter. We again saw positive contributions from all of our markets, with Brazil and Panama in particular delivering very strong results. During the fourth quarter, 86.1% of cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.7% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 9% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. With regard to fourth quarter churn, we continue to see churn from leases with Metro/Leap and Clearwire consistent with our expectations. As of December 31st, we have approximately $18 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with Metro/Leap and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next two to three years. We have reduced that number due to the actual lease terminations that have occurred, but also in part due to revised expectations for less churn than originally anticipated, due to indication that some of these leases will be kept and upgraded. Domestic churn in the fourth quarter from all other tenants on an annual same-tower basis was 66 basis points. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $327 million. We continue to effectively manage the direct cost associated with our towers, allowing us to continue to produce industry-leading operating margins. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 82.4% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 68.2% and 89.8% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $310.1 million. Our adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were due to solid results from both our leasing and services businesses. Services revenues in the fourth quarter were $29 million, up 26.6% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Cash SG&A for the quarter was better than expectations due to solid cost control as well as some reductions in legal and other reserves, and it continues to decline as a percentage of total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.6% in the quarter compared to 70% in the year earlier period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.1%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. AFFO in the fourth quarter was $211.8 million. Our AFFO per share increased 9.2% to $1.78. AFFO was negatively affected during the quarter by approximately $1 million of non-discretionary CapEx associated with hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and an additional $0.5 million associated with tax expense reported in connection with a new tax law passed in December. These taxes related to state tax exposures around foreign accumulated E&P in states where we do not have any NOLs. In addition to our positive fourth quarter financial results, we also had a successful quarter with regard to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we acquired 989 communication sites for $250.2 million, including 941 sites located in Brazil. We also built 176 sites during the fourth quarter. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have acquired 308 additional communication sites at an aggregate purchase price of $79.5 million. As of today, we also have 1,038 additional sites under contract for acquisition at an aggregate price of $308.5 million. 811 of these additional sites under contract are located in El Salvador and are to be purchased from a local subsidiary of Millicom International. We anticipate these sites will close in several tranches throughout the second half of 2018. The Millicom transaction will increase SBAs position as the largest tower company in El Salvador, a country where we have been in for almost eight years and where all of our tenant lease contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, as well as expanding our relationship with Millicom, a leading wireless carrier in several of our markets. We continue to look for opportunities to add quality assets in markets where we are comfortable operating and can leverage our existing scale and platform to maximize returns. We also continue to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $19.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. Beyond portfolio investments, we also invested in significant share repurchases during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we spent $311.1 million to repurchase 1.9 million shares at an average price of $160.15 per share. Our total 2017 share repurchases were $850 million for 5.8 million shares represented an average price of $146.17 per share. Share repurchases remain an important contributor to our efforts to continually grow AFFO per share. Looking ahead now, our earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full-year 2018. Our outlook reflects anticipated growth in both our leasing and services businesses. We anticipate a meaningful increase in domestic operational leasing activity in 2018 over 2017, driven largely by incremental activity from Sprint, and the ramp up of FirstNet related activity with AT&T. Combined with steady contributions from T-Mobile and Verizon, we expect to see domestic leasing activity in the form of new lease and amendment signings build throughout the year which should begin to show itself in the financial results in the second half of the year. We expect that this increased domestic leasing activity will result in a very positive run rate leasing revenue level by year-end. We have also assumed a decline in year-over-year domestic churn levels by about one-third. In our international business, our outlook anticipates continued steady organic leasing contributions, as well as incremental contributions from the sites acquired over the last couple of months, and those under contract expected to be closed later this year, offset in part, by a lower contribution from tenant escalators in Brazil due to the decline in the Brazilian CPI rate. We have forecasted a slight weakening in the Brazilian foreign exchange rate in 2018 with a blended average FX rate during 2018 of 3.33 Brazilian Reais to 1 U.S. Dollar. The exchange rate is assumed to weaken throughout the year. Our full-year 2018 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today and it does not assume any share repurchases at all. We have incorporated the interest costs of our recently priced securitization offering, but we have not assumed any additional financing activity throughout the rest of the year. We have also assumed a slightly increasing LIBOR rate throughout the year, impacting our floating rate debt. Our non-discretionary cash capital expenditures include $3.5 million of estimated CapEx associated with repairs due to hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. We estimate an increase in our cash taxes of approximately $3 million to $4 million at the mid-point mostly related to state taxes where we do not have any NOLs and increases in our international taxes. Our tax assumptions take into account the minor implications we anticipate in connection with the new tax legislation passed in December. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of 118.4 million which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We are excited and optimistic about 2018. For the first time in years, all four of the major U.S. wireless carriers are actively investing in their networks, creating great opportunities for SBA to continue reporting increasing growth and solid financial results. With that, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the year with $9.3 billion of net debt and our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.5 times, at the high-end of our targeted range of 7 to 7.5 times. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.7 times. We ended the year with $40 million outstanding under our $1 billion revolver and have $75 million outstanding as of today. On October 13th, we issued $750 million of unsecured senior notes. These notes bear interest at a rate of 4% per year payable semi-annually and mature on October 1, 2022. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay $460 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. On February 16, we agreed through our Tower Trust to issue $640 million of secured tower revenue securities at a fixed interest rate of 3.448% payable monthly. This offering is expected to close March 9, 2018, and the securities are expected to have an anticipated repayment date in March 2023, and a final maturity date in March 2048. The proceeds of this offering, in combination with borrowings under the revolving credit facility, will be used to repay in full our 2013-1C and 2013-1D Tower securities. Pro forma for this transaction the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.7% and our weighted average maturity is approximately 4.4 years. As Brendan mentioned earlier, during 2017, we repurchased 5.8 million shares of common stock for $850 million, at an average price per share of $146.17, leaving us with $150 million of authorization remaining under our stock repurchase program. On February 16th, our Board of Directors approved the authorization of a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan replacing the prior plan. This new plan authorizes the company to purchase from time-to-time our outstanding stock through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10B-18 and/or in privately negotiated transactions at management's discretion. Shares repurchased under the plan will be retired and the plan has no time deadline. As of today, the full $1 billion is available on in the plan. The company shares outstanding at December 31st, 2017, are 116.4 million, down from 121 million at year-end 2016. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening everyone. As you heard from Brendan earlier, we had another good quarter, and overall a really good 2017. Throughout the year, we were able to deliver solid financial results exceeding our expectations and our initial guidance. We also continued to grow our portfolio and shrink our share counts through balanced capital allocation. We created value on many fronts in 2017 rather from growth in AFFO per share, growth in return on invested capital to levels well above our cost of capital, or material gains in our share price. We're well positioned for 2018 and beyond. In the U.S., current operational customer activity is the highlight. All four major U.S. wireless carriers are active for the first time in years. Although in early stages this activity has driven our domestic leasing backlog to a multi-year high. During the fourth quarter, we signed a master lease agreement with Sprint which commits them to amendment and co-location activity over the next year-and-a-half, while also extending out the current term on thousands of their existing lease agreements. In addition, FirstNet activity and amendments have commenced. Since our last earnings call, all 50 states formally opted into FirstNet and AT&T began submitting amendment applications incorporating FirstNet needs. We expect to see this activity increase as we move through 2018. Internationally, we also had a very good finish to the year. Our fourth quarter international operational leasing activity was the best of the year, including another very strong quarter in Brazil. Our international leasing activity increased sequentially each quarter during 2017, giving us great confidence for this portion of our business heading into 2018. The international activity this quarter came about 60% from amendments, and 40% from newly leases, and FX rates came in generally in line with our estimates heading into the quarter. Our execution across the organization continues to be excellent, with continued 80% tower cash flow margins and 70% adjusted EBITDA margins, notwithstanding the steady addition of a material amount of new less mature lower margin sites to the portfolio. We grew our portfolio 6.5% during 2017 within our target range of 5% to 10%. Based on our sites acquired thus far in 2018, and those that we have under contract, we believe, we are in good shape to meet our 5% to 10% portfolio growth goals again this year. During the fourth quarter, we closed on the addition of over 900 sites in Brazil. These sites are high quality, immature sites, with the majority of revenues coming from TIM and Vivo; only 2% of the revenue in this portfolio come from Oi, giving us a nice revenue diversification there. We continue to perform well in Brazil and anticipate that these new sites will complement the lease-up success we've had on our existing portfolio in Brazil. The decline in inflation and the stabilization of the currency, as well as the formal approval of Oi's traditional reorganization plan, all provide a backdrop in Brazil which bodes well for continued growth for SBA. In addition to Brazil, we have continued to expand our presence in several of our other markets. In January, we closed on the addition of over 250 sites across Peru and Colombia. And in February, we entered into an agreement to purchase over 800 sites in El Salvador to Millicom. We're particularly pleased with the Millicom transaction as it expands our dominant position in El Salvador as the number one tower company, and adds incremental U.S. dollar denominated revenues to our overall portfolio. Heading into 2018, we continue to believe that we are on track to achieve our goal of $10 or more of AFFO per share by 2020. Throughout 2017, we stay exactly within our net debt target range of 7.0 to 7.5 times and we apply a very balanced approach to capital allocation with a healthy mix of asset additions and share repurchases. In 2018, we expect more of the same. As demonstrated by the success of our recently priced securitization refinancing, we continue to have strong access to capital. Our securitization was priced at a spread of 85 basis points over treasuries, representing lowest spread to treasuries for any five-year single A rated tower issuance since the financial crisis in 2008. So even in the rising interest rate environment, we continue to be a favorite issuer in all of the markets in which we issue debt. We have great access to capital and routinely price at the tight end of comparably rated securities. The tower business continues to be extremely attractive and we're pleased to be a leader in our industry. In 2017, we saw steady activity across all of our markets and we executed extremely well. We were able to grow our portfolio, shrink our outstanding share count, manage our financing costs, and expand our already industry-leading operating margins. We created additional value for our shareholders. The growing activity levels of our customers and associated growth in our leasing backlogs give us optimism for continued solid performance in 2018 and beyond. I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their contributions to our success and I look forward to sharing with you our results throughout the year. With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Hey couple of questions on the guidance if I could. So Jeff and Brendan, I think you mentioned that you're seeing FirstNet activity and lease amendments, can you help us understand is FirstNet in guidance ramping through the year and not in guidance, just trying to gauge I know you don't like to call out individual customers, but obviously it's a big project, so I'm just trying to gauge what you've kind of baked into that from a FirstNet standpoint and do you expect to sign an MLA with AT&T and FirstNet?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Ric, we have included some impact from FirstNet in our guidance because as we mentioned we've seen some actual executions of amendments already that obviously influence the amount that we're expecting to report during 2018. We also have some FirstNet amendment applications in our backlog that have influenced our expectations. But it is expected to build throughout the year, and I think that you'll see the majority of that impact towards the latter part of the year and into next year.
Ric Prentiss: And about, as far as thinking about an MLA with AT&T, I know in the past you haven’t done a lot of them but it sounded like you might have done one with Sprint, I think, I heard Jeff, say.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, we did do one with Sprint, Ric. We have done -- we did one previously with Sprint, we've done one with T-Mobile. So it's certainly not out of the question. But as to whether we will or not I would just kind of leave that one alone and we'll see what happens. I mean we're not religiously or fundamentally opposed to it, it just has to be the right deal for both parties.
Ric Prentiss: Yes, that makes sense. But it sounds like Sprint MLA done, so that's kind of maybe fully in guidance then with Sprint side?
Brendan Cavanagh: It's in to the extent that there are specifics but there is the commitment is over a period of time to sign up a certain amount of business, but the timing of that is not absolute. So depending on how that flows in it could be different than what we've assumed.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, it's a multi-year agreement that isn't really granular in terms of quarterly commitments. It's more of commitments over the whole term of the agreement. So to Brendan's point it will depend really on timing.
Ric Prentiss: Fair. So certainly there could be upside to both those customers getting more active, but there is some in guidance; is that fair?
Brendan Cavanagh: Fair.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. And then a lot of us are all still trying to figure out FirstNet, is it going to be mostly co-locations, mostly amendment activity, what are you kind of seeing so far from AT&T and what the nature of FirstNet touch might look like, with the one client FirstNet plus AWS-3 and WCS?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. So far for us, it's mostly amendment and it's a wide range of equipment needs because now AT&T has a very wide range of existing equipment loads throughout its network. So I really can't generalize and say, it's, three radios, three antennas, six radios, six antennas, it’s really very much diverse across the board. But in our case, it looks like it’s going to be primarily amendment.
Ric Prentiss: Okay. And last one from me they're all kind of inter-related, I think you mentioned the acquired network churn has gotten better maybe domestic churn down a third year-over-year and some of the acquired network churn maybe not going to occur, was that baked into the MLAs or just trying to think how you got notification of that from the carriers?
Brendan Cavanagh: No, not directly baked into the MLAs. We were -- as we gave you a number each quarter as to what we saw the total potential impact from Metro/Leap and Clearwire specifically, some of that was based on our estimates and our view on which sites they would be keeping and which ones they wouldn't be. And as we've gotten renewal notices on some of those or they haven't terminated them, as renewal dates have come up, that's obviously affected it. And then to some degree on the Clearwire there was a little bit within the MLA where we saw certain sites being upgraded that we previously thought might go away so a little bit of that. But most of it was just leases being renewed that we would have otherwise expected to be churned off.
Ric Prentiss: It makes sense. Thanks for all the transparency and details. Thanks guys.
Jeff Stoops: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Hi, this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to get a little more clarification on the Sprint MLA, was the contract, what is the current contract length before the MLA and kind of what is that now? And then in terms of I guess you alluded to earlier that the amount of activity could drive higher numbers, kind of given the -- where the guidance was, we would expect it a little bit higher of a potential number, how can that change given the activity levels?
Jeff Stoops: Well, there was, no, MLA with Sprint previously. So every -- all the leases with Sprint were on their own terms which, I think averaged --
Brendan Cavanagh: We had about four years. I mean there was the old MLA that we did a few years ago that had extended some terms --
Jeff Stoops: Had some carryover impact.
Brendan Cavanagh: But each one had its own term end dates to Jeff's point, yes.
Jeff Stoops: So this does not apply to all of our Sprint leases, it applies to a substantial and we're not going to give you total granularity on this because we're not supposed to per our agreement with Sprint. But we do have for the leases that this does apply to we have multi-year extended terms and there are certain amendment 2.5 commitments and also new co-lo commitments over a period of time that Sprint has agreed to. So by the end of the agreement, there will be a certain amount of business that they will have obligated themselves to and that can all be accelerated by when they actually agree to do that, but by the end of the agreement we know that it will be there because that is the drop dead date on the obligation.
Richard Choe: And then in terms of the organic growth 4.1% in 4Q 2017, ex-churn 6.6%, how should we think about -- how that ramps through the year in terms of actual activity versus churn kind of coming down and the non-acquired nor churn is continues to kind of ramp down so given there's like three pieces, how should we think about it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, it just as a refresher on that number first it is a -- it is really representative of the trailing 12-months activity because you're comparing the fourth quarter in this case to the fourth quarter of 2016. So everything that happened in between their impacts it. And so as we start to move into the first part of the year, the influence of what occurred during 2017 also is kind of carried with these first few quarters. But we would expect by the end of the year to see that number increase based on our expectations, based on the backlog that we talked about, building we expect to see a lot more of lease-up taking place, so by the time we get towards the end of the year that that number will be higher in terms of the gross leasing number. On the churn piece, we do expect that to continue to step-down. We have a small amount of iDern churn in the fourth quarter of next year that may impact the fourth quarter, but we do expect to be otherwise below 2% on our same tower churn numbers, primarily due to a drop off in the consolidation related churn.
Richard Choe: But still with a chunk of that left?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, still some left.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey thanks for taking my question. So obviously you can't talk to the specifics of the Sprint deal, I guess more generally speaking, can you walk us through your current thinking regarding what adds from a carrier would make a proposed MLA unacceptable and what sort of price or protections would have to be included to make it palatable and something you'd be willing to sign, because historically you've been more cautious on this front than some of your peers I just want to understand, kind of where you are?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I mean there are a lot of different puts and takes, Nick, but the single most or at least the one point that the agreements that we have willing to enter into have all shared is equipment specificity.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. So safe to assume --
Jeff Stoops: It's all -- all the equipment entitlements are all laid out very clearly that's the one constant in the now three master leases that the SBA has entered into.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, got it. Maybe one on inflation because that's been a topic du jour, with long-term contracts and fixed escalators it's worked well with inflation at subdued levels, but could introduce some issues of inflation rose to levels above where it's been or what was contemplated when the standard kind of 3% escalator was set. So can you talk about some of the tools or strategies you could employ to help offset some of those issues, if we do see inflation meaningfully higher than where it stands today?
Jeff Stoops: Well, if we see, inflation meaningfully higher, I think the vast majority of the likely reason will be greatly improved economy which we believe would translate into improved spending, a better consumer. And that's all going to help us on the organic growth side. Obviously we're going to have pricing ability on any type of new asset on any type of amendment. One of the benefits of the way we do business is we don't have any agreements in place now. But for this one with Sprint which was somewhat limited in its application. So we do have kind of cart launch ability to price new types of activity. Where we would continue to be limited is on the renewal where the agreements do are dictated by the existing escalator in place. So we turn our attentions towards managing more on the expense side and dealing with things potentially on the financing side to manage all that. But I --
Brendan Cavanagh: And just maybe one thing to add is that that our expense base is largely fixed. The majority of our expenses are also tied to fixed escalators, that's our ground leases and obviously given our large margins there's a limited expense base. So we won't see kind of an increase in our operating expenses at a time when we're not able to increase our revenue base at a similar rate.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. So just understand your guidance for new leasing activity, looks like you're guiding to $44 million in 2018 which is just modestly up from the $42 million you reported in 2017? I envision your comments about things picking up during the year is it the case just look thinking about the slope of that, revenue that we could actually see new leasing revenue decline a little bit in the first half of the year, then ramping sharply in the back half, or would you expect it to be sort of slow and steadily increasing.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I think we would expect it to be steadily increasing throughout the year. We're not expecting like material drops. And the reality is it's not that volatile the activity levels and so as we continue to see our backlogs increase we would expect to see our leasing revenue also increase. So I think it will be relatively flat here in the first part of the year based on modest activity in the second half of 2017 and then starting to increase in the back half of the year.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I mean let's be clear you said material we're not expecting any drops.
Brendan Cavanagh: No.
Jeff Stoops: We're not expecting any drops in revenue, Spencer.
Spencer Kurn: Got it. Thanks. And then just one more if I may, looks like at the mid-point of your guidance for AFFO per share you're forecasting growth of about 7.5% in 2018; is and then to meet your $10 per share target by 2020, you've got to assume, you can grow at about 15% a year for the next two years after that; is that the real trajectory we should be expecting for the next three years or is it likely the case that you'll do capital, you'll repurchase shares or buy assets throughout the year such that that sort of a trajectory from AFFO per share in 2017 to 2020 is a lot smoother.
Jeff Stoops: We have, always, I think been very clear that we intend to stay through this path to $10 or more of AFFO per share fully invested to our target leverage ranges of 7 to 7.5 times. And if you look at our guidance, and you run those numbers out, you'll see that we need to invest more capital to do that. And we've also, I think been very clear that additional stock repurchases are very large component of getting to that $10 or more of AFFO per share. So we intend do some more capital allocation expenses.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jeff Stoops: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Feldman: Thanks. And hopefully this is the last Sprint MLA question is just a point of clarification but it does look like your mix of revenue from Sprint was higher in the quarter than we've seen in a long time and you also have an increase in straight line revenues projected for this year is that all related to Sprint MLA or just something else going on that we need to understand.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, that's all related to the Sprint MLA.
Brett Feldman: Okay. And then just maybe stepping back a bigger picture question, we always get the question on towers versus small cells and I think the way you framed it in the past is that where you really covered is site exclusivity and we've seen some other operators who have a similar philosophy maybe do a bit more deals in those spaces and I'm curious as you look at the way, wireless infrastructure is evolving, are you starting to see other infrastructure solutions maybe more small cell opportunities or otherwise they're actually capturing some of that site exclusivity you look for, you may actually look to more of it, are you still very comfortable that your traditional tower leasing business domestically and internationally is going to consume the vast majority of whatever incremental capital you put into infrastructure?
Jeff Stoops: I think the macro business will consume the vast majority, Brett. But clearly there are real estate opportunities that will be small cell oriented that are exclusive in nature that are definitely worth pursuing and those are the ones that we are looking at and looking for and actually have with you.
Brett Feldman: Is there anything from your conversations with carriers about all these massive projects that they're beginning to ramp that has maybe made it more clear where those opportunities are?
Jeff Stoops: The things that we're looking for tend to be more one-off and more very asset specific and not really suitable for competitive bid. I think by nature you don't have an exclusive asset, that's how it's created. So there's a vast variety of different assets out there that are going to come into play here and some of them are going to be good. And actually, we do have a few, I mean we haven't really talked a whole lot about it, because it's not very material at all, but we are doing exactly some of that business where we think it's a very exclusive asset.
Brett Feldman: Great. Thank you for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski: Thanks very much and good afternoon folks. A couple of questions if I may, in thinking about some of the commentary that have come out of the carriers more recently about using alternative sites either public infrastructure for sites or potentially using other tower providers or building certain sites like AT&T and Verizon they talked about. Have you seen any changes when it comes to their behavior, when it comes to looking to upgrade their sites? And then -- what -- another question on sort of the Sprint side, I appreciate that you can't provide necessarily all the full details, but has there been any change to the escalator structure that you guys have seen historically any color on those lines would be very helpful.
Jeff Stoops: No change on the escalator, Amir. And on the other, no real changes that in any material way impact our business. I do think over time that our customers in their never-ending quest for different cheaper lower options, may find the occasional alternative here or there, but I really don't think it will ever prove to be anything material, and I think it will always be subsumed within our, what we believe will be ever shrinking churn assumptions.
Amir Rozwadowski: That's very helpful. And one last one, if I may, I mean, if we think about sort of your capital allocation strategy, and then your goal for long-term AFFO, it does sound like, the way we should be thinking about things is really leaning more towards the share buyback versus M&A is that the appropriate assumption that we should be making.
Jeff Stoops: Not necessarily. I mean if you look at what we've done over really just since our last earnings, you can see a heavy bias of capital allocation towards M&A. It's really very opportunistic in where we see the greatest opportunity for long-term value creation. There was a period of time where we saw that in share repurchases. The last time where we saw that in share repurchases, the last four, six months or so we've seen that in M&A. So I really can't give you one-way or the other there. But what I can tell you is that we do intend to stay leveraged absent some huge jump beyond, well beyond where we are today in interest rates. We do intend to stay levered in the 7 to 7.5 times range and use that investment capital for either M&A or share repurchases and we continue to have the bias towards M&A where we could find the right opportunities.
Amir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much for the incremental color.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.
Batya Levi: Great, thank you. Just couple of follow-ups. First, domestically does the guide assume any activity from DISH at this point? And on international, it looked like churn picked up slightly is there anything to point out there and how do the recent acquisitions internationally compared to your existing portfolios in terms of tenancy churn? And finally again looking at other opportunities to acquire portfolios, do you see any change in the level of activity from competitors maybe valuation of these assets? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: First question was about DISH in guidance, there's nothing specific in there related to DISH at this point. The international churn was related to primarily one unique situation in Latin America, one customer that is not going to repeat itself.
Brendan Cavanagh: Small, small customer.
Jeff Stoops: Small customer and actually could get worked out and we defer not to name it at this point. The M&A market continues to be very competitive. We stop and we start and we're opportunistic around our capital allocation because it is very competitive and I don't think that's going to change, given the desirability of high quality tower assets. But there are good opportunities out there. We're pretty good at ferreting them out and we will continue to look to do that, but it is competitive. Now I think you had one more question and I --
Batya Levi: No, just in terms of the recent international acquisitions, if the -- if that portfolio is any different than what you have in LatAm right now?
Jeff Stoops: Well the highline deal in Brazil low maturity, good revenues skewed towards TIM and Vivo, high quality towers. So that is a little different characteristics from our Oi concentration in Brazil, gives us a nice diversification which was one of the leading attractions there. Then the Millicom deal which we just did was really a little bit different again, very immature towers, we had somewhat of a structured transaction where we arrived at a price based on the rent that we agreed that Millicom would pay. We arrived at what we thought was very attractive price per tower given that market and we know that market very well because we were already the leading tower company in that market. But high quality towers, Millicom, is the leading provider in that market. So we know we're getting very good locations and it should be good opportunities for the other three players in that market to co-locate. So every one of those deals has a little bit of a different twist and turn and that all has to play into the analysis and decision making.
Batya Levi: Okay. And is the focus though mainly in Americas or would you look to expand outside of that region?
Jeff Stoops: There continues to be -- we continue to be primarily a western hemisphere focused company but we will look in other areas and we will see good opportunity and good value creation where it presents itself.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hey guys, thanks so much. Brendan, I think you mentioned the assumptions that you're making on higher international taxes, and then, also assumption on kind of what's going to happen to LIBOR. I think those two things are kind of grinding in the AFFO growth I think relative to the improved Telecom Services growth. Could you give us a little bit more color on kind of what you're baking in numerically into that outlook could be super helpful. And then, just kind of following up on something we were talking about earlier, I think in the script again, Brendan, you had something to the effect that the higher stock price makes you think harder about the buybacks, obviously there's a mathematical equation in there, but I was wondering if just because the stock has done so well, does that make the underlying M&A transactions that much more attractive use of capital relative to buybacks at the margin? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. So on the tax assumption, we -- it's actually in our press release if you look at kind of the walk down of guidance it's in the back for each of the specific items, it shows a range of $17.5 million to $22.5 million, so $20 million at the mid-point, that's for total taxes and that's up $3 million to $4 million. I mentioned international specifically and that's just really because as we get bigger internationally we generate more taxable income. So that's part of the reason that that moves up. On the LIBOR assumptions, we are assuming an increase in LIBOR, but it's somewhat modest, it's about 25 to 30 basis point move up throughout somewhat evenly throughout the year, so it's moved a little more dramatically than that in the early part of the year. So we'll see whether that assumption holds or not but that is the assumption. And then your other question was the M&A versus the stock buybacks and certainly as the stock becomes more expensive, I mean really what we're doing here is we're making decisions as to how best to allocate capital and trying to get the best return possible. So we're looking at all of our options in front of us, if the return on the stock buybacks isn't as great as it was before relative to the M&A opportunities before us that may mean more M&A. But I think if you look at the last couple of years, you've seen us do a pretty good mix of both and I would expect that to be the case going forward.
Jeff Stoops: I would just add to that, Dave, that for any M&A deal, you have to hit the minimum investment requirement, and then, it was only after that that you really had the choice between stock repurchases and M&A. So once you hit that minimum certainly the increased stock price allows for a potentially greater bias towards those M&A opportunities that otherwise qualify.
David Barden: Thanks for that, Jeff. I appreciate it. Brendan, could I just do one quick follow-up on the just a general exposure to the variable rate debt at the margin; is there anything about kind of the rate environment what you're looking at happening that makes you want to fix that in the swap market or even through a re-fi?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I mean it's something that we're evaluating all the time and I think there are opportunities to do some things, but we'll just stay posted, and we'll do what we can to minimize those costs always.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Hi thanks, two if I could. One, could you just review for us which acquisitions are in the revenue guide for 2018 and what might be pending that's not in that acquisition contribution number? And then, secondly, if you look at the opportunities, you mentioned Sprint, FirstNet, can you talk about what peak site leasing growth could look like over the next few years?
Brendan Cavanagh: On the M&A question obviously everything that we've closed to-date is clearly in, so the highline deal, the deal that we mentioned that was in Peru and Colombia those are of course in. And then, everything that's under contract, we also included, but there is some variability to that because we've had to make certain assumptions around timing of when those might close. So in the case of the biggest item which is the Millicom deal in El Salvador we have included that in our guidance, and that's why our discretionary CapEx is where it is, and we've made certain assumptions around closing of that in tranches throughout the second half of 2018. But the timing on that could shift earlier or later and would have some slight impact on that, but anything that's not signed up under contract is not, there's nothing included.
Jeff Stoops: On your second question, Mike, we haven't really kind of reduced that to a quantifiable number, but I would say your peak potential would be materially higher than certainly what we are expecting in 2018, and way, way, way higher than what is currently in our guidance.
Michael Rollins: And maybe a question that you talked about in the past, you just talked about the exit rate in the fourth quarter of where you expect site leasing to get to based on your annual guidance and your comment for some of the backend loading of leasing can you level set what that fourth quarter to fourth quarter organic growth might look like for the company.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I'd rather not give a specific number but I will say that we expect it to be higher on average than the average growth rate that we would assume for the full-year, because we do expect it to grow throughout the year, sequentially. So we definitely would expect to be leaving the year with a higher rate than the average that we've implied here for the full-year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman: Yes, thanks for taking my question. As I look at the organic, domestic gross organic growth rate, it looks pretty flat year-over-year, right out of the gate and it includes as you said some activity from Sprint and FirstNet. And I was just wondering would -- the other activity that had been driving prior LTE capacity upgrade, the AWS-3 overlays, has that stuff remained constant or slowed down because it seems to be displaced with the other stuff in there. And on a -- on the churn basis, it seems like significant improvement in churn year-over-year I didn't catch how much of that is, of your churn assumption is consolidation versus non-consolidation in 2018?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, well part of the -- and I think part of the issue that we're trying to be, to carefully make sure people understand here is the difference between operating leasing activity where people sign up things, but then when it hits the financial statements which typically is six months later. So while things are happening now and we've included some of that it's not going to be in the financial statements until the second half and that's what's contributing to the 2018 number. So things are operationally really good now and we think going to get even better, but you're not going to begin to really see the financial impact of that. That when you combine that with what was a slower fourth quarter, because a couple of these carriers were getting ready for this activity that we're now talking about that does have an impact in the 2018 financial time period. So that's really the -- you combine all that stuff together and that is what has produced the guidance that we've put forward at this time. You want to further?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, the churn in 2018, basically half of that is associated with Metro/Leap and Clearwire consolidation. So it's about 2% of the assumption for full-year over full-year about 1% of that is from those guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Niknam: Hey guys. Thank you for getting me in. Just two quick ones if I could. One, on the domestic activity, I just want to be clear you mentioned some of the lighter activity during 4Q, was this from one carrier or several and is it fair to assume that has all sort of shown up year-to-date or is there some of that that may have not I guess surfaced in the first two months of the year and maybe driving some of the slower revenue growth early on in 2018? And then, secondly just a follow-up on Brett's earlier question, one of your peers is actually investing in fiber in some international markets and maybe complementing the macro business is this something you may consider in some of your LatAm markets just given the sort of the different supply dynamics of fiber in some of these markets relative to the U.S. Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, on the latter question, we're watching those opportunities and we're certainly open-minded to see if we believe that there can be better return on invested capital in those markets or any market as opposed to the conclusions that we've reached in the United States. Brendan?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, on the first question, the activity, as Jeff mentioned, was a little bit lower in the fourth quarter. We have seen it increase as we've come into this year. So the first few months our actual activity which we're describing as applications coming in and signings of new agreements has definitely picked up, but the timing of that, the influence through the financials of course will be delayed. So I think the first quarter definitely is impacted or is expected to be impacted a little bit in terms of revenue recognition by the slower executions in the fourth quarter. But again based on what's happening now in terms of signings, we feel good that as we get into the latter half of the year that will see some positive uptick there.
Matthew Niknam: And Brendan just if I could just follow-up was that one specific carrier or is this just a broader phenomenon on the quarter across the industry.
Brendan Cavanagh: No, we said in our comments, it was a couple.
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Hi, great thank you. Just regarding Oi which you called out in the press release noting you thought what's going on there could be positive, just wondering, if you could kind of break that down a little bit further in terms of what might happen as a result of that or is this kind of more just about getting better clarity? And then secondly as it relates to excess capital I haven't done the math, I was hoping you could help me out. When you look at the committed M&A that you've already done for this year, for 2018, any sense of how you could frame up what's left over for either additional M&A or potential buyback. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Well the Oi approval has set out certain terms which require a certain number of bond holders to convert and there's a certain amount of equity that needs to commence, so there's certain things probably that still needs to happen for everything to come out and Oi to resume operations kind of totally outside of the plan. But to have gotten this far and have a plan that is now out there and actionable and people are working on it is certainly a tremendous success and a step in the right direction. In terms of how much is left on the -- I mean that we can -- why don't we offline kind of help you figure out going back to triangulate back into 7 to 7.5 times EBITDA because that's going to get back to where, how much remaining investment capacity is left.
Operator: Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Amy Yong: Thanks. Thank you for squeezing me in. And I guess if you could talk broadly on all the different brands of spectrum that's getting deployed 600 2.5, can you talk through at what point we're at for the 600 and how does that change kind of the equipment or the actual pricing structure? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, we're still in the relatively early innings for the 600, because there's still a fair amount of clearing that has to occur and the equipment is different, generally larger antennas in every instance new radios so that is always going to at least the way we structure our contracts is going to require an amendment where we have additional revenue opportunities. Now depending on how many radios and how many antennas, Amy, that's going to obviously dictate the final pricing, but it is going to be an opportunity, a revenue opportunity for us in every case where our towers are hit and I do believe we are in the early innings. It was a fair amount of progress made early on. I had to get T-Mobile a lot of credit. They're extremely -- they're all over this, they're working, they have a great plan. They're working hard. They execute extremely well, but there's still a lot of stuff that has to be done on the clearance side for them to get to the rest of it.
Amy Yong: Got it. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Thank you. And, Operator, that's all for us and I'd like to tell everybody thanks for joining us and we look forward to our next call.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA 2017 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2017 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, October 30, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn the call over to Brendan to comment on our third quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks, Mark. Good evening. The third quarter was another good one for SBA. We had steady operational performance on the leasing side of our business as well as a solid contribution from our services business. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $408.5 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $404.2 million. Better-than-expected foreign exchange rate positively impacted leasing revenue by approximately $1.6 million relative to the company's prior expectations for the third quarter. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.8% over the third quarter of 2016. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 7.4%. The net same-tower growth calculation was negatively impacted by approximately 2.6% of churn. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 6.9% on a gross basis and 3.9% on a net basis, including 3% of churn, over 70% of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, gross same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 10.6%, exclusive of 50 basis points of churn. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 11.5%. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue signed up during the quarter, was stable and in line with expectations. Newly signed up domestic leasing revenue came almost equally from new leases and amendments, and the big 4 carriers represented 92% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue added during the quarter. International leasing activity increased modestly from the second quarter, and we continue to see solid contributions from all of our markets. Brazil in particular had a very solid leasing quarter, giving us continued confidence in the long-term prospects for that market and the opportunity to see very positive returns on our investment there.  During the third quarter, 86.1% of cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.8% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.0% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. With regard to third quarter churn, we continue to see churn from leases with Metro/Leap and Clearwire consistent with our expectations. As of September 30, we have approximately $28 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with Metro/Leap and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next 2 to 3 years. That's down from $50 million at September 30, 2016. Domestic churn in the third quarter from all other tenants on an annual same-tower basis was 0.8%. We continue to expect domestic same-tower churn rates to be in the mid-2% range by the end of the year. Our expectation for total churn is unchanged and is factored into our long-term goal of producing $10 or more of AFFO per share by 2020. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $321.5 million. Better-than-expected foreign exchange rates positively impacted tower cash flow by approximately $1 million relative to prior expectations. We continue to have success controlling the direct costs associated with our towers, allowing us to continue to have the strongest operating margins in the industry. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 82.2% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 68.3% and 90.1%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $303.1 million. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $0.9 million relative to our expectations. Our adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were due to solid results from both our leasing and services businesses. Services revenues in the third quarter were $25.4 million, up 9.5% over the third quarter of 2016. And cash SG&A for the quarter was generally in line with expectations but continues to decline as a percentage of total revenue, demonstrating the tremendous scalability of the tower model. We anticipate modest increases in SG&A in connection with continued international expansion but otherwise expect to continue to leverage our existing back-office structure to drive additional value from our organic top line growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.6% in the quarter compared to 70.1% in the year-earlier period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.1%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. AFFO in the third quarter was $211.3 million, which amount was positively impacted by approximately $0.8 million relative to prior expectations due to stronger foreign exchange rates. Our AFFO per share increased 14.4% to $1.75. In our drive toward continual growth in AFFO per share, a primary focus for management is the optimum allocation of capital. To that end, we had a very productive third quarter and beginning to the fourth quarter. As we've indicated in the past, our preferred use of capital is toward quality new assets followed by share repurchases. We anticipate a healthy mix of both portfolio investment and share repurchases going forward. In line with that, during the third quarter, we acquired 118 communication sites and the rights to manage 2 additional communication sites for $47.9 million. We also built 134 sites during the third quarter. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have acquired 35 additional communication sites at an aggregate purchase price of $24.4 million. Also, as of today, we have 1,275 additional sites under contract for acquisition at an aggregate price of $332.2 million. 1,228 of these additional sites under contract are located in international markets where we currently operate, including Peru, Colombia and Brazil, with over 900 of the sites located in Brazil. We anticipate most of these sites under contract closing in early 2018. We continue to look for opportunities to add quality assets in markets where we are comfortable operating and can leverage our existing scale and platform to maximize returns. We also continue to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $14.8 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 32 years. In addition to the strides we've made in securing attractive portfolio investment opportunities, we also continued to invest in our existing assets through significant share repurchases. Since the date of our last earnings release, we have spent $400 million to repurchase 2.8 million shares at an average price of $144.13 per share. This brings our total year-to-date share purchases to $650 million for 4.6 million shares. Notwithstanding the significant investments we've made, we remain comfortably within our target leverage range, demonstrating the tremendous organic deleveraging capabilities of our business. Our steady EBITDA growth and access to low-cost debt, as evidenced by our recent high yield transaction, which Mark will discuss in a moment, allow us to continue driving growth in AFFO per share through leveraged capital investment. Looking ahead now to the fourth quarter, our earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2017. We have increased the midpoint of our guidance ranges for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share. These increases were primarily due to lower third quarter FX rates and revised expectations around fourth quarter FX rates, a small reduction in expected straight-line revenue as well as actual third quarter results. Our assumptions for operational leasing activity during the remainder of 2017 remain the same with the levels we experienced in the third quarter and the same as the assumptions we made when providing our updated guidance in July. We have also increased our outlook for net cash interest expense and nondiscretionary capital expenditures for the year. The increase in anticipated net cash interest expense is a result of higher average outstanding balances on our revolver due to share repurchases and incremental interest cost to be incurred in connection with our recently completed $750 million senior unsecured notes issuance. The increase in nondiscretionary CapEx is due to $1 million of estimated capital expenditures associated with hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. We did have one site badly damaged in the U.S. Virgin Islands. But otherwise, our assets fared pretty well during these storms as well as the California wildfires. There is much cleanup and repair work to be done, including rebuilding the damaged USVI tower, repairing access roads and fences, debris removal and safety inspection checks. We currently estimate that we will incur approximately $5 million in total during 2018 associated with these storm-related items, which amount will be a mix of OpEx and CapEx. We want to commend our employees, particularly those in and those who have traveled to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for the tireless work that they put in to make sure we were able to provide immediate support to our customers and the local communities affected by these devastating storms. All of them went above and beyond the call of duty. With that, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of net debt, and our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3x, within our targeted range of 7x to 7.5x. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA and net cash interest expense was 3.8x. We ended the quarter with $430 million outstanding under our $1 billion revolver, but we have no balance outstanding as of today. On October 13, we issued $750 million of unsecured senior notes. These notes bear interest at a rate of 4% per annum, payable semiannually and mature on October 1, 2022. Net proceeds from these offering were used to repay $460 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Pro forma for this transaction, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt was 3.6%, and our weighted average maturity was approximately 4.2 years. Year-to-date, as of today, as Brendan mentioned earlier, we have repurchased 4.6 million shares of common stock for $650 million at an average price per share of $140.47. We currently have $350 million of authorization remaining under our stock repurchase program. Current shares outstanding are 117.5 million, down from 124.1 million a year ago. We continue to be pleased with our capital structure, which we believe maximizes our ability to drive growth and AFFO per share. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. As you heard from Brendan earlier, we had another good quarter. We delivered solid financial results including industry-leading operating margins and strong year-over-year growth in AFFO per share. We also continued to grow our portfolio and made significant strides in shrinking our share count. Our positive results in the quarter, combined with the adjusted expectations for improved foreign exchange rates, have allowed us to again increase our full year 2017 guidance. In the U.S., operational customer activity was as expected with a solid mix of new leases and amendments. Growth drivers continue to include LTE capacity upgrades as well as AWS-3 overlays, 1,900, 700 and 600 megahertz deployments. While this year has been steady in the U.S., we believe operational leasing activity next year should be better. We've begun to see some initial applications from AT&T incorporating FirstNet needs, although nothing material yet. As of today, 25 states and 2 territories have opted into FirstNet, and many more are expected over the next couple of months. We are excited about the prospects for SBA associated with FirstNet and expect to see deployment starting some time in 2018. In addition to FirstNet, however, there are many other potential drivers for future growth over the next few years, including 2.5 gigahertz WCS and continued AWS-3, 600 megahertz, 700 megahertz deployment as well as the potential deployment of DISH's spectrum. And based on Sprint's public comments and the rumors that just kind of broke earlier today, Sprint appears to be on the verge of the first material investment in macro radios and antennas in years. As we've stated in the past, we think being a predominantly U.S. macro tower company will be a great position to be in for years to come. And while things are good in the U.S. and expected to get better, we continue to be very pleased with our international results.  Our third quarter international operational leasing activity was very good, including a nice increase in international operational leasing activity in Brazil. Increasing mobile data usage continues to be a positive, supportive trend for our future lease-up prospects in our international markets. The international activity this quarter came about 55% from amendments and 45% from new leases. Notwithstanding the extreme negative FX movements we initially experienced in Brazil when we first entered the market, we have generated very nice returns on our invested capital, creating significant value for our shareholders through our investments down there.  We believe our solid performance in our international markets demonstrates the selective investment and quality assets in markets where we have healthy customers, and strong relationships with those customers can drive incremental returns through efficient management and leveraging our existing size and scale. And with that experience in mind, we have recently entered into agreements to purchase over 1,200 additional assets in several of our existing international markets, including, most significantly, Brazil, Peru and Colombia. And as Brendan mentioned, over 900 of those towers are located in Brazil. They are particularly high-quality sites built by a Brazilian private equity-backed independent tower company in mature sites and quality locations that are very complementary to our existing portfolio. The existing revenue base from these sites under contract come primarily from TIM and Vivo, and only 2% of the added revenues come from Oi, so it's a very nice diversification of our revenue mix down there. We're very excited about the prospects for these towers particularly as the Brazilian economy continues to improve. Speaking of Oi, the restructuring process continues to move along slowly. The general meeting of creditors is currently scheduled for the week of November 6. While there are several competing interests involved in the process, we continue to believe a successful judicial restructuring will be the final outcome. In the meantime, operations between SBA and Oi continue as normal with timely collections of all amounts due as well as the execution of new amendments. While, of course, we would prefer to see the restructuring process completed more quickly, we remain very well positioned and expect to ultimately see a stronger customer emerge from this process. Looking now to the coming years, we continue to believe we are well positioned to achieve our goal of $10 or more of AFFO per share by 2020. In order to achieve this goal, we believe it remains imperative to optimize our balance sheet and make sound decisions with regard to capital allocation. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with 7.3x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, well within our target range of 7.0 to 7.5x. During the quarter and subsequent to quarter-end, we had great success in allocating capital to both meaningful portfolio growth and meaningful share repurchases. The number of towers that we have under contract for acquisition will be adequate to meet our goal of growing our portfolio by 5% to 10% this year, although some of these sites may not end up closing until early 2018. Our significant liquidity and access to attractively priced additional financing, such as our recently closed 4% unsecured high yield issuance, allows us to continue to use our balance sheet to drive increased returns for our shareholders. We remain solidly on track to achieve our goal of at least $10 or more of AFFO per share by 2020. We continue to be a strong performer in a tremendous industry. We believe the high quality of our assets and the many years of experience we have in optimizing the operations of the tower company will allow us to continue to grow AFFO per share at an enhanced level and thus to continue to provide strong returns to our investors. In wrapping up, I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their contributions to our success. I'd also like to echo Brendan's earlier comments in thanking our employees for their resiliency and significant contributions during the third quarter dealing with the many challenges brought on by the major hurricanes that affected many of the markets where we operate. I'm proud to be associated with such a dedicated and determined group of people. And with that, Terry, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery: Jeff, you talked a little bit about FirstNet. Can you give us any more color about what that sort of looks like in terms of new colocation versus amendments? And it doesn't come bundled with WCS, so it might be a bigger amendment than normal. And then any updates on how carrier pricing is? They've clearly talked for a while about pushing back on 3% escalators. What's the latest from your perspective on that?
Jeffrey Stoops: We have not seen any changes in our escalators, and you see kind of where we are in our supplemental filing. It's always a topic of discussion, Simon, but it's not one that -- we would much rather engage on other topics. And with inflation rising a little bit and interest rates rising a little bit, the kind of arguments on either side of that kind of ebb and flow. In terms of what FirstNet looks like, I think mostly for us it will be an amendment process. It still is yet to fully take shape. I do believe AT&T should be taken at their word when they say, "We are really trying to do this as best as we can in one truck roll," so they are continuing to kind of do a lot of work on their side. There is a lot of fieldwork being done in terms of auditing the assets, figuring out exactly what is there now and what kind of space is available and then them figuring out what exactly they want to do in that one truck roll. So I think 2018 is going to be an active year for the industry and certainly for SBA in that front. But I mean, given the fact that you're talking about 700 megahertz spectrum, which promulgates pretty well, I don't know, the exact number of cell sites for AT&T, but it's pretty big, I think you're going to see certainly for us mostly amendment business.
Operator: And now to the line of Jonathan Aiken from RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin: So I guess, my questions are mainly international related. First of all, in your Brazil business, can you remind us of how much of your in-place contracts are -- have escalators that are based on CPI versus fixed. Given the decline in Brazilian CPI, it strikes me that you have kind of a nice tailwind into the business going forward. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly. And then I wondered if you could provide any sort of thoughts on the Argentina market.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Jon, on the first question, roughly half of our revenue, basically all of the Oi leases on the 3 portfolios that we bought from them, had a floor of 6.5% on the escalators.
Jeffrey Stoops: On the Argentina market, we're very excited about that market because we think it's going to be a long, long development type of market. What I mean by that is at this point, because of the way the assets have been depreciated on the carriers books down there, most people don't think that there will be sales of assets down there, Jonathan. Now I could wake up tomorrow and there will be a headline and I could be wrong, but that has been the commentary. So really what you're going to see, I think, is a lot of greenfield building. And for a big established company like ours, I think that's really where we shine. We get into these markets, and we just set up our processes and procedures, and we have the resources and the staying power to get in there and continue to grow year after year after year. I mean, Brazil is a good example of that. I think this past quarter, we've built the most towers in Brazil that we've ever built on a quarterly basis, and I think we will be reporting similar results in Argentina for years to come.
Jonathan Atkin: And then turning to the U.S., just any different trends to think about in terms of the drivers of your services business?
Jeffrey Stoops: I think they're to come. I mean, candidly, Q3 was pretty right down the middle of the fairway. There really wasn't any changes at all from where we ended Q2 and where we thought things would be and frankly where we see Q4 being. I think everything is building towards the FirstNet and the one truck roll and then the increased activity levels that Sprint has been talking about and the release of the macro work that hasn't really been there for the last several years. And all of that, we see it building, and we see a lot of things happening around that. But in terms of it actually starting to hit and certainly in terms of financial impact, it's not going to be until 2018. But it's all there, and it's all building.
Operator: And now to the line of Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays.
Amir Rozwadowski: I was wondering if we could drill down a little in terms of your commentary on the demand environment. Clearly, it sounds like FirstNet is on the calm, and you're seeing some initial activity. Is there expectation for the improved demand environment obviously predicated on FirstNet? Or is it right to assume here that you're seeing improved activity across the board when it comes to the carriers? I know you'd mentioned maybe some relief at Sprint. Just want to make sure sort of what the visibility is there, Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves into 2018. But I think the commentary right now, the only changes that I would really want to point out today, and we'll obviously point them out, others as they occur, would be the expectation around FirstNet and the expectation around change, a positive change in Sprint's behavior.
Amir Rozwadowski: That's very helpful. And then was wondering, do you expect any sort of change in the U.S. competitive landscape? There's been some chatter about Lendlease getting involved in the market potentially with a partnership with SoftBank. There's been some fairly big numbers thrown about in terms of sites that could be available or anything along those lines. I would suspect that you guys have pretty good visibility if there were significant sites available in the marketplace, so would love any color that you're seeing there.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I'm pretty surprised with that chatter. That deal was a surprise to the rest of the folks in the tower industry. My understanding is those aren't towers. Those are single-user rooftop sites that I don't know if they're usable by non-Sprint users. So I always kind of look at that more as a financing transaction. I could be wrong, but I don't really see that as changing the competitive dynamic. I mean, it certainly adds capital to the competitive mix, but there's always been plenty of capital chasing this industry, Amir.
Operator: And now to the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James.
Richard Prentiss: One U.S., one international. Jeff, thanks for the color on FirstNet. As we think about the timing, how should we think about them ramping FirstNet, your ability to have the visibility or feel comfortable in guidance? And is it something that requires an MLA? Or just trying to think of what the kind of benefit and how we should think of it ramping throughout '18. I know you're not giving guidance, but just philosophically how it would ramp.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, it doesn't require an MLA. If you have an MLA, you may book straight-line probably ahead of it, similar to what others did with MLAs in the past. Don't know if people should expect that or not from us. And then it's probably a lot like it always has been. I mean, depending on when you sign things up, the actual revenue accrual might lag 3 to 6 months or more. Amendments typically go faster than colos but there's always a lag period from the time you actually sign the amendment up to the time that the work gets done and the equipment gets put on the site. And I wouldn't expect that to be really any different than the typical business.
Richard Prentiss: Right. And AT&T sounds like they're pretty anxious to get going, and tax reform might get it even more interested, it sounded like.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I mean, I do. Based on their commentary, I would agree with you. But I think they are going to wait until 2018 to really get going.
Richard Prentiss: Oh, yes, no, they said January is where they'd kind of ramp-up. Okay, on the international side, Brendan, I think you mentioned that Brazil was about 13% of your cash site but 9% of your cash site ex passers. How should we think about this next wave of acquisitions? How big will Brazil come? Just trying to factor in our early thoughts on what these acquisitions might mean to the numbers.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, I mean, the acquisitions are not all in Brazil but that component of it. You're talking about adding maybe a couple of percentage points. It will have the same structure as our existing operations down there, so the expenses, the ground rents specifically, will be passed through. So we're looking at our overall international mix, which today is 17-ish, 17% to 18%, probably goes up by 2%. So I would figure Brazil, excluding pass-throughs, is somewhere around 11-or-so percent post these deals.
Richard Prentiss: Makes sense. We're getting a lot of questions about fiber to the tower internationally as well, and that's important for 4G. How do you guys look at fiber to the tower down there? Is that something you might get involved with?
Jeffrey Stoops: We're looking at it and evaluating it just like we did here, Rick. And so far, we haven't concluded anything. And if we did, I mean, it wouldn't be material for a while, but we'll keep you posted.
Operator: And now to the line of Matthew Niknam from Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Niknam: Just two on strategic and mainly capital allocation. First, can you give us an update on the latest you're seeing in terms of valuations and availability of sizable portfolios internationally? And I just mentioned it in the context of some of the announced transactions you expect to close, and I want to get a sense of if anything has changed either in terms of supply or just valuations. And then secondly, are there any other M&A sizable opportunities you're considering? Just wondering how to sort of think about buyback pacing relative to M&A on the forward.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I don't think we're going to answer the second one for competitive reasons. But I'll tell you the first one. We've been working on these transactions for most of the year. And during this time, there were a couple, three transactions that went away from us that we were interested in. And there are probably a couple more that we are aware of. But I will tell you, Matt, that none of it is so great that you shouldn't think that there isn't room for both asset growth and stock repurchases. Obviously, the numbers allocated to each will vary, but I would expect that we do a little bit of both as we move forward. Maybe some quarters we don't do one, do more of the other, as we did this year, but I fully expect to do both moving forward.
Matthew Niknam: And if I could just follow-up, the deals you mentioned that went away from you, was that more just relative valuation and you saw more opportunity in buying back your own stock? Or is there anything else that impacted those?
Jeffrey Stoops: It's always valuation with us, always relative valuation.
Operator: And now to the line of Batya Levi from UBS.
Batya Levi: Can you provide maybe some more color in terms of the tenancy in that portfolio? In terms of expected growth, will it be similar to growth you're seeing in the region, and impact on AFFO?
Brendan Cavanagh: We missed the first part of your question. It didn't sound like you're on. I'm sorry. Can you repeat it?
Batya Levi: Sure. The international portfolio, that you announced you're purchasing mainly in Brazil, can you provide more color in terms of tenancy, growth rates and accretion on AFFO?
Jeffrey Stoops: We expect it to be accretive to AFFO per share growth. I believe the tenancy today is either 1.1 or 1.2 tenants per tower.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, they're very immature sites.
Jeffrey Stoops: Which is why we like it.
Brendan Cavanagh: Right. They're very immature sites. We expect them to actually grow at a faster rate than our existing legacy business. So they should be growth additive or accretive, I guess, to our growth rates.
Batya Levi: Okay. And then one follow-up on the leverage target. Would you consider to take it higher for the right acquisition, or if we get a pullback in the stock, if we get industry consolidation in the U.S., how do you think about that target?
Jeffrey Stoops: We probably would be more likely to consider taking it higher for a good acquisition where we could see our way to clearly delever back within a year, less likely on the stock repurchases side of things.
Operator: And now to the line the Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson.
Nicholas Del Deo: Over the summer, I've been hearing from a number of folks that the expectations of sellers in Latin America were you're generally kind of out of whack with what you're willing to pay. Given the towers you have under contract and your commentary around the pipelines, is it safe to say that there's been some favorable movement there? Or have you guys kind of moved up in terms of what you're willing to pay?
Jeffrey Stoops: It's been a long year, Nick. We've been very patient and methodical in our approach, and we finally got where we needed to be.
Nicholas Del Deo: Okay, good outcome. And I guess, more generally speaking, as you think of maybe a future leg of international expansion, you've been exclusive in the Western hemisphere today. I think in the past, you've suggested that you may eventually choose to move further afield. Can you talk about what sort of attributes you want to see to get you interested in markets outside of the Western hemisphere? And how do you think the size of the opportunity might line up versus what you have here?
Jeffrey Stoops: I think we're going to be most interested in those markets that have higher growth rates where we can go in and add to what we have and have it be additive and supportive of a levered capital appreciation strategy.
Operator: And now to the line of David Barden from Bank of America.
David Barden: I guess, a couple. Just maybe, Jeff, following up on the comments about the FirstNet being an amendment. I know that there was kind if a wait-and-see period to understand what the kind of physical parameters of the infrastructure would be, the panel antennas for the 700 megahertz, et cetera. I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit on kind of the magnitude of an amendment that this is going to turn out to be from a size and weight and wind shear perspective. And the second was just on 134 new towers, kind of where they got built and what the investment was? And then last, obviously, the jury is still out, of course. We've been whipsawed a little bit on some of those Sprint, T-Mobile mergers, but we kind of love to know your gut reaction, if you could kind of pick a direction where we to go, consolidate or don't consolidate the wireless market, which one is best for SBA?
Jeffrey Stoops: I'm going to pun a little bit on the amendment pricing because it's going to depend a lot on is the particular tower going to include AWS-3 and WCS. I mean, in general, I do think obviously, we're going to see new radios. You got to have new radios for the FirstNet spectrum. And generally, I think you're going to see new antennas, so I think that's going to be, at worse, a good moderately sized amendment. And then it could go up from there. Brendan's looking for the answer to your second question. But on the Sprint, T-Mo, it's kind of six of one, half a dozen of the other, because the early, and obviously our stocks are all up today on the prospect of 4, staying 4. But I do think that there is -- it's not entirely that black-and-white. I do think a combination that actually is stronger with 3, where you have investment over time, where the combination of Sprint, T-Mobile, basically invest more than either of the 2 on a combined -- if you add the 2 investments up would have done before. And I actually believe that would happen at some point in the future if they get together. I think that's probably good. So I don't see this as binary as the market sees it.
Brendan Cavanagh: And Dave, on the newbuild question. So of the 134, 119 of those were built internationally, only 15 were built in the U.S. And of the 119, a big chunk of those, 57 of those were in Brazil. And then it was spread throughout our other markets, but the biggest contributors were Costa Rica and Nicaragua.
David Barden: And what's the total investment there, Brendan?
Brendan Cavanagh: Dollar-wise?
David Barden: Yes.
Jeffrey Stoops: It's in the press release, isn't it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think in the press release, we do have it. I don't know off the top of my head, I apologize. But even that disclosure in the press release, in the press release, it says construction of new sites, the $16.8 million, that would be the cash flow that was spent during the quarter. So some of that would've been for sites that are in progress as well as the sites that got completed.
Operator: And now to the line of Walter Piecyk from BTIG.
Walter Piecyk: A couple of follow-ups. When AT&T or whoever replaces an antenna, if they have multiple ports for different spectrum bands, is that what increases the price? Is it price on spectrum based on the number of ports in the antenna? Or does the price increase for them on the amendment basis depending on whether they actually hook up a radio into that port for that particular band?
Jeffrey Stoops: We have the right, Walt, to charge anytime there's any change out of equipment, whether it's bigger, smaller, fatter, skinnier. We don't typically do that. What we typically do, and this is exactly what interestingly our customers say they want, we just happen to do it, is we typically only charge additional amounts when the change takes up additional load, such as when there's a heavier or a wider antenna. Now we have the right to charge at different times, we typically don't.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. So if they put up an antenna that have extra ports for future spectrum usages, it will go up today, whatever the max is. And if they came back in and layered in additional radios for WCS, AWS-4 whatever it is, there's no incremental charge at that point from you guys?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, no. Anytime they're adding or changing, there's an opportunity for us under the structure of our agreements to charge something. Now whether we do or not, we look at every fact and circumstance of that particular site. So in your hypothetical, when you add or change -- any hypothetical, Walt, that you use where there's an add or a change of a radio or antenna, we could charge more, but we often don't.
Walter Piecyk: Got you. And then on your spring commentary from earlier, just so I understand this correctly, are you saying that based on news reports you think they might be more active in macro next year? Or has there actually been some indication from the company that they're actually going to start spending again?
Jeffrey Stoops: Based on their third quarter commentary and what we're seeing in the field and in our application pipeline.
Walter Piecyk: That's great, awesome. And then just lastly then, can you give us a similar update on T-Mobile and Verizon? Verizon, I'm thinking more broadly for the year, but T-Mobile more recently. Has there been any kind of change in the activity from T-Mobile or Verizon? Is Verizon generally up or down this year versus last? And did some of the changes that they've had in there is CTO office changed the outlook that you have from them for 2018 or 2019?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I don't want to get that granular with either T-Mobile or Verizon. And the only reason I did with Sprint because it is such a change from their prior behavior where there hasn't really been anything over the last couple of years, but I would say that we see both Verizon and T-Mobile kind of being steady as she goes.
Operator: And now to the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brandon Nispel: I guess, would you guys consider roughly $25 million in new leasing activities a stable run rate? Or can you help us understand what could drop off in terms of new spectrum deployments from 2017 and obviously then you have 600, 2.5 and FirstNet coming on in 2018.
Jeffrey Stoops: No, because you're trying to get to 2018 guidance, and I would prefer we not do that.
Operator: And now to the line of Robert Gutman from Guggenheim.
Robert Gutman: In the prepared remarks, you mentioned the WCS and AWS-3 spectrum, and I wasn't clear if you're implying that those are current drivers. Are you seeing activity from that already? And if you are, then how would that be impacted by throwing in FirstNet next year?
Jeffrey Stoops: No, I was implying that that's still to come as mostly part of this one truck roll that it will be -- we still expect to see a lot of that rolled into the one truck roll from AT&T along with FirstNet.
Operator: And now to the line of Rosa Velásquez from State Street.
Rosa Velásquez: I think my question is very specific to Brazil. So thank you for the update on Oi. I think you mentioned that it's undergoing this slow process of judicial reorganization. So I'm just wondering if in your scenarios, have you considered the possibility of a potential consolidation among the top players in the field? And if so, I just want to get a sense of what's the possibility of redundant network territories and then nonrenewal of leases to Oi? So that's my first question. Part of this is these recent acquisitions in Brazil, would that be part of a strategy to maybe offset this risk? And then my second question is related to an intercompany loan agreement with Brazilian entities. I'm not sure if this is still in place. But if so, what's the limit and then what's outstanding, if you're able to share that?
Jeffrey Stoops: Okay. On your first question, we have thought about that, and there are two current rumored consolidation possibilities for Oi. One would be with TIM, and that's been long rumored, and that kind of comes and goes depending on the day of the week. For that to happen, there would need to be certain regulatory changes around the concession loss in Brazil or TIM, I don't think, would be interested. If that were to happen, and I've said this many times before, I actually don't think that 4 carriers going to 3 in Brazil would necessarily be a bad thing. I think you'd have stronger customers, and as we've said many times, the need in Brazil is huge.  The only thing that's holding Brazil back is actually the strength and the cash flows of our customers because they need tremendous network investment. So the stronger they are, the more benefit, I think, we would see from that. So that's not necessarily bad. I don't know if it's going to happen or not. There would have to be particularly some regulatory changes for that to occur. And the other more recently rumored consolidation would be China Mobile coming in and looking to take over Oi, which, of course, would not be a consolidation event but you have an extremely well-capitalized new entrant into the Brazilian market, which would be good for us. Brendan, do you have the -- she's asking about the intercompany loan that changes based on the movements in the reais.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. It was one of the acquisitions that we did in Brazil. We funded it through an intercompany loan from a U.S. subsidiary to our Brazilian entity. It's denominated in U.S. dollars. And so when there are changes in the FX rate each quarter, the value of that loan or the gain or loss that exists on that loan as a result of those FX changes flows through our P&L statement. So it does cause for some funny moves up and down in terms of our P&L, but really, it's money that we owe within the SBA umbrella to ourselves.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And now to the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.
Philip Cusick: A couple of follow-ups. FirstNet, you've signed a few leases, it sounds like, though a small number. Do you think those are representative of what you'll see going forward? And how do they compare to the average amendment?
Jeffrey Stoops: I did not say we signed any. I said we have...
Philip Cusick: Oh, you said you're seeing some early activity.
Jeffrey Stoops: No, we have early application activity.
Philip Cusick: Oh, application activity, excuse me.
Brendan Cavanagh: Application activity.
Jeffrey Stoops: I'm sure I was not clear.
Philip Cusick: And then with the 1,200 new sites that you've contracted to buy, should we expect a level of slowdown in the buyback pace?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, maybe in Q4.
Brendan Cavanagh: You should expect we continue to operate within our leverage target, and so that provides whatever it provides.
Philip Cusick: Okay. And then finally, there's been a lot going on in the African tower markets. How do you think about those markets? Have you looked at them? And if so, are they interesting, or if you sort of looked and passed a few times?
Jeffrey Stoops: I think they could be interesting for the right price. I think the biggest issue there -- well, there are 2 big issues in Africa. One is the power issue, and I do believe that the companies there have spent the last several years doing a good job of getting on top of that issue. And then, of course, you have the currency issue. Those would be the two big concerns, both of which, I think, can be solved with the right financial transaction. Africa is the kind of market that, to the earlier question that I answered, would fit within our kind of growthy type of market, that would fit well, I think, into our levered capital appreciation strategy.
Philip Cusick: I would you imagine doing sort of a -- think of it sort of as a Canadian built-to-suit starting from scratch? Or would you need to do a pretty sizable transaction to really start that type of region?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, you'd always want to go in with some size and some scale if you can do it for the right financial terms. I mean, that's always the preferred approach. And that would have been the approach in Canada if it was available to us.
Operator: Thank you. We have no more questions in queue. Please continue.
Jeffrey Stoops: I want to thank everyone for joining us, and we look forward to the next time we're together, which will be some time in February when we report our fourth quarter results and when we provide our initial 2018 outlook. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the SBA 2017 Second Quarter Results Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there'll be an opportunity for your question and instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to, Mr. Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark C. DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2017 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, July 31, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our Supplemental Financial Data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn the call over to Brendan to comment on our second quarter results.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. The company had another steady financial performance in the second quarter. Our performance was once again primarily driven by solid operational performance on the leasing side of our business. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $403.0 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $398.9 million. Better than expected foreign exchange rates positively impacted leasing revenue by less than $0.7 million relative to the company's prior expectations for the second quarter. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter was 4.6% over the second quarter of 2016. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 7.5%. The net same tower growth calculation was negatively impacted by approximately 2.9% of churn. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth, over the second quarter of last year, was 7% on a gross basis and 3.8% on a net basis, excluding 3.2% of churn, over 70% of which was related to Metro, Leap and Clearwire terminations. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, gross same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 10.7%, exclusive of 50 basis points of churn. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 10.8%. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue signed up during the quarter, was ahead of 2016 levels, although based on revenue commencement timing, we do not expect this increase in lease up to have a material impact on our 2017 results. Just over half of incremental domestic leasing revenue added came from amendments, and the big four carriers represented 86% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue added during the quarter. International leasing activity remained consistent with 2016 average levels, with continued solid contributions from all of our markets. During the second quarter, 86.4% of cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.8% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.1% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. With regard to second quarter churn, we continued to see churn from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire, consistent with our expectations. As of June 30, we have approximately $31 million of annual recurring run rate revenue or less than 2% of annual leasing revenue from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next two years to three years. That's down from $38 million at year-end and $50 million at September 30, 2016. Domestic churn in the second quarter from all other tenants on an annual same-tower basis remained less than 1%. We continue to expect domestic same tower churn rate to be in the mid-2% range by the end of the year. The total amount of churn continues to be as expected and is not anticipated to impact our long-term goal of producing $10 or more of AFFO per share in 2020. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $317.2 million. Better-than-expected foreign exchange rates positively impacted tower cash flow by approximately $0.4 million relative to prior expectations. We continue to have success controlling the direct cost associated with our towers, allowing us to continue to have the strongest operating margins in the industry. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 82% in the quarter, and international tower cash flow margin was 68.7%. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $298.8 million. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $0.4 million relative to our expectations. Our adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were due to solid results from both our leasing and services businesses. SG&A for the quarter was generally in line with expectations, but up year-over-year, excluding the Oi reserve due primarily to increased personnel-related costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.6% in the quarter, compared to 70.1% in the year earlier period, excluding the Oi reserve. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. AFFO in the second quarter was $211.2 million, which amount was positively impacted by approximately $0.4 million relative to prior expectations due to stronger foreign exchange rates. Our industry-leading AFFO per share increased 16.9% to $1.73 excluding the impact of the $16.5 million Oi reserve that was reported in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding both the Oi reserve and the positive year-over-year impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, AFFO per share increased 14.7% over the year earlier period. We continue to selectively deploy capital towards portfolio growth. In the second quarter, we acquired 228 communication sites including 143 sites in Peru and the rights to manage 37 additional communication sites for $124.2 million, comprised of $60.9 million in cash and the issuance of approximately 488,000 shares of our Class A common stock. We also built 96 sites during the second quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have acquired 68 additional communication sites, including 35 sites in Argentina at an aggregate purchase price of $16.5 million. The sites purchased and built in the second quarter as well as these additional sites are located in both domestic and international markets. Jeff will touch briefly on our two new markets of Peru and Argentina in a moment. We continue to invest in the land under our sites, as this is both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $16.4 million to buy land and easements, and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. Looking forward, our earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2017. We have increased the midpoint of our guidance ranges for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA by $5.5 million each. These increases were due to a variety of factors, including actual second quarter results, revised expectations around forward FX rates, and the impact of acquisitions put under contract since our first quarter earnings release. Our assumptions for operational leasing activity during the remainder of 2017 remain exactly the same as the assumptions we made, when providing our initial 2017 guidance in February and the updated guidance we provided in May. We have not assumed any permanent pick-up in operational leasing activity for the second half of the year. We have also increased our outlook for AFFO by $7 million at the midpoint, and AFFO per share by $0.075 at the midpoint. The increase in AFFO guidance is due to our higher expected adjusted EBITDA and lower expected non-discretionary cash capital expenditures, offset by slightly higher expected net cash interest expense. The decrease in non-discretionary CapEx is due to lower experienced maintenance and general corporate CapEx during the first half of the year than we had previously expected. The increase in anticipated net cash interest expense is primarily a result of increased LIBOR rates on our floating rate debt, as well as higher estimated average outstanding balances on our revolver due to share repurchases. The updated outlook does not assume any impact from potential acquisitions not under contract as of today, and it does not assume any impact from new financings or repurchases of the company's stock, other than those that have been completed as of today. With that, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark C. DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $8.6 billion of net debt. And our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.2 times, within our targeted range of 7 to 7.5 times. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.0 times. We ended the quarter with $150 million outstanding under our $1 billion revolver, and we have $215 million outstanding as of today. At quarter-end, the weighted average coupon on our outstanding debt was 3.6% and our weighted average maturity was approximately 4.4 years. On April 17, we issued, through our existing tower trust, $760 million of secured tower revenue securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of April 11, 2022, and a final maturity date of April 9, 2047. The fixed interest rate on these securities is 3.168%. Net proceeds from the offering were used to prepay our $610 million of 2012-1C Tower Securities, which carry an interest rate of 2.933%, as well as accrued and unpaid interest and also for general corporate purposes. Year-to-date as of today, we have repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $250 million at an average price per share of $134.98. We currently have $750 million of authorization remaining under our stock repurchase program. Current shares outstanding are 120.2 million, down from 124.6 million shares a year ago. We are very pleased with our capital structure. SBA continues to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets and as a result, we believe our structure maximizes our ability to drive growth in AFFO per share. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. As you heard from Brendan earlier, we had another solid quarter. We continued to execute well growing our portfolio, increasing our operating margins, efficiently meeting the increasing demands of our customers, growing AFFO and shrinking our share count. Our positive results in the quarter combined with adjusted expectations for improved foreign exchange rates have allowed us to again increase our full year 2017 guidance. In the U.S., operational customer activity measured as the amount of newly contracted cash revenue per tower, was up sequentially from the prior quarter for the second quarter in a row. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of new leases signed, although the majority of new business is still coming in the form of amendments. Organic leasing activity in the quarter remained primarily from the refarming of 2G and 3G spectrum to LTE, as well as some AWS-1 and 700 megahertz deployments. We have also begun to see 600 megahertz applications. Internationally, we had another steady quarter of operational leasing activity. This activity was approximately 60% from new leases and 40% from amendments in the second quarter. We again had strong contributions from all of our markets including Brazil, where we continue to see steady results. In general, international growth on a same tower basis should remain superior to the U.S. for years, given the lesser maturity and density of the networks in international markets, and the lower revenue per tower, of which the growth rates are calculated. On the portfolio side, we entered two new markets that we have been evaluating over the last couple of years, Peru and Argentina. We now operate and own towers in 13 countries in the Western hemisphere. During the second quarter, we acquired 143 sites in Peru and in July, we acquired 35 sites in Argentina, the first sites we own in each of these countries. Each of these markets has characteristics we like and we believe we can increase the towers we own materially in coming years. In Peru, there are four competitive active wireless carriers and rapid growth occurring in the percentage of the population accessing wireless mobile Internet services. The deployment of 700 megahertz 4G LTE spectrum that was auctioned off by the government in 2016 will be a big driver of continued investment in the wireless networks at Telefónica, Claro, and m:tel in particular. The government has also recently called for significant increases in the number of cell sites in Peru to meet the quickly growing demands and needs of the population. Argentina is one of the largest markets in South America and we believe will be a source of meaningful growth opportunities over the coming years. The investment in wireless infrastructure has been significantly lacking in Argentina for many years. But with the recent change in government in Argentina, we have seen significant strides in the country's efforts to attract external investment. There are three main wireless carriers in the market with a relatively equal market share. We expect competition and lagging wireless network performance to be drivers of meaningful investment by all three of these carriers. We are excited about the opportunities that both of these new markets present. Our strategy in these new markets will be the same as throughout the rest of Latin America; establish SBA as a long-term player with superior financial and operational resources and cultivate deep relationships with our customers based on trust and performance. It's a recipe that has led us to a leadership position in Latin America. Looking ahead, we continue to feel very good about the environment in which we're operating. As we discussed last quarter, our customers have many things to accomplish over the coming years. In the U.S., deployments of AWS-3, WCS, 2.5 Gigahertz, and 600 Megahertz spectrum will all be drivers of future organic leasing activity for a number of years. And of course, significant opportunity exists around AT&T's deployment of the FirstNet network. While the FirstNet deployment efforts have not yet officially begun, all indications are that we are getting closer to the commencement of a large wave of infrastructure investment associated with this project. As of today, seven states have now announced their intention to opt in to the nationwide FirstNet network and many others are expected to follow. Specific implications to SBA of this rollout are still being defined, and we do not anticipate any material impact to our 2017 financial results, but we continue to expect this important nationwide build-out to be a positive contributor to our growth for the next several years. On the expense side, we continue to execute well, driving increased efficiency and cost reductions throughout our organization, as well as continuing to reduce land cost through our active ground lease buy-out program. Our solid performance in cost control as well as our steady success in organic leasing growth, have allowed us to again lead the industry in Tower Cash Flow and adjusted EBITDA margins. Our domestic Tower Cash Flow margin is now an impressive 82% and internationally we have grown our Tower Cash Flow margin to 68.7%, even as we continue to add many new immature towers to our portfolio. With regards to capital allocation and balance sheet optimization, we ended the quarter with 7.2 times net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, within our target range of 7.0 times to 7.5 times. During the quarter, we allocated capital to portfolio growth and share repurchases. It remains our goal and expectation that this year we will grow our portfolio by 5% to 10%. Within that range of portfolio growth, we believe we can continue to be very selective with regards to the tower assets we choose to buy and build. We expect to remain a predominantly U.S. macro tower company, a very strong position to be in for the next several years given expected deployments, and the reason we feel confident in the value being created through our share repurchases. Our significant liquidity and access to attractively priced additional financing allows us to continue to use our balance sheet to drive increased returns for our shareholders. In closing, we are well-positioned to achieve our goal of $10 or more of AFFO per share by 2020. A steady demand environment with our customers and strong operational execution, not only drove good second quarter results, but also give us increased confidence for a solid 2017 and achieving our long-term goals. SBA continues to be a strong performer in a tremendous industry. We have the highest quality assets and tremendous employees whose efforts continue to drive SBA on to greater success. We look forward to a successful remainder of 2017. Cathy, with that, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Go ahead, please.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much and good afternoon, folks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Hey, Amir.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Jeff, I was wondering if we could touch base a bit on FirstNet. And if we think about the commentary that you suggested is that you don't expect a near-term impact at least through 2017. How do you think that this sort of unfolds? I mean, are you guys – do you have visibility in terms of what type of benefits you could perceive from this, when do you expect to get that visibility? Would love any color that you can provide there.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. I'll give you some high-level color and obviously want to stay away from pricing and things like that. We have started to see specs and examples and how this might actually look. At this point, we believe that AT&T will choose to roll this out through their turf vendors, which is much of how they have done their deployments in the past. And that's the first level of agreements and contract that have to be worked through and then as the turf vendors would begin to execute on the plan, then obviously that really won't yet and can't I believe occur until after a particular state ops in, then we'll actually start to receive applications and then be in a position to move forward. So, I believe we're getting much closer. Will I be able to say next quarter as we have just said with respect the 600 Megahertz that we are seeing and receiving applications, I don't know. But I do feel that we're becoming obviously increasingly closer to that point.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then just one housekeeping question, if I may. The discretionary CapEx went up in the guidance. What is that specifically related to?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: It's primarily relate to additional acquisitions that have been put under contract.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Excellent, excellent. Thank you very much for the incremental color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead please.
Joshua Frantz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys. It's Josh Frantz, in for Dave. Thanks for taking the questions. Question on the deployment for different antennas. Can you talk about the relative revenue for an amendment for 600 Megahertz versus 700 Megahertz, versus AWS? And then also same for 2.5?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: We're not going to get into the exact differences between the types of amendments. I will tell you though that generally as you go lower in the frequency of the spectrum, the antennas get larger and as you would have larger antennas, you're going to typically attract larger amendment dollars.
Joshua Frantz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Is there any sort of size on revenue that you can – typical basis that you can give us?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: No. No, we're not going to get into pricing.
Joshua Frantz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, sounds good. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. A couple if I can. Brendan, can you repeat what you said about acquired churn for the second half of 2017 and into 2018, did you say 2.5% for total churn exiting 2017?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: I'm not sure if I said that but it is our expectation that when we – from a domestic standpoint, when we exit the year that we would be at about 2.5%.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And how should we think about remaining churn for 2018 from that acquired network of customers?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. So, we have – what I think what I gave in the scripted comments, was the total amount of dollars that we have that we believe will churn off from the three primary guys, Metro, Leap, and Clearwire, and that's $31 million of annual revenue at the end of the second quarter. I would expect they will come out of the year somewhere in the mid to low $20 million range probably is what would be left when we exit this year, and that would go away over the subsequent two years. So, you're really not talking about much of a large impact, exact timing of that two years obviously remains to be seen. But, hopefully that ballparks it for you in terms of magnitude.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And Jeff, you said that – it looks like AT&T will be using its regular turf vendors, you have relationships with those guys and I think you do services for them sometime, should we think about any impact on your services business this year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Too early to tell this year and I think there's some opportunity in the future, but time will tell.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And how does AT&T not owning that FirstNet Spectrum change their rights on towers, if they didn't have some bigger agreement?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, it's an amendment. I mean, it puts them in a position of having to come – it would be basically the standard amendment process, Phil.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And a standard amendment process like there's a – like sort of a score card, and using X, Y, and Z or it's a negotiation?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: It's not – I mean it's not much – I'm not sure that's a distinction that really bears a difference because they'd have to do that anyway because the equipment is going to be different.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I see. Okay. And if I can one more. You're aggressive on the buyback in the quarter and as well at the start of the third quarter. What's driving that and what does that tell us about the sort of opportunity set of other deals out there?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, it's telling you that we're delevering pretty quickly. We actually invested more capital in portfolio growth in Q2 than Q1. And we have hopes and aspirations and opportunities to continue to invest in portfolio growth. And as I mentioned, we do feel good about hitting at least the low end of the 5% for the year. And we want to stay in that 7 times to 7.5 times and no one should read the 7.2 times as any type of change there. And actually, as we were moving through the quarter, we saw that we're going to actually have lower leverage than we might have otherwise anticipated going into the quarter. So, we stepped up on the stock repurchases.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: And if the same thing happens again, we would most likely do the same thing.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Jeff, first a clarification. I think you said on the lease up some of them wouldn't commence such that they benefit 2017. Is there anything unusual about what you're seeing now in terms of stuff that's being signed now that doesn't commence until next year or is this pretty much as in prior years. And then, perhaps you could just comment on any non-traditional tenants interest that you're getting from folks? There's certainly been a lot of discussion about other players coming into the industry looking at potential network deployments. It would be great to just get a general sense of what your expectations are around moving beyond the big four in the U.S. and elsewhere?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: We're definitely seeing more leases, co-los in absolute numbers relative to past years, as part of the process and the give and take with various customers in various regions, it is not at all uncommon, Simon, where you would negotiate a rent commencement date of the earlier of installation or January 1, and until it's installed, we would count that as January 1, and obviously not include that in any type of guidance until we know. So, that's a fairly typical customer SBA type of negotiation that's going on, and I think that's fairly representative throughout the industry. But I think the good thing that comes out of all that is the number of co-los is up, which is good. In terms of other tenants, there's a lot of discussion and conversation and interest, but I can't point to anything material, Simon. And when we think about the business and plan and we are primarily, if not exclusively looking at the existing kind of base off which to build our future.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim. Go ahead, please.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, we've heard a lot of talk over the past quarter about 5G and how the first sort of wave of 5G will be fixed wireless, and I was wondering how, if you could just comment on your views of how that will play out in rural locations and within your footprint over the next several years?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, if true 5G, and it's not been defined yet by the technical authorities, but if it is true 5G, it will require different equipment than exists today to deploy it. So, you're looking at new equipment or different equipment or swapped equipment on the towers, so that of course is going to be an opportunity for us. And if it's using higher frequency spectrum, you'll need more dense networks and that of course will be an opportunity for us. So, I do think we will participate in that, Robert, when that time comes because I don't think what is out there today will satisfy 5G requirements.
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Okay. Was that all Mr. Gutman?
Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: All right. Thank you. Then, we'll go next to Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, please.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. So, couple of questions. As you look at the kind of the lower band activities around 600 Megahertz in FirstNet and you mentioned that you had seen some of the technical designs. What portion of the time are we potentially looking at a new RAD center as opposed to a traditional amendment at an existing RAD center?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: We haven't seen enough data, Jonathan, to speak even remotely intelligently to that question.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then just moving on. Delta suite activity in the U.S., not so much speaking for your company, but if you take the industry itself is going to be seeing more kind of requirements for that by the carriers over the next couple of quarters or years, any movement that you're seeing on that front?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, I think the last couple years have been historic lows for new builds industry wide. And I do think based on my understanding of some of the requirements of FirstNet and some of the other deployments with some of the other folks who want to make that, there will be more new builds necessary. I don't know that they ever get back to obviously the days when people were building for coverage, but they should be greater than what they were over the last couple years on an annual basis.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then I was curious about Brazil and any color that you could provide around the mix between co-los and amendments, as well as how you would think about the growth rates that you saw this quarter prior to escalator impacts?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, Brazil, I think is tracking logically, it is a less mature market. You would expect the ratio of new deployments to favor co-los over amendments and that's exactly what we've seen ever since we've been there. We expect that to continue. In terms of the growth rates ex-escalator, I think, they've been fairly stable.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: It's roughly 4% or so, Jon, you're seeing our overall growth rate come down a little bit and that's really the escalator dropping.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. And actually we continue to be pleased with what's going on in Brazil, given the economy, and we're actually seeing some signs of green shoots down there, the GDP, I think, most people – not that it's taking a tremendous leg up, but most people feel it's bottomed and it's starting to climb back in the right direction. So, we continue to feel very good about the long-term prospects of the Brazilian market.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then lastly, in the U.S., how much of your land is owned outright? You gave kind of the owned and controlled stat, is the outright ownership, that's somewhere in the 30% to 35% range or how would you kind of ballpark that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. That's about right. That's about right. That includes some professional leases (34:45) that we have to, is in that 35% range.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Two questions, one is really just a follow-up to the one that you just answered, which is a few years ago we had an issue with some land aggregators, I'm just curious do you have any one who owns a sizeable amount of your land under your towers right now?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: No.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: So, that issue seems to have passed the (35:14) as an industry.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, that's what I figured. So I'll ask my second question which is, as we hear the carriers talk more and more about how they're moving to the centralized RAN architecture, they talk about how they may be using or maybe they are already using some of their macro locations as the hubbing point for all this equipment, so kind of the host location for nearby small cells. I'm just curious if you've actually seen that play out where when they come to your sites, they're actually increasingly interested in what you can offer them from a ground space level. And if not, do you think you're going to have to go through some investment phase where there's something you need to do at your towers to actually support that type of architecture?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: The carriers – well, the – as you know, Brett, AT&T and Verizon have traditionally used 12x20 shelters at all of their outdoor sites. And within that shelter, they're allowed to do whatever they want. So, there are many instances where this is occurring at our sites and we would not know it. What they're looking for is the right site with the right fiber proximity and the right connections to where they want to make those connections. But the actual ground lease additional – selling of additional ground space is not going to be that great an opportunity at least with those customer because historically they have always contracted for fairly good sized shelters that are going to be able to house most all that equipment.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you. Great color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Hey, Ric.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Hi, Ric.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. A couple of questions around portfolio growth. I think in the second quarter, Brendan, you mentioned that some of the acquisitions were paid for in stock, almost 0.5 million shares. Can you update us a little bit about was that the buyer asking for that? Was that you? I think it's been a while since you've done some kind of stock compensation for M&A?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. Right. That was a specific transaction where the buyer specifically wanted stock, that was the only option really available to us, but we were obviously actively repurchasing stock as well. So, in fact that you can consider it cash eventually.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah, it was all tax-driven by the buyer.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Tax-driven. Okay. And then, Argentina, Jeff you mentioned obviously, went in there post the quarter. And you mentioned that it could be meaningful growth opportunity. Can you help us kind of size what do you think Argentina might be and then how do you mitigate kind of the FX risk?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, with the 35 towers we've bought have all the carriers on them, and they are predominantly denominated today in U.S. dollars. So, there is a history in Argentina of negotiating and contracting in U.S. dollars. That will be our first choice going forward. I don't know that we will do that a 100% of the time. And where we can't do it, we will do it – we will manage that risk as we do and our other non-U.S. dollar denominated jurisdictions primarily Brazil where we match off expenses. We will look to local debt funding although that has not been an attractive option today although it is one that we are constantly evaluating. And ultimately, we will watch the size of the non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues to come out of a particular spot.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, as you think about the market size for the portfolio in Argentina, is it more buying, is it getting out? You've got a portfolio, you're going to start building, a mix of both? Just trying to think (39:12).
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: There is – one of the reasons we're excited is, it's going to be primarily a longer-term build market that I think a company like ours that has excellent execution capabilities, great financial resources, long-term staying potential will be good at and the customers will recognize. There are three – it's almost uncanny as to the mix of carriers down there. It's almost an equal split between Claro, Movistar and Personal/Nextel. You've got 43 million people, the number of sites is low, and I think, it's somewhere around 16,000 cell sites which seems ungodly low. That sounds too low. I got to relook at – I'm looking at some notes here, but it is a – it's a country that has tremendously underdeveloped wireless. And yeah, it's a great country with great resources and a growing population, and we look at it much the same way that we looked at Brazil. But unlike Brazil, I don't think you're going to have an opportunity to get big quick there because of the – through some tax – because of the way the currency has depreciated down there over time and the way the tax laws work. My understanding is most of the carriers down there, their tower portfolios have been depreciated to almost zero, and the tax hits on the sales or transactions would be unpalatable. And these – obviously these are things that I'm mentioning because these have all been thought of and people have talked about them, and you can imagine that there have been a lot of bankers pitching these three carriers in Argentina to sell their towers, but there are some structural impediments down there that I think are going to make that unlikely, and we'll see. Maybe somebody will figure something out down there. But we're going into Argentina to build towers over a long period of time.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. The last question from me is on U.S. fiber. Obviously, a lot of transactions, all cash deals kind of going on. Can you update us on your thought on small cells, enterprise, fiber, indoor DAS systems? And American Tower mentioned maybe some international opportunity for this, but kind what's your thoughts on fiber and how it might play into the space?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, it's clearly a part of telecommunications infrastructure, but it's an entirely different business, and the fact that it may share some tenants or customers with macro sites doesn't mean it's the same business, because it's not. And I think people have demonstrated that, and people are starting to see that, both from an investment perspective and an overhead perspective, and we'll see over time a return perspective. It is not a business that we believe is necessary for us to maximize the assets that we have and maximize the returns for our shareholders. And we continue to look for exclusive opportunities that may involve fiber. Those would likely come in indoor opportunities, where you have some protectable rights to the real estate and things like that. But we really haven't changed, notwithstanding the amount of activity that has occurred in that space between now and last time we spoke, our views haven't changed.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the update.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Go ahead, please.
Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one. It's been a little over a year since you first laid out your goal of $10 or more in AFFO per share by 2020. As we look over the next few years, what would you say are the biggest sources of potential upside there and what do you view as the biggest or the most relevant risks?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I think organic lease up could provide the most upside. I think, the biggest risk could be FX.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: A significant increase in interest rate...
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. FX and interest rates are the two big risk to the negative, and organic – I mean (44:08).
Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: I guess, if you...
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, yeah, but I...
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: That's more of an upside opportunity.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. Because we based it really on the last couple years. I don't – I see that as much more lever to the upside than I do as a risk to the downside.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. Yeah.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I do think the greater downside risks are the FX and the interest rates.
Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. So, macro stuff is outside of your control?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yes.
Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Hey, guys. So, over the last couple of days there have been a lot of press reports about cable companies partnering and merging with wireless companies. I just want to get your thoughts on how you think about the impact of cable and wireless convergence on your business. And specifically, to what extent would that added capacity from cable alleviate the need for capacity on your towers?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I don't think it does anything because ultimately, what we sell is the radios and the antennas. We sell the thing that turns the signal into the wireless signal that connects with the phone. So, notwithstanding all the fiber that might come with a transaction like that, you still have to have a radio and an antenna on the end of it that turns the signal into what connects with the mobile device, and that's ultimately where our business comes into play.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Got it. And does your mix of – as you're skewed towards rural and suburban towers, play a role in your thought process at all?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah, I think, it's extremely well-positioned for the future because those markets are, I think, best suited to macro site architecture whereas in the more urban markets, you have a lot of different options and where I think a lot of the fiber focus and the cable focus has been.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Go ahead, please.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Two, if I may. The first one, having to do with unlimited. I'm just curious, since all the carriers have come out, guns blazing with their unlimited offerings this year, have you seen any explicit impact with your business? Are they coming to you and explicitly noting maybe anecdotally, or even more specifically in terms of the plan? That is because of the unlimited that they're having to perhaps do more activity than they had otherwise anticipated at this point in the year? And then, secondly, I think all of us on the sell side are always getting asked the differences between the various public tower operators and American, in particular, in this most recent quarter, their growth is up I think about 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. You're holding steady yourself at least in the U.S. I'm just curious, do you have any thoughts for why they might be seeing an acceleration in their business relative to yourself at this point? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. On the first question, Colby, I got to believe the unlimited plays a part in the steadiness of our business and what we believe will be an uptick year as we move into 2018 with the deployments of the additional spectrum. But in terms of coming right out and saying, yeah, we're doing this because of the unlimited plan, no, the conversations are never quite that explicit or specific.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Hey, Colby, on the second question, I can't really speak to how others are calculating their numbers or maybe more impactfully what the potential influence is of the accounting for MLAs. So it's hard for me to draw any real clear comparisons, but we can confidently say that we're not seeing any material variance in activity levels with our key customers that would be – we would be surprised if it was any different from what our peers are seeing. There may be occasional timing differences, but generally speaking, I would expect we'll all see our fair share of future organic growth opportunities.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess there's been some talk about alternative providers of wireless tower services. Let me just comment on that particularly and then also where you see sort of where you stand from a pricing power perspective? And then, thinking about the 600 deployments that you said you're getting some applications now. But just trying to get a sense for when you think the real pace of that will pick up in a meaningful way? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. I think we're just starting to see the beginnings of that, Mike, and obviously it will pick up from here. I can't really pick the quarter where it peaks, but it's well ahead of this, I think. In terms of the alternate providers, I think towers has always been a very entrepreneurial business and people can build towers here and there, and the local person who has the unique knowledge of the real estate where the zoning might lend itself to that can get a tower built. But it's not an easy process in general and in many cases, zoning – in most cases, zoning is going to make it extremely slow and cost prohibitive at best and just outright prohibitive at worst. And if you look at the towers that are out there today, it's taken 30 years to build those towers and it's not because folks didn't want to try and go faster because they did. So, yeah, there will be some other – there always have been folks out there besides the – I'm assuming when you say alternative tower providers, you mean people other than the publics as opposed to like hot air balloons?
Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Correct.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. So, you'll always have that dynamic and there'll be some towers built. And I think you'll definitely see and hear some of that because I think as I mentioned or answered one of the questions earlier, I think you'll have a greater need particularly with FirstNet where you'll have some extremely remote and rural needs where I think you will have to have some new builds and there'll be some new people interested in those.
Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Thanks. Just trying to get some specific timing on the sequence of FirstNet. So, AT&T already said they're going to put it in their CapEx for this year, so we know it's happening in Q4. Do you get the call before or after they ordered the antenna as far as planning for the site?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: We would typically get the call from the turf vendor.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: That's fine. But is the turf vendor calling you to get the site? Or are they calling the guy to buy the antenna first? The vendor as in like a CommScope.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I don't know the answer to that. I mean, they're going to have a pretty good idea of the sites, because I mean the sites are well-known and the inventory of what's on the site is well-known and what its capability is. I don't know Walter what the....
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: I don't know if they know your portfolio?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I don't know what the timing is on the equipment side.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: But chances are if they know your portfolio, the antenna guy gets the call first and then they dial you up and say, okay, we're going to put an antenna or change the antenna on the site.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I mean the applications that would be submitted would be very equipment-specific and therefore antenna-specific. So, whether they've been ordered or not, we wouldn't necessarily know, but we would know what they're exactly planning to use.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Well, they haven't been ordered yet but if they're going to hit CapEx, presumably you're going to get ordered in the fourth quarter.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. And let me answer the question this way. We can move very, very quickly.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Okay. Can I move on to Brazil? Because Telesites today talked about how América Móvil who's got about 18,000 sites in Mexico is building like 1,000 a year. That's just new sites, like new builds as opposed to whatever co-los they're going. And the answer was that they're doing these not for coverage in remote areas of Mexico but dropping them for capacity reasons. So, I'm curious if you're seeing any of that type of activity, meaning an accelerated tower build by América Móvil, Claro in Brazil and also, I know you don't do a lot of builds there, but would you think about changing that since that seems like that might be a strategy for América Móvil going forward?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: You mean smaller-type installations that are more surgical?
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: No. I mean building a new macro tower because there's three other carriers or maybe two with one big K1 (53:44) that would want to add to those sites as they also need to add sites for capacity reasons. Basically, what Telesites said is, América Móvil is not going back splitting towers for capacity because of all this LTE growth that they're having. So, I'm curious if you're seeing that in Brazil and whether you would be willing to build sites for them in Brazil, let alone just adding tenants to your existing portfolio?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, we know América Móvil is active in Brazil. They have been and we know that they're building towers and we do build towers for them. So, I think the answer to all that is, yes.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: I agree. Thanks a lot. Have a great night.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.
Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two if I could. One on Peru and Argentina. Just wondering if there's any incremental SG&A you expect to flow through or do you actually expect to leverage the existing LatAm base of SG&A across these newer markets? And then secondly, on U.S. leasing activity, I think in the past you said new business was about 60%, 40% with more of a skew I guess 60% towards amendments. Has that changed at all in 2Q? Thanks.
Mark C. DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: We will leverage a lot of what we have, Matt, but we will probably be adding initially 10 people or so. I don't know whether it's 8 or I don't know whether it's 12 but, say, 10 between the new countries that will be brand new additions. That will all be covered by the revenue and the cash flow we've picked up. So these markets will be EBITDA positive from day one and a lot of the back office stuff that will be shared based on the strength that we have in the region. I'm sorry, Matt, your second question was on...
Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: The split.
Mark C. DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: The split. Domestically or internationally?
Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Domestically.
Mark C. DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah, domestically. So, we moved closer to 60% – I'm sorry, to just over half this quarter is what I believe we said. So, it's roughly 55% coming from amendments and 45% coming from leases. That is obviously much less from amendments than we've had for the last two years. But I'm not sure that that's necessarily indicative of a longer-term trend. I think it's more the specifics of this particular point in time. So, we would still expect amendments to most heavily be what we see coming over the next couple of years.
Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Mark C. DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: Cathy, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. That will come from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Go ahead please.
Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So, you guys mentioned that absolute level of new leasing activity has increased sequentially for the past few quarters. Should we expect that to continue throughout the rest of 2018? And then, Jeff, maybe on a comment that you had on the new spectrum deployments coming online really focusing more on 2018. You said gross organic leasing activity should pick up. I mean, is that assumption assuming that Metro, Clearwire and Leap lessen in terms impacting results or is that assumption more on the gross organic side? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. It's really all about the true commencement of the 600 megahertz to 2.5G and the FirstNet business, that's what all those comments are based on. And we do think it's just a question of time. None of that is in our 2017 remaining guidance. We do think it's coming, we have talked about and have seen 600 megahertz applications. We've talked about how we approach guidance which we're going to only include things once we've actually booked them and recorded the revenue which has not happened yet. So, it's all coming and we will be reporting it and it will be showing up on our numbers when we receive it, but it's coming.
Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So the $42 million in new leasing activity in 2017, are we looking at a number closer to $50 million in 2018?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: We don't get into next year's guidance until the end of the fourth quarter.
Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call and we look forward to reporting our third quarter results in October.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA 2017 First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, everyone joining by phone is in a listen-only or muted mode. And then, later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the meeting over to our host, Mr. Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark C. DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2017 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, May 1, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our Supplemental Financial Data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn it over to Brendan to comment on our first quarter results.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. The company had another strong financial performance in the first quarter. Our steady performance was once again primarily driven by solid operational performance on the leasing side of our business. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $397.6 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $393.6 million. Better-than-expected foreign exchange rate positively impacted leasing revenue by approximately $1 million, relative to the company's prior expectations for the first quarter. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter was 4.4% over the first quarter of 2016. On a gross basis, the same tower growth was 7.5%. The net same tower growth calculation was negatively impacted by approximately 3.1% of churn. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth, over the first quarter of last year, was 7% on a gross basis and 3.6% on a net basis excluding 3.4% of churn, almost three quarters of which was related to Metro, Leap and Clearwire terminations. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, gross same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 10.8%, exclusive of 50 basis points of churn. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 10.7%. Domestic operational leasing activity in the quarter was slightly ahead of 2016 levels. Approximately 60% of incremental domestic leasing revenue added came from amendments, and the big four carriers represented 88% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue added during the quarter. International leasing activity was consistent with 2016 average levels, with solid contributions from all of our markets. During the first quarter, cash site leasing revenue, denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, was 13.4% of total cash site leasing revenue, the substantial majority of which was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.6% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.8% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. With regard to first quarter churn, we continue to see churn from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire, consistent with our expectations. As of March 31, we have approximately $33 million of annual recurring run rate revenue or less than 2.1% of current total leasing revenue from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire, that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next three years. That's down from $38 million a quarter ago and $50 million at September 30. Domestic churn in the first quarter from all other tenants on an annual same tower basis was less than 1%. We continue to expect domestic same tower churn rate to be in the mid-2% range by the end of the year. The total amount of churn continues to be as expected and is not anticipated to impact our long-term goal of producing $10 or more of AFFO per share in 2020. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $312.3 million. Better-than-expected foreign exchange rates positively impacted tower cash flow by approximately $0.6 million relative to prior expectations. We continue to have success controlling the direct cost associated with our towers, allowing us to continue to have the strongest operating margins in the industry. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 81.9% in the quarter, and international tower cash flow margin was 68%. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $292.2 million. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $0.5 million relative to our expectations. Our strong adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were due to solid results from both our leasing and services businesses. SG&A for the quarter was generally in line with expectations, but up year-over-year due in part to increased costs related to the Oi bankruptcy and other one-time legal costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.7% in the quarter, compared to 70.3% in the year earlier period. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. AFFO in the first quarter was $206.3 million, which amount was positively impacted by approximately $0.6 million relative to prior expectations due to stronger foreign exchange rates. Our industry-leading AFFO per share increased 16.6% to $1.69. Excluding the positive year-over-year impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, AFFO per share increased 13.1% over the year earlier period. We continue to selectively deploy capital towards portfolio growth. In the first quarter, we acquired 90 communication sites for $28.2 million in cash. We also built 58 sites during the first quarter. As of today, we have closed, subsequent to quarter end or have under contract, the acquisition of 181 additional communication sites at an aggregate purchase price of $115.2 million. The sites purchased and built in the first quarter, as well as these additional sites, are located in both domestic and international markets. We continue to invest in the land under our sites, as this is both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. Looking forward, our earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full-year 2017. We've increased the midpoint of our guidance ranges for site leasing revenue by $12 million, tower cash flow by $11 million, and adjusted EBITDA by $10 million. These increases were due to a variety of factors, including: actual first quarter results, revised expectations around forward FX rates, and the impact of acquisitions put under contract since our fourth quarter earnings release. Our updated guidance assumes continued steady operational leasing activity during the remainder of 2017, consistent with the assumptions we made when providing our initial 2017 guidance in February. We've also increased our outlook for AFFO by $7 million at the midpoint, and AFFO per share by $0.04 at the midpoint. The increase in AFFO guidance is due to our higher expected adjusted EBITDA, offset by higher expected net cash interest expense. The increase in net cash interest expense is primarily as a result of our recently closed $760 million securitization financing, which was done at attractive fixed pricing, as well as applying the increased forward LIBOR curve to our interest projections for our floating rate debt. In addition, the recent increase in our share price has resulted in a small increase to our projected weighted average number of diluted shares, negatively impacting our outlook for AFFO per share by approximately $0.02. The updated outlook does not assume any impact from potential acquisitions not under contract as of today, and it does not assume any impact from new financings or repurchases of the company's stock, other than those that have been completed as of today. Although we did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock since our last earnings release, share repurchases have been and, we expect, will remain a critical component of our capital allocation strategy. Our approach to share repurchases remains opportunistic and balanced against portfolio growth. Because we are constantly evaluating potential investments in new asset portfolios, at times we will preserve our liquidity for these potential investments. Such was the case during the first quarter after a big fourth quarter for stock repurchases, but we expect to repurchase additional shares during the remainder of this year. With that, I will turn things over to Mark, who'll provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark C. DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $8.6 billion of net debt. And our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.4 times, within our targeted range of 7 times to 7.5 times. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.9 times. We ended the quarter with $280 million outstanding under our $1 billion revolver, and we have $90 million outstanding as of today. At quarter-end, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt was 3.5% and our weighted average maturity was approximately 4.5 years. On April 17, we issued, through our existing Tower Trust, $760 million of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of April 11, 2022, and a final maturity date of April 9, 2047. The fixed interest rate on the securities is 3.168%. Net proceeds from the offering were used to prepay our $610 million of 2012-1C Tower Securities, which carried an interest rate of 2.933%, as well as accrued and unpaid interest and also for general corporate purposes. As mentioned with our last earnings release on January 12, 2007 (sic) [2017] (12:27), our board of directors approved the authorization of a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan, replacing the prior plan which had a remaining authorization of $150 million. The new plan authorizes the company to repurchase outstanding common stock from time to time at management's discretion and has no time deadline. The full $1 billion is currently available under the new plan. Quarter-end shares outstanding were 121.3 million, down from 125.5 million a year earlier. We're very pleased with our capital structure and believe it maximizes our ability to drive AFFO per share growth. As demonstrated by our recent securitization transaction, SBA continues to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. As you heard from Brendan earlier, we had a very solid start to 2017. A steady demand environment with our customers and strong operational execution not only drove good first quarter results, but also give us increased confidence for a solid 2017 and achieving our goals at least $10 in AFFO per share by 2020. In the first quarter, we posted a very strong 17% year-over-year growth in AFFO per share. Our positive results in the quarter, combined with adjusted expectations for improved foreign exchange rates, have allowed us to increase our full-year 2017 guidance. Even more exciting than the guidance increase is the positive demand backdrop that is developing, which is very encouraging for our long-term goals. In the U.S., operational customer activity, measured as the amount of newly contracted cash revenue per tower, was up slightly from the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in the number of new leases signed, but with the majority of new business still coming in the form of amendments. Organic leasing activity in the quarter remained primarily from the refarming of 2G and 3G spectrum to LTE, as well as some AWS-1 and 700 megahertz deployments. Internationally, we had another steady quarter of operational leasing activity. This activity was approximately 70% from new leases and 30% from amendments in the first quarter. We again had strong contributions from all of our markets, including Brazil, where we continue to see steady results. In addition, Oi remains current with their post-petition rental payments. And we continue to expect all of our Oi leases to remain current as Oi continues to work towards a judicial reorganization. Looking ahead, we continue to feel very good about the environment in which we're operating. Our customers have many things to accomplish over the coming years. Deployments of AWS-3, WCS and 2.5 gigahertz spectrum will all be drivers of future organic leasing activity. In addition, the 600 megahertz option has just wrapped up and the rollout of this spectrum will be another driver of leasing growth over the next few years. Also, since our last earnings call, our largest customer, AT&T, was awarded the FirstNet contract. AT&T, on their recent earnings call, was very clear on all the network deployment coming down the road now that FirstNet has been awarded. While the details as to the specific implications to SBA of this rollout are evolving at this time and we do not anticipate any impact to 2017 financial results, we expect this important nationwide build-out to be a positive contributor to SBA's growth for the next several years. All of the items I mentioned will require a new equipment to be installed at existing and possibly new macro sites, supporting continued steady organic growth. On the expense side, we continue to execute well, driving increased efficiency and cost reductions throughout our organization, as well as continuing to reduce land costs through our active ground lease buyout program. As a result, we remain the industry leaders in tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins, notwithstanding that we are the smallest of the three U.S. public tower companies. These are metrics that we are very proud of. With regard to capital allocation and balance sheet optimization, our approach remains consistent with the strategy we have previously defined. We ended the quarter with 7.4 times net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, within our target range of 7.0 times to 7.5 times. During the quarter, we allocated capital to portfolio growth, adding sites through both new tower builds and acquisitions. This portfolio growth was in both domestic and international markets. Over the last few months, we've been very active in assessing a wide array of portfolio growth opportunities in many different countries. As I've said in the past, there is no shortage of portfolio growth opportunities. We're just hyper-focused on returns and remain committed to allocating capital to the highest return option available to us. It remains our goal and expectation that we will grow our portfolio by 5% to 10% this year, with majority of this growth likely to come internationally. That range of portfolio growth will allow us to continue to be very selective and pick our spots in a global environment of very high bids for tower assets. It will also keep us as a predominantly U.S. macro tower company, which we think is a very good place to be for the next several years. Finally, by staying within that range for portfolio growth, we will have additional capital available for stock repurchase. Share purchases continue to be the benchmark against which all other capital allocation decisions are measured. Our access to debt capital remains very healthy. We recently completed another new financing, locking an attractively priced fixed coupon debt. All of the debt markets we currently finance in remain very open to us for incremental low-cost funds. Our ability to efficiently use our stable cash flows to routinely access secured debt markets optimizes our cost of capital. Our first quarter interest coverage ratio was an extremely healthy 3.9 times. In addition, our liquidity through cash on hand and our $1 billion revolver provides tremendous flexibility and security. We will continue to use our balance sheet to drive increased returns for our shareholders. SBA continues to be a strong performer in a tremendous industry. We continue to have the highest quality assets and produce the highest operating margins in the industry. Continued growth in mobile wireless data demand and the significant network needs of our customers create an environment right for future organic growth. We have tremendous access to capital in order to grow our portfolio and buy back our stock. We are very well-positioned to achieve our goal of at least $10 of AFFO per share by 2020, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. In closing, I'd like to recognize the many contributions of our employees, whose commitment and dedication make our company what it is. We look forward to a successful remainder of 2017. Laurie, with that, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. So I wondered if you could comment a little bit about the pace of leasing and any changes you're seeing from among your top four national customers? And then, with respect to the $10 per share guidance for 2020, I think in the past you've indicated that's based on current drivers. But I wondered what types of acceleration one might begin to contemplate above that target as FirstNet and 600 megahertz start to ramp? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. I don't want to get into specific customer by customer detail, Jonathan, about who's up and who's flat. So I would just as soon leave it at that. In terms of the – and obviously, hopefully, we made it clear this was though in the domestic market and there was a pickup in the aggregate from the four domestic carriers. In terms of what else can help, the 10/20 – I mean obviously organic leasing activity picking up from last year's levels, which is off of which that long-term projection was made, would have a positive effect. Interest rates, currency – not so much M&A necessarily unless it's very cheap or stock repurchases, because we do assume in the model fairly full levels of investment, at least all the way through 2019. So I would say it's really those first three items that I pointed out that could have the most variability on the $10 per share.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And I'm just interested in, as one thinks about site-level Union economics and the contributions that one could see from some of these low-band projects, any kind of initial thoughts as to what that might mean in terms of, say, amendment revenues on your portfolio?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, we're clearly going to get a fair amount of amendment revenue. I can't size it for you just yet. But given the nature of our portfolio, which is primarily non-urban, more suburban and rural, the 600 megahertz, particularly in the hands of T-Mobile, I think will be a great source of new business for us.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. So, Jeff, in the context of the leasing activity and the future discussions, can you just update us on the pricing discussions that you're having? Obviously, some of the carriers have been vocal about their desire to get better terms, better escalators, et cetera. So how is that trending? And perhaps related to that is, can you update us on your lease terms with the various carriers and any opportunity to extend those lease terms? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. In terms of lease pricing, while we don't have any binding contracts with our customers that set pricing, we actually, Simon, have a fairly consistent and predictable pricing structure with all of our clients or whatever it is that they're seeking to do. Now that will evolve as we see more of FirstNet and the 600 megahertz, those specs are not entirely baked yet at this point. But when they do become baked, we will have a price and that price will be very predictable and very consistent. And that's, frankly, the way we've been dealing with our customers for many, many, many years. I am sorry...
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Terms, lease terms.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: The lease terms.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Most of leases are typically five years in length. Some are sometimes 10 years. So we don't have any that go out farther than that. So generally on average they are in the 3-ish year range domestically.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. Now, we still have some time remaining on our old MLAs with T-Mobile and Sprint, which extend that, I believe, four or five years. But not ever having an MLA with AT&T and Verizon, Simon, those are going to average two-and-a-half to three years, which is the constantly rolling over of a series of five-year leases.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. So the escalators you assume in your guidance are pretty consistent to what we've seen in the past?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yes. We're assuming no change in our historical – well, our current escalator that has been essentially in place now for many years...
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Domestically, of course.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: ...domestically, domestically. Yeah. Obviously, it changes internationally where the escalators are based predominantly on CPI.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And I guess, Brazilian inflation is coming down a bit?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: It is, yeah.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I just follow up quick, Brendan, on the buyback. I guess, obviously we saw the new authorization, the stock's really run up from kind of $105 to $125. And I'm wondering if now where the stock is has kind of raised the ceiling and thus lowered the bar for your ability to kind of go out and make good on the 5% to 10% portfolio growth, because although you say confidently you do want to buy back stock, it seems like it would be a lot less attractive to be buying back stock here as opposed to kind of all quarter long. So if you could kind of walk us through how it makes sense to be buying back stock now as opposed to earlier versus the portfolio trade-offs would be kind of helpful. And then just a housekeeping item. I know it's super small, but it looks like there is a new line item in the AFFO calculated to an unconsolidated subsidiary. If you could just elaborate on that a little bit, it would be helpful. Thanks.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Sure. Okay. Yeah, I mean, we still think buybacks are very attractive now for a variety of reasons. One, when you look at our value relative to what we believe intrinsic value to be, it's still a very attractive purchase. The fact that we didn't buy any during the first quarter was driven more by, as we mentioned in our prepared comments, by opportunities for potential portfolio growth that we were evaluating. And in order to preserve liquidity for those potential opportunities, we did hold back on some of the buybacks. But we fully expect to be buying more shares as the year goes on, and we think it's still a very attractive value. And even relative to other companies and where they're valued at, ours is actually I think still arguably a very good buy. So...
David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Could I follow-up on that, Brendan?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah.
David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Have those opportunities that kind of put the buybacks on hold, have those kind of evaporated away or are we still in evaluation mode right now?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: No. Well, there's a mix. Some have gone away and others remain. So I think, going forward, you will see a mix of both buybacks and portfolio growth.
David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Okay. And then your other question was on the item in the AFFO. It's a small item. We did add a line that is related to some very small joint ventures that have begun generating contributions to AFFO. These are basically startup JVs. They wouldn't have contributed – hardly anything in the past, so that's why they weren't there before. But they're immaterial items that we're sort of exploring right now. They're totally related to the tower business though. But beyond that, we don't really want to comment for competitive reasons.
David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Interesting. Thanks, guys.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yes.
Operator: And we'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Your line is open.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and good afternoon, folks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Hey, Amir.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to follow up on sort of – couple of questions around the demand environment. Just in terms of the first quarter demand environment, you had mentioned slightly better and a pickup within the domestic market amongst all four carriers. I was wondering if you could give us some clarity in terms of where that demand is coming from. New spectrum deployment largely driving that, is there any increase in co-location activity? That'd be helpful. And then I've got a brief follow-up.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. Co-los are up relative to where they were probably through most of 2016. I hope we didn't imply or say that all four U.S. carriers were up, because that was not the case. In the aggregate, they were up, but it was not consistent as to where that increase came from. And I'm really not going to get into the specifics of who, what and where. But, in general, it was – so on the co-los, it was some new AWS-3 and 700 megahertz and in other cases, it was also just capacity needs. And I guess, believe it or not, there's still some coverage needs out there as well.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. That's helpful. And then if we're thinking about sort of that growth curve to the $10 target, you had talked about some of those incremental opportunities that are out there at the moment that you're still getting clarification on. But if we think about them as incremental opportunities and we layer in some of the churn reduction expectations that you guys have factored in, it does seem as though that there is a propensity to potentially drive up sort of that AFFO growth off of current levels right now. Is that a fair assumption to be thinking about?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, I think the building blocks to allow that to occur are in place, and we're pleased about that. But certain things have to happen. But I think we're well-positioned to see all that through.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks very much for the incremental color.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Two, if I can. Unsurprisingly, limited upside to domestic guidance at this point in the year, but you sound optimistic on activity overall. We're hearing about some real activity ramping up with other turf vendors. Can we also think that you're optimistic about upside to site development revenue going forward this year, and shouldn't that come through faster than any kind of change in services revenue? And then a separate topic, can you just update us on the situation with Oi? I know you're current, but any update on the reorganization that you're hearing? Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. The site development work does have opportunity for upside, particularly depending on most importantly when the 600 megahertz deployments from T-Mobile start and when the FirstNet, which will now include some AWS-3 and WCS spectrum from AT&T, commences. But you're right, Phil, that's really the first line of recognition. In terms of Oi, Oi continues to work through submitting. And kind of like a tennis ball bouncing over the net, there is a plan that gets proposed by the company and then there is creditor feedback. Creditors in Brazil do not have the ability to submit their own plan, but they do have the ability to comment and provide guidance to whatever current plan management has submitted. Probably the most recent development, which gives us further comfort that all of this will turn out just fine to actually better than the way it used to be, is the government has made several statements about stepping in if they think that in any way the basic Oi service and the impact on consumers would be detrimental. And they have that ability to do that. So at the end of the day, that may be the catalyst that brings this to a resolution and basically moots whatever plan the current shareholders seem to be putting forward.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Okay. And we'll go next to Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. One on the topic of portfolio growth, you just talked about evaluating other opportunities. Can you give us an update on the types of evaluations you've seen in the private market? And then, just as a follow-on to that, did you think about inorganic options. Is it safe to assume macro sites are still the preferred investment or has your view changed at all on small cells given the demand pipeline some of your peers have talked about? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. The prices vary, Matt, and there's still a lot of mid to high-20 times multiples being paid for U.S. tower assets that frankly we know they're not as good as what we own. The blend of what we have under contract and what we've done is the high-teens tower cash flow multiple, which we're happy with. But I also think that's going to be somewhat limiting in terms of our ability to buy everything, because there is a very high bid out there, as I mentioned, for both domestic and U.S. tower assets. So we're doing what we've done for close to 20 years now, which is buy things in smaller packages, use our long-term relationships in history to find things that others can't and really work hard to find the best assets for the best price. We continue to be focused on macro sites. I mean, you used the word small cells, but really what small cells is, is fiber. And our shareholders want us to be a tower company. So we are very much focused on that. We will continue to look at exclusive pieces of real property where we might have some advantages that could lead to small cells, but to move into the fiber business is not something that we're pursuing today.
Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And if I could just follow-up on the portfolio growth, it sounded before like you feel pretty confident in getting back to that 5% to 10% portfolio growth target. So just given the valuations that you're seeing out there in terms of private market portfolio, is that still the case that you think you can get back to that 5% portfolio growth for this year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I do.
Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Maybe just a few questions for Brendan. You mentioned legal costs in the first quarter. I was wondering if you could just break those out? Secondly, can you just provide to us what the additional upside would be using today's FX spot rate as opposed to what's in your guidance? And then, lastly, can you just remind us what the incremental investment capacity is for the remainder of the year relative to your target leverage? Thanks.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. The legal costs that I mentioned were really just to highlight that we actually had some one-time items that had to do with specific litigation, and that's why we had a little bit of a spike in SG&A. It's in the $300,000 to $400,000 range. But it's an item though we don't expect to repeat. There is nothing otherwise special about it. As it relates to the FX impact, basically for every $0.05 change in the Brazilian to U.S. dollar exchange rate beyond what we have assumed in our guidance, you would have about a $2.5 million change in the revenue line for the balance of the year. And it would be a $1.5 million approximately down to the EBITDA and AFFO lines. So if you take where we are today, we're roughly about $0.10 difference from where the actual spot rates are versus our projection. So basically twice those amounts would be the impact. And then, do you want to -
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Capacity, on a look forward 12-month basis is in excess of $1 billion. I mean, you look at the AFFO projections, you look at where we would take leverage at 7.5 – or where we could leverage additional EBITDA growth at 7.5 times and I think you get to well above that number.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Just to follow-up on that, Jeff. Even if I look at you getting to your 5% portfolio growth just based on rough averages of what you're paying, it's still implied that there would be, quite frankly, a significant buyback likely some point between now and the end of the year. Is that a fair way of thinking about it or am I missing something?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: If all we do is 5% on the portfolio growth, you're right.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Our intent – I mean I can't tell you today which of those two it's going to be, but I can tell you we're going to stay at the high-end of our target leverage range. And then, the math kind of falls out from there depending on whether you spend it on portfolio growth or stock repurchases. So...
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: So do you think you're going to be at the 7.5 times versus 7 times by, call it, year end?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. I don't think we're looking to bring leverage down in this environment. I think we're looking to stay exactly where we've been in the last couple years.
Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Amy Yong with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, thanks. So two questions, just following up on the portfolio strategy. Should we assume, given the commentary, that what you're looking at is all on the LatAm side? And then, secondly, can you talk about – I know this is small – but how much the newly acquired sites would add to revenue and AFFO? Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, I don't know that we can give you an exact number on that, but I think you could back into it by using a high-teens tower cash flow multiple against the purchase price for those assets, and there you'll have your TCF number. And in terms of the...
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, we – if you look at – there is a bridge that we've included in our Supplemental package, which has our bridge of revenue growth. And you can see how much is being contributed by non-organic sources, which is primarily acquisitions, also includes new builds. Since the last earnings release that we did in February, we've increased the amount being contributed to revenue from those items by $5 million. That basically represents acquisitions that have been put under contract or closed since then that weren't under contract at the time that we gave that guidance. So we don't give projections for anything we don't have under contract though.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: And in terms of our appetite, it's going to remain predominantly, if not exclusively, in the western hemisphere.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.
Nicholas Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. As the carriers have talked about deploying AWS-3 on antenna that also support AWS-3, which makes sense since they're adjacent bands, and also deploying 600 megahertz on combined 600 megahertz, 700 megahertz antennas. Assuming they go that route, and those bands, can it be deployed with more antenna swaps rather than new antenna raise. How is that going to affect the degree to which you can monetize their deployments relative to the past deployments? And I know you guys are careful about including equipment schedules in your leases to protect against that stuff. Can you tell us about what share your leases have to those schedules?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, pretty much a 100%, other than some legacy leases that we picked up when we bought the mobility portfolio, where T-Mobile has some broader equipment rights. But beyond those 2,000 sites for that particular customer, everything, Nick, is equipment-specific. What will actually drive the answer to that question is, does the swap bring with it any increase in weight or size, weight or wind load, in which event we will surely most likely monetize that. And then the next question is, if it does not come – and we think it'd be very few and far between where the scenario that you painted does not bring about some increase in weight or wind load, but assume that it does. Then, we will look at the specifics of that site where it is, what the customer's already paying, and we may allow that to occur for free. I've talked for a year plus now about how we kind of manage our relationship with our customers. And while we do have the legal right to charge for every change-out, whether it increases the load or not, we sometimes don't do that just because we continue to be good partners.
Nicholas Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one more. You've been decommissioning about 50 towers a quarter in the U.S. over the last several years. So that was originally related to iDEN decommissioning, just some single-tenant sites. But how much longer that has to run before the decommissioning just go back to a more – to a smaller number?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. I think you'll see them start to come down in the not too distant future. But it's not just iDEN, it also does include some sites that are naked that used to have Metro or other – or Clearwire, other ones that are related to consolidation related terminations. So depending on our evaluation of those particular sites and how comfortable we are as to whether or not they'll be able to add incremental revenues. In some cases, we feel it's a better decision to save on the costs and to decommission the tower. So it has been a little bit higher recently. But I think as we get a year or so out, you'll start to see that come down.
Nicholas Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question from Walt Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Thanks. The $42 million on slide 4, can I assume that does not include any FirstNet, 600 megahertz, WCS, et cetera?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Correct. That's correct.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Roger that. The Comcast won 600 megahertz, have you heard from them yet?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Brief conversations, nothing that would cause us to change any of our outlook.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Check. And then, lastly, there was one operator that was really talking of wireless backhaul. I am wondering if you've seen any activity anywhere in the market with regard to wireless backhaul, maybe even some aggregation pointing in your own towers.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. We've seen a fair smattering of dishes, microwave dishes. It's still...
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Not microwave, I was thinking more of 2.5 wave.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: That is we think still yet to break out.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Imagine that... All right, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we go next to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. You, in the past, haven't used MLAs or holistic agreements as much as some of the other operators. And when you've done it, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you've done it usually because there was some degree of complexity associated with activities at that operator and it felt like an efficient way of dealing with it. I'm curious whether you think that FirstNet or any of the other projects that we've been talking about could potentially fall into that complex bucket. And if so, could you just sort of remind us ultimately what are you looking for out of a holistic agreement to sort of be at a point of indifference as to whether you'd do that or do everything à la carte?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: We would basically, Brett, be looking for equipment specificity, and that was really the key component of the couple of MLAs that we did do. I mean, we have no trouble agreeing to things like escalators and prices for certain specs. And it's where there is some lack of specificity about what someone may be able to do on the tower within a certain space on the tower that is something that philosophically we have never agreed to.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And so, in terms of...
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: And most – well, you could possibly get to all of those specificities in any deployment.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And I was also curious whether things like longer term revenue visibility matter. You're trying to get to over $10 a share of AFFO by a certain date, that relies in part on being able to continue to re-lever your balance sheet. Do you think that you can get better borrowing costs if you showed up and said, hey, I have this 10, 15, whatever year MLA, or do you think it sort of is irrelevant? And then just one other quick question. You mentioned that you are paying these high-teens multiples for portfolios. One of the stories that emerged over the last year or so is that some of the private operators were accepting lower escalators. Are you buying those towers?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: We might have bought some with lower escalators. We would not have bought any that had non-specific equipment leases.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: And what was the question...
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just in terms of – does the ability to have longer term revenue visibility, particularly when you're trying to achieve a certain level of AFFO per share, does that help in terms of being able to access the credit markets or is that not a big factor in why you would do an MLA?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I mean, it's a slight positive, but you'd have to weigh that against what you're giving up. I mean, the way you account for the typical MLA, it really has a nice benefit in the first year and then it starts to not, depending on how it's structured, look so good once you lap that first year. So you have to kind of be careful about that. But, I mean, we have operated the business, Brett, ever since we started on the basis of trying to anticipate the level of activity that our customers are actually going to enjoy. And we've tried to not alter that to either someone's gain or loss through MLA contracts.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We go next to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So you sound much more positive on, I guess, your backlog of activity and just general activity levels in the U.S., but your domestic guidance for new leasing activity only increased by $1 million. So I'm trying to understand, are you assuming that...
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Let me help you with that.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Sure.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: We're only going to increase our guidance based off of the results we just report, not on any prospective change in view.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Got it. So you're basically just baking in the outperformance in Q1, not really changing your assumptions for the next three quarters. Is that the right way to think about it?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yes, it is.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Awesome. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We go next to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Couple left on the list here. Lot of discussion on one-climb is coming up. AT&T talked about doing a one-climb to bring up three type of frequencies. Just today on their call, that we were on, talked about maybe working with incumbents and doing one-climb with either T-Mobile with broadcast or with AT&T and Verizon with their AWS-3. How does the one-climb concept work on the services side and on the leasing side, particularly if it's different people trying to share that one-climb?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: It's got to be a long climb. You pay tower climbers by the day, they're typically hourly paid workers. And it's always going to be cheaper than two separate trips, because you've got mobilization costs and the basic time it takes to get up the tower. Once they're there, they can do more. So you would split the costs where it's obvious as to who the work is being done for. But there is going to be a substantial amount of services work and revenue that comes out of all this, but it will be more efficient. So I think you'll see more business to the folks who provide those services, and you'll also see lower per unit costs for our customers.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then on the leasing side, if DISH were the one to climb up together with an AT&T or T-Mobile, how would you think about the rents then?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, they'd either be paying their own rent with a new co-lo or they would have had to have cut a deal with one of those similar to what was contemplated in the old Sprint-LightSquared way and what is likely to be contemplated with the AT&T-FirstNet deployment. You either have to commit under an existing tenancy or you have to create a new tenancy.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Makes sense. And I think last year you guys saw a little head fake maybe about lease applications not turning into executed applications, maybe a year plus ago now. Are you seeing any uptick in applications that haven't turned into executed and is your guidance based on executed or lease-out kind of flow?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: The guidance is based on where we enjoyed the outperformance in Q1 and holding everything else the same. And we do remember that head fake, and that's not something we're going to repeat.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: We appreciate it. Last question from me. On the SG&A, it was I think about $34 million in the quarter. Brendan, you mentioned may be less than $0.5 million out of run rate. So should we think $33 million is kind of more than normal, that was what we had I guess in fourth quarter as well as first quarter if we normalize out for that?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. That's probably right. I mean obviously there's FX impact there, Ric.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: And there's also a chunk of that that is non-cash related, such as non-cash comp. And so, when you look at it, the contribution to EBITDA isn't that full amount. But, yes, for the balance of the year anyway it should be relatively steady. Actually, let me back up on that for a second, because the first quarter is actually usually a touch higher because we do have elevated payroll taxes and things of that nature.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. It should be lower than that.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: It'll probably be a little bit lower, but there are other items that tick up. So I think next quarter it'll actually be lower.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. I was just trying to size it. And then speaking of size, the M&A deals that you avoided buyback since your last earnings call, but did some in the quarter, what sort of size portfolio should we think you guys are looking at. Is it the whole gamut, is it still looking in the $5 million to $50 million range or the $100 million to $200 million range. Just trying to size the portfolio question?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. It's really the gamut. There is a wide variety of opportunities and size transactions out there. And we probably will do better, at least our experience was, where we since secure these – the least the competitive bid process, the better pricing that we're going to get. And we're trying to get as many of those as we can.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Appreciate it. And glad you guys aren't looking at head fakes this year. So that all makes me feel good. Thanks.
Operator: Thanks. We'll go to Mike Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question. As you look internationally at LatAm operations, as it would seen some of the FX gyrations are settling down and maybe there is more clarity on an operating side. And how would you look at trying to get more scale for those operations through partnerships, maybe a divestiture or even considering new acquisitions? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I mean all of what you just said, Mike, is true. We have an increasingly positive view on all parts of LatAm, and we would be open and looking to any of those opportunities. We'll be as creative and a smart around this as the opportunities present themselves.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Jeff, thank you for taking the question. I just had a bigger picture question. As we look out into 5G architecture, I think most would say small cells and fiber and we touched on the fiber issue. But also macros, a case could be made macros become increasingly important as they really represent the core. And as more of the CRAM and those acronyms take shape that the macro tower with fiber lead back to it becomes all the more important. I guess, one, would you agree with that view? And then, secondly, as we look out five to seven years, do you see more pricing power coming for the macro owners because of that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I do agree with that basic premise, Jennifer, and it's good to hear from you. Our portfolio is, as you well know, it's predominantly rural and suburban. And all the conversations around 5G and small cells has really pretty much been concentrated around the urban markets, where you can easily draw the picture of the millimeter wave spectrum and the fiber-fed units, that really doesn't have practical application outside of the urban market. So we are very confident that we are going to play a very critical role in 5G in the areas where we currently have towers. We don't expect for a minute, because it just simply won't work, as a service offering that 5G is limited to urban market. It will, of course, be rolled out to the suburban and urban markets just as all generations have been, and we will participate in that. And in terms of pricing power, I don't know that the G moniker necessarily increases or decreases the pricing power. I mean our business has always enjoyed, because of the exclusive nature of the assets, pricing power, which is why we are able to produce the margins that we have and the growth that we have. Now the object is to balance that against the needs and the health of our customers who we want to succeed to the greatest financial extent possible because with that financial success on their part, we think it all comes back to the network. So I agree with everything you said. And I think that as we move to 5G, it will really be just one more continuation of the course of dealings that we've had over the years.
Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much, Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. And I'll turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I want to thank everyone for joining us. And we look forward to our second quarter results call. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today. Thank you for participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. The company has finished the year with another strong financial performance. We were in the upper half of our guidance ranges for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO even with negative impact from unfavorable moves in foreign currency as compared to the assumed rates we used when setting guidance. Our solid performance was primarily driven by operational outperformance on the leasing side of our business. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $393.6 million and cash site leasing revenues were $386.9 million. Weaker than expected foreign exchange rates negatively impacted leasing revenue by approximately $800,000 relative to guidance. Operational leasing activity during the quarter was as expected and in line with activity levels seen throughout 2016. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter was 4.8% over the fourth quarter of 2015. On a gross basis, the same tower growth was 7.5%. The net same tower growth calculation was negatively impacted by 2.7% of churn. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 7% on a gross basis, and 4% on a net basis, excluding 3% churn over two thirds of which was related to Metro, Leap and Clearwire decommissioning. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, gross same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 11.6%. Exclusive of 40 basis points of churn, most of which was from one narrow band customer in Canada. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 11.5%. As mentioned, operational leasing activity in the quarter remained steady and as expected. Approximately 70% of incremental domestic leasing revenue added came from amendment and the big four carriers represented 88% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue added during the quarter. International leasing activity was up sequentially over the third quarter with solid contributions from all of our markets. During the fourth quarter cash site leasing revenues denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars was 12.2% of total cast light leasing revenue. The substantial majority of which was from Brazil with Brazil representing 11.5% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 7.9% of cast site leasing revenue excluding revenues from path through expenses. With regard to our fourth quarter churn, we saw a sequential increase over Q3 and the amount of churn from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire, which we expect to see continue into early 2017. As of December 31, we have approximately $38 million of annual recurring run rate revenue or approximately 2.4% of current total leasing revenue from leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to turn off over the next three years. That's down from $50 million a quarter ago as a result of fourth quarter churn. Based on termination requests received to date, we anticipate the impact of consolidation churn from these customers to be its greatest in the first half of 2017. We expect domestic same tower churn rates in the mid 3% range in the first quarter of 2017, but we expect that rate to be in the mid 2% range by the end of the year. And by the end of 2019, we expect that our domestic churn rate will be back in a 1% to 1.5% range consistent with the level of non-consolidation churn we've experienced throughout our history. Regardless of the timing, the total amount of this consolidation churn continues to be as expected and is not anticipated to impact our long-term goal of producing $10 or more of AFFO per share in 2020. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $308.4 million. Weaker than expected foreign exchange rates negatively impacted tower cash flow by approximately $0.5 million relative to guide. The outperformance in tower cash flow relative to guidance came primarily from successful efforts around controlling the direct costs associated with our tower. The quality of our assets in our lease agreements and our excellence in execution allow us to continue to have the strongest operating margins in the industry. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 82% in the quarter and international tower cash flow margin was 68.7%. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $287 million. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $0.4 million relative to guidance. The solid adjusted EBITDA results in the quarter were a result of the outperformance in tower cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 70% in the quarter compared to 69.1% in the year earlier period. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. AFFO in the fourth quarter was $201.3 million which amount was negatively impacted by approximately $0.5 million relative to guidance due to foreign exchange rates weaker than anticipated. Our industry leading AFFO per share increased 14% to $1.63. Excluding the positive year-over-year impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, AFFO per share increased 11.9% over the year earlier period. When further adjusted to exclude the year-over-year decline of $7.2 million in services margin, AFFO per share increased 16.1% on a constant currency basis over the year earlier period adding to our confidence in achieving $10 or more of AFFO per share in 2020. We continue to selectively deploy capital towards portfolio growth. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 215 communication sites for $73.5 million in cash. We also built 118 sites during the fourth quarter, moving our total site count to over 26,000. These additional sites are located in both domestic and international markets. We continue to invest in the land under our sites as this is both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $20.2 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years, the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is approximately 33 years. Looking forward, our earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2017. Our initial guidance assumes continued steady operational leasing activity on a contracted cast revenue added per tower basis in each of our markets as well as similar levels of services business to that which we experienced in 2016. The outlook does not assume any impact from potential acquisitions not under contract as of today and it does not assume any impact from new financings or repurchases of the company's stock other than those that have been completed as of today. We have assumed a weakening FX environment in 2017 consistent with average forecasts of a number of large financial institutions and as disclosed in today’s earnings press release. Consistent with our intention to align our public communications with the long-term approach we take internally in managing the business, the company will no longer be providing guidance for quarterly results. We believe disproportionate focus on immaterial quarterly variances takes away from the steady stable long-term returns the company will produce by achieving our goal of $10 or more of AFFO per share by 2020. However in order to provide incremental details around our full-year outlook as well as selective historical information, we have added a number of new slides to our supplemental financial data package that I encourage you to review. These slides include both historical and forward-looking information including a bridge from our 2016 site leasing revenue to the midpoint of our 2017 site leasing revenue guidance and a detailed portion of our 2016 site leasing revenue that represents the core recurring cash leasing revenue from our base leasing business. This core recurring cash leasing revenue is the base upon which we calculate our same tower leasing revenue growth. The new slide also includes historical same tower year-over-year growth rates and churn rates for the last two years. The historical churn disclosure reflects the steady level of regular non-Metro, Leap and Clearwire churn over the last couple of years as well as the recent increase in the consolidation churn from these customers. Finally, we provided a breakdown of our historical capital allocation, which demonstrates our consistent approach to maintaining target leverage levels and fully investing in our business primarily through either acquisitions or stock repurchases. Including a significant share repurchases we completed during the fourth quarter of 2016 taking advantage of buying our stock at historically low valuations. We continue to believe our approach to balance sheet structure and wide capital allocation has created material value throughout our history. With that I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $8.7 billion of net debt, and our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.6 times, just above our targeted range of 7 to 7.5 times. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was improved in very strong 3.8 times. We ended the quarter with $390 million outstanding under our $1 billion revolver, and we have $295 million outstanding as of today. At quarter-end, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt was 3.5% and our weighted average maturity was approximately 4.5 years. On January 20th, we entered into an amendment to reprice both of our outstanding senior secured term loans from LIBOR plus 250 basis points with a LIBOR floor of 75 basis points to the new pricing of LIBOR plus 225 basis points with a zero LIBOR floor. This pricing was done at par and will reduce our 2017 net cash interest expense by approximately $4.9 million. During the quarter and subsequent to quarter-end, we cumulatively spent $347.7 million to repurchase 3.4 million shares of common stock at an average price per share of $103.08, reducing our outstanding share count by 2.7%. On January 12, 2017 after these repurchases, our Board of Directors approved the authorization of a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan replacing the prior plan, which had a remaining authorization of $150 million. The new plan authorizes the company to repurchase outstanding common stock from time to time at management's discretion and has no time deadline. The full $1 billion is currently available under the new plan. Quarter end shares were $121.0 million down from 125.7 million shares a year earlier. We’re very pleased with our capital structure and believe that maximizes our ability to drive growth in AFFO per share. As demonstrated by our recent repricing transaction, SBA continues to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets. With that I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening everyone. As you heard from Brendan earlier, we had another solid quarter. We continued to see steady demand in our site leasing business both domestically and internationally and we continue to operate our towers with a level of efficiency that has produced industry leading tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins. We produced 14% year-over-year growth in AFFO per share positively contributing to achieving our goal of at least $10 of AFFO per share by 2020. Our strong growth in AFFO per share was favorably impacted and will continue to be impacted by solid organic leasing growth, sound capital allocation and optimal management of our capital structure. During the quarter, we allocated capital to both portfolio growth and stock repurchases. We materially impacted our outstanding share count last year by buying in 4.3% of our outstanding shares most of which was in the fourth quarter. For the year, we returned $550 million to our shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. We were able to reduce our weighted average cost of debt through our refinancings completed in the third quarter and the successful repricing of our existing term loans in January. All of which demonstrate SBA’s very positive position and reputation as an issuer in the debt capital markets. Our success in these areas helped us to produce the highest AFFO per share in the industry and AFFO per share growth will remain a key focus for us going forward. In the U.S., operational customer activity measured as the amount of newly contracted cash revenue per tower remained steady with the majority of new business coming in the form of amendments, which we expect to continue to be the case throughout 2017. Organic leasing activity in 2016 was primarily from the refarming of 2G and 3G spectrum to LTE as well as some AWS-1 and 700 megahertz deployments. Our initial 2017 guidance contemplates the same level of gross leasing activity as we experienced in 2016 at least for now. Our backlogs are pretty healthy and we do have a number of opportunities for additional growth this year and over the next few years. These opportunities include the increased deployment of new spectrum bands such as AWS-3, WCS and 2.5 gigahertz and even longer-term 600 megahertz. At some point, we will also see the deployment of Dish spectrum as well as the commencement of the FirstNet rollout. All of these deployments will require new equipment to be installed at existing and possibly new macro sites supporting steady organic growth for years to come. In addition, potential regulatory changes such as a rollback of net neutrality and corporate tax reform would positively impact our customers improving their net cash flow and therefore their ability to materially further invest in their wireless networks. Such an environment would be positive for us and would further support steady continued growth of our revenue base. Internationally, we had our best quarter all year in terms of operational leasing activity. This activity was approximately 63% from new leases and 37% from amendments in the fourth quarter. We had strong contributions from all of our markets and Brazil continues to see steady results. Oi remains current with their post-petition rental payments and continues to work towards a judicial reorganization. As indicated in the past, we remain actively engaged in the process and anticipate more clarity in the next several months as always submit to its new reorganization plan. We continue to expect all of our Oi leases to be reaffirmed. During the fourth quarter, we continue to grow our portfolio throughout all of our markets including acquisitions in the U.S., Brazil and Chile. We intend to continue to grow both domestically and internationally with continued primary focus on the western hemisphere, but remaining open to opportunities worldwide. We believe a number of attractive opportunities to add assets remain throughout the Western Hemisphere and we are fully engaged in identifying those opportunities that will provide the strongest return on invested capital. We produced a significant amount of free cash flow every year and we have open access to the debt markets. We intend to stay fully invested within our target leverage range at 7.0 to 7.5 times adjusted EBITDA. When we are not able to identify asset opportunities that meet our return requirements in order to fully utilize our available investment capacity, we will continue to supplement our portfolio investments with opportunistic share repurchases. Staying fully invested should give us good opportunities to increase our AFFO per share guidance throughout the year. Our progression toward electing REIT status continues to be on track. In January, we completed the merger of SBA Communications Corporation into a wholly owned subsidiary in order to facilitate our compliance with certain REIT rules. This merger allowed us to adopt certain charter provisions that implement standard REIT ownership limitations and transfer restrictions related to our stock. Our only remaining step now is to formally elect REIT status when we file our 2016 tax return. Because we have been functionally operating as a REIT since prior to 2016, we expect our election to be nothing more than a formality with the operations of the company continuing as business as usual. We currently intend to use our net operating loss carry-forward positions for tax purposes to eliminate any distribution requirements, which we currently expect will be the case at least through the end of 2020. As a result at this time, we are not planning on any changes to our capital allocation strategy. SBA continues to be a very special company. We produced the highest AFFO per share in the industry, almost all of which is from cash revenues from the leasing of macro site towers. We have the highest quality assets, very carefully put together over two decades. We also operate the most efficiently as demonstrated by our industry leading operating margins. Our strategic vision remains the same, maximize organic revenue growth, minimize expenses, pursue attractive portfolio growth and keep the balance sheet optimized. Looking ahead, new spectrum deployments, the rise of mobile video and the push towards 5G will continue to drive organic growth. And when opportunities arise, we will have the liquidity and financial flexibility to grow our portfolio and buyback our stock. All of these factors give us tremendous optimism about the long-term future of SBA including our ability to achieve our goal of $10 or more of AFFO per share by 2020. We appreciate the contributions of our employees and our customers during 2016 and we look forward to a successful 2017. And with that Laurie, we’re now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question from Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Rick Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon guys.
Jeff Stoops: Hey, Rick.
Rick Prentiss: Hey, two if I could. First I appreciate the information on the stock buyback, the new authorization. How should we compare fourth quarter where you did a lot of buybacks with I guess the first two months of first quarter where you haven't done a lot? How should we think about the pacing then of that buyback as you look at leverage and refinancings and also acquisitions?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I mean we obviously haven't done anything in the first two months or we would have told you about it that was largely a function of where we ended the year at 7.6 times. We'll go a little higher than that maybe for the right opportunities, which we did I think once or twice last year, but the 7.5, 7.6 quarter ending leverage is really where we're targeting to be during this period of time. So, obviously, we didn't do any in the first two months, but you certainly ought not to take that as an indication of where the rest of the year is going to go particularly when you kind of model in our stated goals of keeping the balance sheet leveraged at 7 to 7.5 times looking out our EBITDA guidance and what our availability of capital will be.
Rick Prentiss: Second question, we take a look at that supplement that Brendan was talking about and obviously a lot of really good stuff in there; had a question if I could on maybe some of the details there. You talked about the recurring cash leasing revenue. And should we use those numbers to look at what the percent growth is for new leasing activity in escalators and churn is that what you're suggesting?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, yes. And that that is also you should reckon that is consistent with how we've done it throughout our history. So part of the goal here was to provide a little more of the detail behind those same tower growth calculations. So now you can take the leasing activity, the escalations and even the churn and you have to abate on which those percentages are calculated.
Rick Prentiss: And then on that quarter recurring cash leasing number, there are a couple items in there that you're calling out: one managed and non-macro business and other miscellaneous items. And there was obviously some downward drafts in 2016 from your book revenue to your core cash. Can you just help us to understand what’s in those managed and non-macro and other miscellaneous items?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So the summary they're all down draft because they're all items that make up total revenue, but we exclude from core recurring cash leasing revenue. The managed and non-macro is almost entirely our managed rooftops and lease – sublease business that we've had for many, many years. We have about 500 or so revenue producing rooftops that we managed that’s the majority of that particular item. The other miscellaneous items is kind of a mix of a variety of things includes cash basis revenues out of period revenues where we maybe get paid for something and recognize it in, in a particular period, but it relates to six months or something. So it's not really representative of that quarter's revenue terminations fees other miscellaneous fees that we might collect from tenant is that kind of stuff. And that can vary up or down a little bit in any given period. So we feel that it's appropriate to exclude that because it's not really representative of a recurring type item at least on those particular sites.
Rick Prentiss: And that's also why you've done the amortization of the capital contribution what we call augmentation reimbursements also being pulled out.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes that's being removed because although we do get paid that money, these are all real revenue items, but because it's more of a one-time event that doesn't recur we remove it just like the miscellaneous items in order to give you a true view on what the organic growth rates look like.
Rick Prentiss: In 2017 guys assume somewhat of 2016 growth so whether your peers said they expect to see a pick up and they've seen a pick up in apps. You guys are not putting that into your guidance yet.
Brendan Cavanagh: We're not including that in guidance.
Rick Prentiss: Very good thanks. Thanks guys.
Operator: Then we will go to Jonathan Schildkraut with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great a couple questions if I may. First you guys definitely took a conservative stance on the FX side. I was wondering if you might give us a little color as to what the outlook might look like or what might add to the outlook rather if we were to assume sort of spot rates? And then the second question I had was – I was wondering if we could get some perspective from your perch as to what some of the potential catalysts might look like as they ultimately rollout on to towers? And specifically I'd be interested in your views as to FirstNet and 5G and whether that at all changes your perspective on the portfolio of assets that you might want to own over the longer-term? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: John, on the FX question, your spot rate today is around 3.11 or so in Brazil that’s the bulk obviously of our FX impact. We've assumed an increasing rate throughout the year that average is 3.32. So the difference if we had the spot rate throughout the balance of the year would be approximately $12 million of revenue and somewhere around $7 million or so on the TCF and EBITDA lines.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, Jonathan, this is Jeff. On the FirstNet, we continue to anticipate an early to no later than mid summer award, I believe the only reason it's being held up so far is there was a challenge to the process, which I do believe is working self-through. We believe they're going to want to go pretty quick at that point. And at this time while we haven't seen the final specs yet, we do believe that these specs will consist of adding lines and antennas that the existing rad center to whoever the partner is that gets picked for the project. And that will be sectorized, so you’re looking at three lines, three antennas type thing. There is still some talk out there that the deployment would come in the form of a separate rad center. While that would be better for us given the amount of tower capacity that would take, we're not putting any stock in that until we actually see what's coming out exactly. And regardless of what I just said in the timing, none of that is really in our guidance for 2017. In terms of 5G, there's obviously a lot of talk about that, and not a lot is known for sure. We've talked to a number of folks though both at the equipment side and at the customer side and there's not been anyone who thinks that the millimeter wave spectrum is going to be utilized outside the urban markets. So we believe that just like 4G which rolled out nationwide, 5G will be two and it will use the macro sites to do that probably with spectrum that may exist today. And certainly not exclusively the millimeter wave type spectrum that you may see used more exclusively in the urban markets. And we do know based on everything we've heard that to achieve the gains and quality speed latency and all the other things that 5G will bring that it will require new radios and new antennas even if existing spectrum is utilized. So that's what we believe today and we expect as time goes on to have more specificity around that.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thanks for taking my questions.
Jeff Stoops: Sure.
Operator: We'll go to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Mike McCormack: Yes, thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on what you're seeing out there as far as any impact on your growth with respect to small cell deployments whether or not there is overlap that you might be losing business with. And secondly maybe Jeff just a comment regarding the proliferation of over the top and unlimited data offerings. When do we think we can see sort of a pull through to create better growth in the U.S.?
Jeff Stoops: So I think you're going to start seeing increased network stress. I don't think anybody would or could argue otherwise with that. I mean one of the things that will happen with the unlimited plans is people will be less inclined to even think about transitioning over to WiFi when its available. So you have a lot of – you have a lot more spectrum or a lot more capacity run through the cellular networks. Now as it has always been in our industry, Mike, the question will be where do our customers want to invest the money and how much money do they have to invest. I don't think there's ever been any issue about the operational needs for continued network investment, but they run businesses as we do and you know you have to justify the investment. That's really the bigger issue in my opinion as opposed to will the operational needs be there, which we think are absolutely clear. So on the small cell side, there's – we've seen absolutely no overlap in our business from a negative way. We actually have leased out some small cell spaces on our towers at the 60-ish foot level, which is not an area that we've typically used all that is great. So, operationally, we've seen no overlap and no cannibalization. But again you may have issues where carriers depending on the area. We'll deploy more money in one area for small cell and more money for macro in a non-urban market. But keep in mind we've never really been an urban company. So the architecture is not changing where we are. And we’ve not seen any indication that our customers are bringing products and speeds to urban markets that they're not eventually going to bring nationwide.
Mike McCormack: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go to David Barden with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Josh Frantz: Hi, guys. It’s Josh Frantz in for Dave. Thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate the comments on the churn. I wonder if you could talk about kind of the escalators amendments in churn and the shape of that on the international side for the year and kind of going forward that would be helpful. Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Sure, yeah, so actually if you look at one of the new slides that we included, which is the first slide in the supplemental deck that we've posted on our website, its a bridge of our 2016 leasing revenue to the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, but we've broken it down into not just consolidated numbers, but also domestic and international. And so if you look at the International, there you'll see the contributions that are being made or that we assume will be made in our guidance from each of those categories in new leasing activity: the escalators and the churn. And I think if you look at that you'll see that the escalator pieces is the bigger component driving the growth that's roughly 6.5% on a same tower basis off of that core base of revenue. And a lot of that is carried by Brazil and the fact that inflationary rates drive escalators. The churn is basically almost nothing. We show about $1 million year-over-year down and that's really a vestige of some smaller items, but really there's no churn to speak of. So we expect to continue to see pretty steady activity there. The leasing activity from an operational lease up standpoint in the fourth quarter internationally was very strong. It was stronger than our third quarter, so we've seen some steady improvement. And we expect to have a fairly steady year year-over-year for 2017 over 2016 from that standpoint.
Josh Frantz: Great and any anything into the next few years that we should be aware of on that same kind of topic?
Jeff Stoops: Not internationally. I mean domestically you're going to see a big drop off in the Metro, Leap and Clearwire churn as we move through the year, but we think we've talked about that quite a bit.
Josh Frantz: Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: And we will go to Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Great, just to follow up on that question. What was comparable to that 6.5% international escalator that you’re expecting in 2017 as when we look at 2016? And then also you in the past talked about portfolio growth in recent years, 5% to 10% I think in 2016 is closer to maybe 4%. Any color on expectations for 2017 including anticipated new builds? And then also I just wanted to ask one question Jeff. Just broadly speaking there's a lot of talk now about fixed wireless as part of 5G. AT&T and Verizon in particular doing trials, other companies whether it's a Google or [indiscernible] in Boston and so forth looking to get more involved in that as well. Is that a solution that could be built on top of a macro tower? Or do you think that that's going to require new special antennas or deployments to support that? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: On the international elaters, there were about 8.5% for the prior year. We actually are seeing just as a little color on that. Obviously most of it's driven by Brazil. We have our escalators in Central America that are fixed escalators. So those typically averaged somewhere around 3%, those stays steady. And Brazil is where we're seeing the big decline and that's because obviously the CPR rate there has dropped dramatically, but we do have a floor on many of our leases with Oi that limits the drop to 6.5%. So it's really just a function of timing but somewhere around 8.5-ish percent was the previous number dropping down to about 6.5% for all of international. On the portfolio growth, Colby, we absolutely intend to continue our goal of 5% to 10% portfolio growth. We did not get in 2016 not for lack of opportunity, but for a lack of price, basically. We thought that what was out there was just not the right investment for us given particularly our ability to buy our stock back at what we saw is very undervalued prices. But it's the goal again and we think there will be again enough opportunities out there to certainly fill that on the number side and it will remain to be seen where we see relative price attractiveness. What are we including in guidance Brendan on the tower builds?
Brendan Cavanagh: We have about 450, most of those are international.
Jeff Stoops: And on your fixed wireless question, Colby, we absolutely can make use of towers provided they're in the right locations.
Colby Synesael: Being any of that, I mean, I know it's just that you’re seeing demos or trials at this point, but have you had any conversations with anyone that would suggest that they are intending to use macro that lease in some situations?
Jeff Stoops: Some conversations, yeah.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes. So my question is on Brazil and international, what you seeing in that market in terms of the rand sharing. And then you may have alluded to it, but if you could just remind us what portion of your escalators are fixed versus CPI based internationally?
Jeff Stoops: You mean for the – for almost all of the non U.S. dollar denominated revenue was CPI based with some floors. In basically in South America, so we've got about 17% of our revenues come internationally roughly 5% are of those are in Central America and Canada, all of which have fixed escalators on the tenant leases. And then almost the rest of it is almost entirely Brazil, which is – and Ecuador which is CPI based.
Brendan Cavanagh: In general, Jonathan you should look at the – you should assume that the non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues are CPI based and the U.S. dollars – I mean that's within 1% of being right on the money. So in Brazil, yes there is some branch sharing. Nextel is looking to do some ranch sharing with Telefonica. And TIM and Oi have done some ranch sharing although it does not appear to be pervasive at this point.
Jonathan Atkin: And then looking at some of the non-western hemisphere growth that you alluded to would you be more interested in purchasing a platform that gives you a regional presence or would a single country investment be more in line with your thinking?
Brendan Cavanagh: We continue to operate the company as a leverage capital appreciation story and we want to growth the assets. So the answer to your question is really it depends. And we would do either one of those if we saw that the right growth opportunities would follow the purchase just as we did when we first went into Brazil with the Vivo transaction.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you very much.
Operator: And we have a question from Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz: Thanks. Good evening. So if I just look at the incremental cash revenues that you're guiding for being added to the sites, it looks like there's about $10.5 million decline on the domestic side and about $7 million decline on the international business. I appreciate the color you gave earlier around the escalations in Brazil, but could you just kind of break that down for us with that new disclosure? Where is it really more on the incremental leasing side where you think you are making in some conservatism? I guess just across those two segments where between Kolos amendments and escalations. What’s driving the drinking the year-over-year decrease in new revenue added?
Jeff Stoops: Just for clarification because we’re really forecasting pretty flat growth from a lease up standpoint on the leases and the escalators in terms of the activity that we've seen recently. If you're comparing this to full year 2016 to full year 2016, it is down a little bit because of a little bit higher organic growth that we experienced in the middle of 2015 that carried over an impact of the year-over-year growth. So if you're going back that far, it would certainly be a slight step down in the organic lease up, but the rate of growth that we’re assuming in terms of leasing activity and therefore the dollars added are pretty flat with what we’ve seen here recently over the last six months or four months – I’m sorry four quarters last year. So that’s to be relatively flat. The escalators on the international side though are definitely down from where they were because the Brazil escalation rates, the CPI rates, were substantially higher than they are today. So that piece is down. But otherwise, I think, it should be relatively flat.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, so maybe I see amortization of pre-paid rent that’s impacting that kind of [indiscernible] compare?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes may be you are looking at the total numbers, certainly in that case if you look at the breakdowns that was what we were trying to show, I think, in the bridge as what the different components are that are contributing to our growth year-over-year. And you can see that there are certain items that are certain items that are stepping backwards, there’s non-cash item like straight-line revenue, but we’re also assuming a decrease in some of the other items, most of the other items that are stepping down are a reduction in the augmentation of the amortization – a reduction in the amortization of augmentation reimbursement is a big chunk of it. And then we’re also assuming a little bit less on some of those miscellaneous items that I discussed earlier like [indiscernible] and termination fees that kind of stuff.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, thanks. And then just one, quick one on capital allocation, if we just kind of look at your stock price today versus the opportunities you see out there in terms of M&A unbalanced would you say that you would prefer lean towards one or the other in terms of uses of capital at this point?
Brendan Cavanagh: I would say our goal would continue to be invested all in portfolio growth, but I suspect we will not and you will see additional stock repurchases this year.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go to Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson, please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hi thanks for taking my question. Jeff when you were answering the question about limited plans certainly you had noted that the, I hear those operational needs are limited and it’s really their financial hope that matters but you didn’t opine on the latter point. In your view are we anywhere close to the point where the venture halted a big four carriers is something we have to start thinking about when it comes to say about the growth outlook for the industry or is there still an adequate cushion there?
Jeff Stoops: No I think there’s an adequate cushion Nick, I think, you basically have lived through it these last two years. I mean we really don’t see under any likely circumstance reductions in levels of operational activity from where we were last year and then the last half of 2015. So I don’t, I mean, theoretically, yes somebody has to pay for all the operational needs in the network, but I don’t think we’re at a point where you really have to question whether that’s going to happen certainly to the degree that it’s been happening over the last six quarters. But we would like to see tax reform and net neutrality and whatever you can see that would bring, we’d like to ARPU go up for sure. I mean it does, I think, we have a good feeling where that money would go. we think it would go back into the network.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, all right, that’s helpful. May be one macro question, inflation to concern the investors at least were worrying about given the fixed nature of the escalators, if we did see inflation really start to pickup, how negotiable are your amendment in new site rates so they can add to the partial revenue adjustment response to that. And is there any other tool that you might to respond to inflation if it becomes an issue?
Jeff Stoops: Well our pricing structure is such that relatively every single lease and every single amendment that we do we have open and full pricing availability, so you would have that ability on any piece of new business to take into account inflation if you didn't think the escalator, need, ever if you thought it needed adjusting. Actually on that point and I think that's a good one which is why we think the escalators are appropriate where they are we may very well see a point in time where CPI, peoples [ph] perhaps slightly ahead of the escalator. So I think looking forward the escalators and not the fixed escalators in our industry look pretty reasonable. In terms of other things that we might do our expenses are pretty well fixed other than our SG&A and that’s such a low percentage of revenue that I don't think that's going to be a material issue. But it's really pretty much on the new leases and the new amendments where we would be able to address that.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: We’ll go to Walt Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walt Piecyk: Thanks. On Slide 4 of your presentation, that bridge that looks very nice. The $41 million, I think, that's probably slightly down from last year as far as the new leasing activity. Maybe it's flatter than but I think is [indiscernible] is down. Anyway American Tower just talking about that specific element of their growth being up 15% in 2017. So I'm just curious why they might be seeing that type of growth and you guys wouldn’t?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well I can't pick to what they've assumed our assumption is that things stay flat in terms of the leasing activity that we've had over the last year or so. That’s the driver of this number for us if we do have activity that goes beyond that and it starts to contribute to our financial results in time this year then this number will go up or if it doesn’t, if it stays flat, this will be, I think, about where it comes in.
Walt Piecyk: They were referencing, I mean they were specifically referencing like a change in the market in the past 30 days or so. I forgot the terms that they used, but they were pretty clear saying they all were seeing this new activity, they were talking about people with high band doing career aggregation. I don't know if they were referring to Sprint or whoever, but it's just are you just not seeing this because that they sound like it was pretty broad based as far as the activity level that they were saying.
Jeff Stoops: We thought when we said guidance Walt that we would just carry over existing activity levels and not produce anything above that until we actually booked it.
Walt Piecyk: Okay that's fair. And just one other question sorry to relate to American Tower, but they'd rather tough. Are you guys doing any testing on this 3.5? I think they're what they're referencing is there could be this new business model where the tower company becomes kind of like a wholesaler of traffic where you own the spectrum or at least use some of this 3.5 spectrum and at least second pass dedicate that spectrum whether it's in a building or small cells. Have you looked at the 3.5 or actually you thought about that as a way to maybe make money on this small cell enters that the carriers have?
Jeff Stoops: Yes we're evaluating it, we like the end building aspect better as we think it could be more exclusive. But we are taking a look.
Walt Piecyk: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll go to Phil Cusick with JP Morgan, please go ahead
Unidentified Analyst: Hi this Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up, you said 70% of the business was amendments is that what you're expecting for this year and could we see a pickup in call allocation and get to a more normal fifty- fifty mix later this year.
Brendan Cavanagh: Richard we're expecting that it would be fairly consistent with what we've seen over the past year, so predominantly from amendment.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I mean if you look at what's still out there to come, the AWS3, WC assets first now assuming that we see some of that to some of our revenue this year, it should sure that some of the operational activity. At this point we're seeing most of that in the four, believing most of that will come in the form of amendments.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.
Operator: We’ll go to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn: Hey thanks for taking the question. Looks like your domestic gross organic growth fell about 60 basis points sequentially. Just wondering if you could talk about what was – what were the drivers of that?
Brendan Cavanagh: Circumstance yes. So we obviously have had steady operational leasing levels throughout 2016, which basically means we’re signing up or contracting for consistent amount of recurring cash leasing revenue per tower each quarter. But the growth rate is down really because of timing between executing these agreements and when the revenue starts to hit our income statement, as well the fact that this growth rate changes that are over the truck trailing twelve months. So in this case the decline in the reported revenue growth rate from Q3 to Q4 was due to higher operational lease up in Q2 and Q3 of 2015 and what we had for instance in Q2 and Q3 of 2016. So basically you have higher lease up in the middle of fifteen at your financial statements in the fourth quarter and 2015, so the growth from Q3 to Q4 2015 was higher than the growth from Q3 to Q4 2016. And so as you kind of roll forward an extra quarter and you drop off, what was actually a bigger growth quarter that’s the impact.
Spencer Kurn: Got it, thanks. And one more if I may. As I think of all the fellow spectrum traction they are nice they need to get deployed over the next several years, it makes sense that carriers might want to strike match release agreements to make their deployments easier. The last time MLAs were signed was about five years ago. And can you just talk about your general approach to MLAs and actually look back in the last five years that you think shaped your perspective on that?
Jeff Stoops: Yes the MLA that we did not do at that time we looked back with the feeling that we definitely made the right decision because the amount of costumer activity that ultimately happened was well beyond what was contemplated in the proposed MLAs. But having said that, we're very open to MLA's provided that they come with the right financial terms and conditions and that we have a reasonably matching view of the future as our customers do.
Spencer Kurn: Thanks for taking the question.
Operator: And we have a question from Mike Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
Mike Rollins: Question since you at the balance sheet leverage that you're looking to sustain over your plan over the next few years, how did that play into your ability to continue to buy assets and if there are certain assets that came available would you consider propping that leverage up these further. And if you look at the other side of the equation, if there's further M&A in the category, how do you perceive that might position you as a possible seller over time? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well Mike we would take leverage up to a point where we could delever back within about a year, that's always how we've approached that. And I would also say while we haven't issued equity, I believe since one in 12 we did so then and I think it was to bring positive impact to our shareholders. So if we thought the deal was good enough, we would not be first to issuing equity. And on your second question we were on a public company for the benefit of our shareholders who create as much value for our shareholders as we can. We've done that for 20 years now or may be 18 years we think a great success as an independent company, we think we have a very good path to continue value creation in the $10 or more than broker share by 2020. But at the end of the day we have a fiduciary duty to maximize near-term and long-term value for our shareholders.
Mike Rollins: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. I'll turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Jeff Stoops: We appreciate your time this evening and we look forward to reporting our 2017 results as we move through the year. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA 2016 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. At this time, we'll turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2016 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in today's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results, and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, November 1, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G can be found in our Supplemental Financial Data package. In addition to the Regulation G information, this package also contains other current and historical financial data. This is located on our Investor Relations landing page at ir.sbasite.com. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan to comment on our third quarter results.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. The third quarter was another strong one for SBA. We were near the high end of our guidance for both site leasing revenue and AFFO and above the high end of our guidance range for tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Our solid performance was driven by both favorable moves in foreign currency and by operational outperformance on the leasing side of our business. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were approximately $1.7 million above the midpoint of guidance we provided last quarter. GAAP leasing revenues were negatively impacted in the quarter by a one-time negative adjustment to straight-line revenue of approximately $1.7 million. As a result, cash site leasing revenues were approximately $3.4 million above our outlook. Leasing activity during the quarter was as expected and in line with activity seen during the first half of the year. The primary contributors to the outperformance during the third quarter were a stronger Brazilian real than we had projected when providing guidance, which contributed approximately $2 million of incremental cash leasing revenue, as well as some higher non-recurring miscellaneous revenue items, some of which were originally anticipated for the fourth quarter, and some of which were incremental to our total expectations. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter was 4% over the third quarter of 2015. On a gross basis, the same tower growth was 8%. The net same tower growth calculation was negatively impacted by 2.2% of iDen related churn and 1.8% of other churn. This will be the last quarter that the iDen related churn materially impacts our same tower growth numbers. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 7.6% on a gross basis and 3.1% on a net basis, excluding 2.5% of iDen related churn and 2% of other churn, a little over half of which was related to Metro, Leap, and Clearwire decommissioning. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, gross same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 11.1%, exclusive of 50 basis points of churn, most of which was from one narrowband customer in Canada. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 12%. As mentioned, leasing activity in the quarter remained steady and as expected. Approximately 70% of incremental domestic leasing revenue added came from amendments, and the big four carriers represented 92% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue added during the quarter. International leasing activity was up a little bit during the quarter over Q2 with solid contributions from all of our markets. During the third quarter, cash site leasing revenue denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars was 12.1% of total cash site leasing revenue, the substantial majority of which was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.3% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 7.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding pass-through revenues. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was approximately $3.8 million above the midpoint of guidance we provided last quarter. Better than expected foreign exchange rates benefited tower cash flow by approximately $1.3 million relative to guidance. The balance of the outperformance came primarily from the higher cash leasing revenue I mentioned earlier as well as some savings achieved by controlling the direct costs associated with our towers. The quality of our assets, our excellence in execution, and our lease agreements allows us to continue to have the strongest operating margins in the industry. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 81.7% in the quarter, and international tower cash flow margin was 68.6%. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was approximately $2.7 million above the midpoint of our provided guidance range. This beat was the result of the outperformance in tower cash flow, offset by slightly higher SG&A and a weaker services contribution than anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.1% in the quarter, compared to 69% in the year earlier period. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. AFFO in the third quarter was approximately $2.5 million above the midpoint of the guidance range we provided last quarter. The incremental adjusted EBITDA just discussed was the primary contributor to this beat, with higher cash taxes being offset by lower than expected nondiscretionary CapEx. AFFO per share increased 7% to $1.53. Excluding the impact of both iDen churn and the positive changes in foreign currency exchange rates, AFFO per share increased 9.8% over the year earlier period. When further adjusted to exclude the year-over-year declines of $4.3 million in services margin and $2.1 million in augmentation reimbursement amortization, AFFO per share increased 13.3% over the year earlier period. We continue to selectively deploy capital towards portfolio growth. In the third quarter, we acquired 157 communication sites for $30.9 million in cash. We also built 93 sites during the third quarter. These additional sites are located in both domestic and international markets. We continue to invest in the land under our sites, as this is both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.5 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 73% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. Looking forward, our earnings press release includes our outlook for the fourth quarter and the resulting updated outlook for full year 2016. We've increased our full year 2016 site leasing revenue guidance, primarily to reflect improved assumptions around foreign currency translation. Our core expectation for fourth quarter organic leasing growth assumes steady amounts of incremental revenue added for the balance of the year, indicative of the stable leasing environment we've been in all year, and now includes approximately an additional $1 million of Metro, Leap, and Clearwire consolidation churn. With regard to future consolidation churn, we are currently producing approximately $50 million of annual recurring run rate revenue or approximately 3% of current total leasing revenue from leases with Metro, Leap, and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next three years. Based on termination requests received year-to-date, we anticipate the impact of consolidation churn from these customers to be greater in 2017 than we've experienced in 2016. Regardless of the timing, this consolidation churn has been expected and is not anticipated to impact our long-term goal of producing $10 or more of AFFO per share in 2020. In addition to positive FX related changes, our full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and AFFO have been updated to reflect our expectation that the level of services activity in the fourth quarter remains depressed and to incorporate higher SG&A costs in the fourth quarter related to our previously announced REIT conversion and the associated S-4 filing as well as advisory costs related to the Oi bankruptcy. Incremental reconversion related costs are expected to be $2 million to $3 million in the fourth quarter. AFFO has also been adjusted to incorporate the interest savings achieved through our successful third quarter refinancings and lower expected nondiscretionary CapEx for the year. We expect the fourth quarter to be another positive one and to continue to show steady growth in AFFO per share. With that, I will turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy - SBA Communications Corp.: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of net debt, and our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.4 times, back within our targeted range of 7 times to 7.5 times. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a healthy 3.5 times. During the quarter and subsequent to quarter end, we cumulatively spent $77.4 million to repurchase 0.7 million shares of common stock at an average price per share of $108.67. We currently have $472.6 million of authorization remaining under our stock repurchase program. Quarter end shares outstanding were 124.3 million. During the quarter on July 7, we issued $700 million of secured tower revenue securities out of our existing Tower Trust. These notes have a coupon of 2.877% and an anticipated repayment date of July 2021. A portion of the net proceeds of this offering were used to prepay the full $550 million outstanding of our 5.101% secured tower revenue securities. Also during the quarter on August 15, we issued $1.1 billion of 4.875% senior notes due 2024. The net proceeds of this issuance along with cash on hand and revolver borrowings were used to redeem in full both our 5.75% notes and our 5.625% notes and pay the associated call premiums. The 5.75% notes were redeemed during the quarter, and the 5.625% notes were redeemed subsequent to the quarter end on October 1. We ended the quarter with $150 million outstanding under our $1 billion revolver, and we have $100 million outstanding as of today. At quarter end, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.5%, and our weighted average maturity is approximately five years. We are very pleased our capital structure and believe it maximizes our ability to drive growth in AFFO per share. Our primary capital allocation focus continues to be portfolio growth that meets our investment return requirements, which will likely continue to be augmented with share repurchases at prices that we believe are below intrinsic value, consistent with what we have done over the past several quarters. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. As you heard from Brendan earlier, we had another solid quarter. Our site leasing business demonstrated continued steady demand in all of our markets, which our operational excellence was able to translate into continued strong margins and EBITDA growth. We allocated capital to a mix of stock repurchases and portfolio growth, reducing leverage slightly and back within our target range. AFFO is growing, and share count is shrinking. Through the combination of these factors, we were able to continue to grow AFFO per share, and our results and actions in the third quarter positively contribute to achieving our goal of over $10 per share of AFFO in 2020. In the U.S., customer activity has remained steady now for five straight quarters in terms of type of activity, contract volume, and revenue added. The type of work we are seeing continues to be primarily around the reforming of 2G and 3G spectrum to LTE as well as AWS-1 and 700-megahertz deployments. We still have not yet seen much in the way of AWS-3, WCS, or 2.5-gigahertz spectrum deployments, all of which remain opportunities ahead of us. By application and executed contract volume, the activity remains substantially amendments. Three of the four nationwide U.S. carriers were responsible for substantially all of our domestic activity. This steady level of activity underscores the current and future importance of macro sites at our customers' network plans. We expect the investments in macro sites by our U.S. customers will remain heavily weighted towards amendments for the remainder of this year and into 2017. Our backlogs remain solid, and our view of domestic leasing activity for the fourth quarter remains unchanged and materially the same as the first three quarters of the year. Our services results were at the low end of our expectations for the quarter, reflecting a very competitive environment for work that has existed all year and our choice to pass on profitable or less profitable business. Fourth quarter services results are expected to be similar. Internationally, leasing activity was up slightly in the quarter but generally in line with our expectations. Activity was more balanced between new amendments and new leases compared to the U.S. Brazil was once again one of our best markets in terms of same tower revenue growth. Oi has been current with all post-petition payments and continues to work towards a judicial reorganization. We are actively engaged in the process and expect more clarity on the final outcome in early 2017, and we continue to expect all of our Oi leases to be reaffirmed. We continue to grow our portfolio internationally. We crossed the 10,000 sites owned threshold in the third quarter in our international markets. We entered Chile, where we purchased approximately 100 towers with the right to purchase several hundred more. We like Chile a lot. It is a stable market, a leading Latin American economy, four nationwide wireless carrier customers, a growing demographic, and a need for improved wireless networks but with very disciplined siting regulations. We will look to both build and buy additional sites in Chile. We expect to be able to operate in Chile very efficiently by leveraging our very substantial existing Latin American resources. We intend to continue to grow internationally with continued primary focus on the Western Hemisphere but keeping an eye out for opportunities worldwide. We expect all future investments to provide a strong return on invested capital, further contributing to our current companywide ROIC of 10.1%, as detailed in our package of supplemental financial data. This return is well above our cost of capital and demonstrates we are creating value every day. A high-yield deal we priced in August was done at some of the most attractive terms we have seen in a number of years and had the effect of lowering our weighted average coupon and at the same time increasing our weighted average maturity. We have plenty of liquidity, and over the next 12 months, we expect our liquidity to remain over $1.5 billion, including the cash we generate. Hopefully, everyone saw our announcement of our board's decision to elect to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust starting with the 2016 calendar tax year. We have been operating as a REIT since some time last year, so we were ready for this, and, of course, it is something we've been contemplating for a long time. Our window for the election before we generated positive earnings and profits was either the 2016 or 2017 tax years. We decided to elect this year simply to get ahead of any changes that may arise from the results of the November elections. At this time, we are proposing no changes to our capital allocation strategy and intend to use our net operating loss carry forward positions for tax purposes to eliminate any distribution requirements, which we think will be the case at least through the end of 2020. Looking forward, we see many years of continued solid activity from our customers, which will generate additional revenue opportunities for SBA. In the U.S., the AWS-3, WCS, and 2.5-gigahertz spectrum deployments I mentioned earlier will come, and deployments will occur of the Dish spectrum, the FirstNet spectrum, and the 600-megahertz spectrum. More spectrum is anticipated to be made available in connection with 5G, which we also expect to provide opportunities for us. Even without new spectrum, 5G will require new equipment on the tower. All these items and I am confident others will keep macro sites a critically important part of our customers' networks. We see similar dynamics and prospects in our international markets. The deployment of the 700-megahertz spectrum in Brazil is an example of a large spectrum deployment yet to come. With our high-quality asset portfolio that we have spent close to 20 years carefully assembling, we are very well positioned to participate in this activity, which over time we expect to be very material. We are very optimistic about the future and take a long-term approach to the business. Speaking of our long-term approach, we continue to focus our attention and energies on our long-term goal of producing more than $10 per share of AFFO in 2020. We had a very steady third quarter and expect a stable and similar fourth quarter. We accomplished a number of things this quarter that directly and clearly help us achieve our goal of more than $10 per share of AFFO in 2020, and we look forward to reporting and measuring future results with that perspective in mind. Tony, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. We'll take our first question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please, go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Jeff, you've talked about some of the new spectrum deployments that could potentially take place. I was wondering what your thought process is around timing. It does sound like we've got some suggestions that some of that spectrum deployment is sooner rather than later, but that's something that we had heard in the past, so I would love to hear your thoughts around that. And then, one of the other major issues that's impacted the broader sector over the last couple of years has certainly been the focus of the carriers when it comes to the allocation of their capital, be it for purchasing new spectrum or some of it obviously involved in very large M&A. What are you hearing sort of from a carrier perspective here, and how should we frame that in terms of your growth opportunity over the next 12 months to 24 months? Thanks very much.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah, I think, Amir, and thanks for the question, on the spectrum, particularly the bands where multiple people want it, the AWS-3, I think you're going to see some differences in the timing of deployments. And I don't want to get too specific based on what our customers have told us, but I do believe, for example, AT&T has publicly said they're really not going to get cranked up around that until some time next year. Some of the others may be a bit sooner. And I think the same would hold true for the WCS spectrum, and we are seeing some increasing, although at least for us still not material, signs of 2.5-gigahertz activity. So a little more visibility, a little more clarity as we move through each quarter. And it definitely feels like 2017 should see some spectrum deployments that we did not see in 2016. And in terms of allocation of capital, these are big organizations, our customers that are public and have return on investment goals and a variety of calls on their capital. I think the one thing we know for sure is that over time, great wireless service, particularly when you're talking video, which a lot of investment has recently gone into the content side to pump over the wireless networks, you're going to need a lot of equipment for that. But by the same token, just as any organization I think would see it this way, money is not unlimited, and every budget cycle goes through the allocation of capital and the prioritization, and there's been a number of different things that our customers have spent their money on, and for those that are dividend payers, that certainly is extremely important, that they be able to continue to pay their dividends. So I don't think capital is unlimited in our industry. I think all that really means for us is an elongated and stretched out period of time for which investment will occur, because the one thing that doesn't change is the law of physics, and as you pump more and more traffic and more and more video through the mobile networks, you simply must have additional equipment.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much for the incremental color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, this is Richard (24:07) for Phil. On the churn commentary, could you give us a little more color on how we should think about it with normal churn, consolidated churn, and iDen churn kind of going away or ending? How should we think about it as we move to the end of the year and into next year?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. Sure, Richard (24:24). So, first of all, the iDen churn, which in this quarter represented on a domestic basis about 2.5% of a drag on our same tower growth rates. Most of that churn or really all of that churn took place in the fourth quarter of last year. So, as we now move into the fourth quarter of 2016 and our next reported year-over-year analysis, you will no longer have that. So, you'll see a pickup in the net growth numbers because the iDen churn will be behind us. As it relates to the non-iDen churn, we have seen that pick up a little bit recently. As indicated in our comments, we expect 2017 to be higher than 2016 on a full year-over-year basis. We've gotten some additional notices recently. This is primarily or it's entirely consolidation churn. So, you're talking Metro, Clearwire, and Leap Wireless related churn. It's not unexpected at all. I think when we provide our 2017 guidance with our fourth quarter results, we'll be able to give you our most current view at that time, but within the right context, I think the point is that we're – we've expected to see this churn happening in either case. The timing still remains to be seen a little bit, but it doesn't really have any impact on our long-term ability to hit our $10 of AFFO goal by 2020.
Unknown Speaker: Great. And in terms of in the international business, I guess entering Chile, should we expect more acquisitions in new countries in Latin America or around the world, or do you think is Brazil stabilized enough where you'd be interested in starting to do more acquisitions there again?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. I think for the right price, we definitely would continue to grow in Brazil. And in fact, some of the acquisitions that we completed in the third quarter and some that we have on our books to complete going forward are in Brazil. So, we are continuing to invest in Brazil, and it's really all a function of the price. We continue to believe that long term, Brazil will be a very, very good market. So, we're doing a little bit of both.
Unknown Speaker: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Good evening. Jeff, you talked about the 5G opportunity. I think there's been a lot of talk about using microwave spectrum with a small cell architecture. So, can you just be a little bit more specific about what you see as the opportunity? Is it more about using low-band spectrum as well, or do you think you can get involved with the microwave stuff? And then, just a quick follow-up. The REIT costs in Q4, is that really a one-time, or will there be ongoing additionally REIT costs in 2017? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. Brendan will hit the second one, but on the 5G, Simon, we've been spending a lot of time with folks who are spending all their time figuring out what this will look like. I think when it finally gets here in our markets, it will be a combination of low band and all the way up to the high band frequencies. So, I do think we're going to see at a minimum a lot of equipment changes to support the 5G. And in fact, my understanding is that even because of the oscillation and the cycles of the frequencies, even reusing the same spectrum to produce 5G is going to require all new equipment. So, I do think there's going to be a lot of touches to the towers, and I do think we're going to have a chance to benefit from that.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: And, Simon, on the REIT costs, those incremental costs in the fourth quarter that are in SG&A are one time. The vast majority of that is related to the filing fee associated with the S-4, which is based on market cap in addition to some legal costs and other advisory costs associated with going through the conversion process that we announced earlier this month.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please, go ahead.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, Ric.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Couple of quick ones. First, just to make sure on the churn thoughts, next year churn versus 2016, that is on the kind of core churn, right, not including that iDen drops off? So, it's kind of like your non-iDen churn would be up year-over-year. Is that what you were saying?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: That's correct. That's correct.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, Jeff, you talked about refarming 2G activities have been going on. What exactly happens when they refarm 2G spectrum? Do you expect there to be more work as 2G networks get turned off, or will there be a pause as they get that spectrum freed up to use for non-2G services?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I don't think there'll be a pause just because traffic continues to grow, not all the new spectrum is yet being deployed. I think it's more efficient for them to refarm. And what we're typically seeing is swap outs of equipment where you kind of get like-for-like numbers of antennas. You may lose some base stations on the ground. You may pick up some radio heads at the top of the tower, which is typically the architecture that everyone is using for LTE today. But we're pretty busy, Ric, with all the amendment work. It's actually there's a lot of very high percentage of our sites are being touched.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And the final question is the stock buyback pace was a little bit lighter than 2Q and what we were expecting. Talk to us a little bit about the pacing of the buyback, and you mentioned a couple of times that you're back into your target range of 7 to 7.5. Should we assume that you don't want to go above the 7.5 anymore?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: No. I don't think you should assume that. I don't think you should expect us to get up to something with an 8 handle on it. But I think given what we did in the prior couple of quarters where maybe we took advantage of some opportunities and bounced around a 7.6 or a 7.7, then delever back and kind of stay around there. I mean, that wouldn't be out of question. In terms of the amount, it's very simple. We set price targets periodically, and we either hit the target or we don't. We're not yet, and I don't know if we ever will be, we're not just spending a certain amount of money. We are buying stock at the best prices we can.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Makes sense. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please, go ahead.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Good afternoon, guys. I know you've been pretty clear about not planning to pay a dividend until 2020, but I was wondering if you could just talk about your thoughts on the trajectory of a dividend going forward after that? So, some of your peers have opted to smooth out dividend growth, whereas others have gone straight to a full maximum AFFO payout. Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. Without getting into numbers, Spencer, I think our bias today, and we'll have four years to refine this, is for a measured and growing approach so that there's ample capital for all things, dividends, acquisition, portfolio growth, and maybe some continued stock repurchases, as well.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Got it. Thanks. And one more if I may. I think this looks to be the first year in ages where you might fall short of your 5% to 10% portfolio growth target. Could you just talk about the newbuild environment that you're seeing both domestically and internationally? And do you see any opportunities to increase international builds next year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. We do see opportunities. We think some of the shortfall in our initial newbuild projections for this year are just delays and not changes in ultimately what gets built. And I think we'll probably end up just a tad short of 5% this year, something with a 4 handle on it. And what it really comes down to on whether it's newbuilds, Spencer, or acquisitions, it's all about the terms that we can originate assets on versus looking at our own stock and focusing on maximizing out that return on invested capital. So, it's all a capital allocation decision. It's not about volume. There's a plenty of opportunities out there. It's all about thinking or trying to do our best to spend the money as wisely as we can.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Great. Thanks so much.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please, go ahead.
Nicholas Del Deo - MoffettNathanson: Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, regarding the churn outlook, when PCS, Leap, and Clearwire are gone, is it reasonable to think that your domestic churn will be towards the lower end of the 1% to 1.5% rate you've experienced historically? I'd imagine there isn't that much else in the basic until we move the needle unless Sprint and T-Mobile eventually get together.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. I mean, that's right, Nick. I mean the vast majority of our non-iDen churn has been consolidation related, so as we move through that, there's – we would expect it to be towards the low end and maybe even below our historical low end.
Nicholas Del Deo - MoffettNathanson: Okay. And maybe one longer term question. There's an increasing belief that cable is going to eventually get into the wireless industry with some sort of facilities based offering. And, obviously, the benefits for you guys would be pretty straightforward with the new customer, but on the flipside, there's also the risk that a new competitor could weigh on the financial health of the incumbents and their ability to invest, especially those that have a lot of debt and dividend commitments. How do you think the pros and cons of that would shake out?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, we have always said, Nick, since we got into this business, that the ultimate determinant of how well we do as a company is largely driven by the financial health of our customers because we know the operational needs will be never ending. So, I mean, obviously your question involves balancing. It's nice to have a new, well capitalized entrant, but if it tilts the spectrum too far into bad business results for our customers, that's – I don't think would be the desirable result for the tower industry. Just the mere fact that – and we're seeing this in – I mean, Brazil is a very good example, and I'm not suggesting that there'll ever be any transition in the U.S. to the way Brazil is today, but, I mean, everybody knows that we need a ton of new equipment and new network in Brazil, but the customers are just choosing to slow roll that out based on their financial conditions.
Nicholas Del Deo - MoffettNathanson: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please, go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Great. Thank you. Two questions. One is just going back to the churn on Leap, Clearwire, and PCS, what is the aggregate dollar amount of churn from those three that you're anticipating in 2016 compared to I guess the $50 million that you're expecting to kind of attrit in aggregate over the next three years? And I think you said that's 3% of revenues, would you expect that to kind of roll off in 2017, 2018, 2019 at a fairly linear pace and it's just that that's up relative to 2016? Just a little color on that. And then also, I think in your prepared remarks, you said you expect to maintain greater than $1.5 billion in liquidity through 2017. Can you just – when we think about buybacks, which I think you guys have stressed are a key component of the way in which you plan to get to that $10 in AFFO, how might that constrain the ultimate amount to which you could potentially be spending on buybacks in 2017? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. Let me take the last one first. I hope the remarks for that – we have $1.5 billion and not necessarily that we will maintain that. The driving kind of stake in the sand, Colby, that we look at is the leverage, and our access to capital is great. So, depending on where leverage is, that may allow us to move into that liquidity somewhat. We certainly don't need to maintain that kind of liquidity, given our access to capital. So, we will have that much, and we'll see where we are at the end of the year.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: I guess, just to follow up on that then, Jeff, I mean, I don't know if you've seen some of the sell-side models that are out there, but it does seem like there's a decent assumption for a meaningful ramp in buybacks in 2017 versus 2016, and I think part of that is based on that commentary around getting to $10 and how you guys anticipate getting there. I mean, do you think that this is more back-end loaded to an 2018, 2019, 2020 assumption, or would you assume that if buybacks are a big part of how you get there, that that should be ramping up pretty nicely starting as early as 2017?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. I mean, we don't ever really guide to buybacks, but we have talked about buybacks being a material part of getting to the $10 by 2020. So, I think over time, and I'm just not going to get into whether 2017 is going to be bigger than 2018 or not, it's going to be more.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Okay.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: And, Colby, on your first question about the churn, so in 2016, our non-iDen churn, or at least through the first – through September 30, our non-iDen churn represented, of our consolidated same tower growth, was about 1.8%. The Metro, Leap, Clearwire component of that is a little over half of that, so close to 1% of that is due to those guys. We expect that next year will be higher than this year, and that's based primarily on an increase in the number of notifications that we've gotten from those guys recently. So, that's pushing up our expectations. And we're not giving 2017 guidance yet, so we'll give you I think a clearer view on this when we do our next release, but I think it's fair to say that we'll see an uptick in that percentage as we move into the first part of next year.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Okay. Thank you.
Unknown Speaker: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please, go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good evening. You highlighted the uptick in the proportion of amendments relative to co-location in terms of new business activity, but I'm just curious whether that suggests an increase in the overall dollar volume of amendments this year or more of just a share shift from co-los? And I'd also like to hear what you're seeing in terms of the breadth of activity of those amendments across the big four, whether that's balanced out a little bit more as the year has progressed?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah, I don't think we said, Matt, that the shift, the mix has changed. It's been pretty steady all year long, mostly 2/3 to 70% amendments and the remainder co-los, and that's on a revenue basis. So, if you actually did it on a per contract basis, it'd be a lot more. It'd be like 85 to 90 amendments and the rest co-los, and there hasn't been a material change in the mix all year long. And we're seeing that activity from all of them. Well, as I mentioned earlier, most all of our activity all year long has come from in the U.S. three of the four nationwide carriers, and it's been remarkably steady and consistent for close to five quarters now.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up on the services segment, there seems to be a recurring theme of some softness in that area across your publicly traded peers. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing out there in the competitive environment. Is it coming from smaller private companies? And we've also heard a lot of talk about drone usage for site surveillance. I'm just wondering if that is at all cannibalizing the maintenance work out there on towers?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: I don't think it's the drones. I think it's really a function of if you go back to 2014 and you see all the work that was done, all those people are still around looking for work, and the amount of work that is being done today in services side compared to what it was in the peak periods of 2013 and 2014 is a fraction of that. So, it's a classic supply got built up to meet demand, and then demand dropped off, and the supply is still there.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Good to know that the drones haven't taken over yet. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Bowen with KeyBanc. Please, go ahead.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on a comment you made with regard to passing on some of the less profitable business and that you expected to see some more of that in the fourth quarter. And I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: That's on the service side. That has nothing to do with the ownership of towers. I mean, there are some folks out there that are doing business at prices that we based on our company and how we would calculate things are actually losing money. We don't want that business.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities: All right. Thanks for the clarification. And then I guess I've had a lot of questions from investors also with regards to obviously the big acquisition AT&T proposed last weekend. Can you give us some of your thoughts on how that may or may not have any impact on not only your business, but the tower sector? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Well, long-term, I think it's great because the comments and the strategy and the rationale behind the transaction are to provide content for mobile, mobile video, and you got to have a great network for that to pay off. We will – we'll see when they actually get into the transaction what it may do to their short-term spend, but if it has any impact at all on short-term spend, I would expect it to be very temporal because of, again, the long-term view is you're going to need to have – if you want to monetize and maximize that content, you're going to want the best network that you could possibly have.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities: Great. Sorry, one last one, I lied here. With regard to CCI today with FiberNet, there's definitely more than one player doing backhaul in Florida, not – or actually, sorry, there's not a lot of competition in Florida. So, I wanted to find out if that impacts you guys at all, whether you're a customer of them, or if there's any relationship there?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Doesn't impact us at all.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Please, go ahead.
David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys, thanks for fitting me in, two questions if I could. Just, Jeff, you maybe alluded to this, but on the 2.5-gigahertz deployment potential for 2017, obviously we've got a particular owner of that who is suggesting permitting processes are kind of coming to fruition and maybe guiding for the possibility of higher CapEx down the road. In your services business, are you seeing a materialization of that permitting process coming to fruition in some of your deployments that you're doing for the carriers? And then the second issue or question would be, the companies – the carriers themselves are kind of advertising how their networks are all quite similar now in terms of capability, imperceptibly different in a lot of ways. I know that the tower companies frequently have drive tests, and you guys are canvassing the territory looking for where weak spots might exist, and the opportunity to market to the carriers presents itself. I was wondering if you have any way to validate how the networks have evolved in terms of their capability on a national basis and if you still see very narrowing differences or still very wide gaps in places? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah, David. The answer to your first question is we've seen some but not much activity on the services side. And the second question is, yeah, we do have some visibility into that, and not sure that all of the networks on a nationwide basis are quite as similar in terms of capacity as what you stated, but we kind of have some views on that, which are actually more geographically regionalized than nationwide, but I'm not going to get into our views as to who's better where.
David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Maybe I could just follow up on that, Jeff. Just relative to history, do the gaps that you see today mirror in magnitude some of the gaps that have existed and have been the reasons why we've seen the investments being made we have over time, or are they much narrower, and maybe question marks about what incremental investment is required could be made?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: No, I think, whenever historically, whenever you see a coverage build and then a total technology upgrade like we saw 3G to 4G, those are going to be your peak points of activity. But what we are seeing and what our amendment activity in particular is bearing out is that capacity holds develop constantly. And as you continue to look to pump more and more through the networks and particularly as you're adding video, we see – you may not see a 2013, 2014 period again, David, but I think you're going to see years and years and years of steady demand for what we do.
David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RCB (sic) [RBC]. Please, go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. It's RBC. So, I was interested in the EBITDA guide down entirely reflects or solely reflects REIT conversion costs, is that correct?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: It primarily is reflecting that. There is also a slightly weaker contribution from services than what we had projected previously.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then, two questions. One, any kind of update on small cells? I know you've been kind of examining some of the opportunities and for outdoor DAS or outdoor small cells, do you view the opportunity differently if you were to get right away exclusivity versus Dot (49:46)? And then on the tower build guidance, I notice that that increased, and what are – in which geographies, and what were some of the factors behind the increase in the build guidance? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Yeah. On the small cell side, Jonathan, we have a couple, maybe a hand full of projects that we're currently working on that were generated through our managed site business in the back and where we have exclusive relationships. Those are primarily in building opportunities, which I think is where we will continue to focus. So, I don't think our views have changed around the small cell opportunity at all for over a year now. And I think, we're having a chance to continue to see more and more different aspects of it, and it really just confirms and reaffirms where we've been on that. Brendan, do you want to-?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: On the newbuilds, we did not guide to an increase, so, in fact, we actually expect it'll be a little bit lower than what we previously said. We're expecting we'll probably finish the year with about 400 newbuilds as opposed to I think we were somewhere around 450 last quarter when we mentioned the full year expectations.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Is that because demand has subsided or that independent SARD has taken a greater share of the pie?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - SBA Communications Corp.: No, it's, I mean, Jeff mentioned earlier, much of the reduction is due to timing. I mean, we still have an expectation that a number of these sites will be completed next year instead of this year, but there's also some competition around the sites, and we're just making what we think are wise capital allocation decisions to not participate in some of those opportunities due to either poor economic or other terms.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. At this time, there is no additional questions in the queue. Please continue.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - SBA Communications Corp.: Great, well, I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening, and we look forward to reporting our fourth quarter results. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentleman thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA 2016 Second Quarter Results Call. [Operator Instructions] And also as a reminder, this teleconference is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you. Good evening, everyone and thank you for joining us for SBA second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2016 and beyond. These forward-looking statements maybe affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in today’s press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we may make. Our statements are as of today July 28 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G can be found in our supplemental financial data package. In addition to the Regulation G information, this package also contains other current and historical financial data. This is located on our Investor Relations website landing page at sbasite.com. With that, I will turn it over to Brendan to comment on our second quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another solid quarter. We were above the high end of our guidance for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO driven by both favorable moves in foreign currency and by operational outperformance on the leasing side of our business. In discussing our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO results, guidance and related calculations, unless otherwise indicated, we are excluding the oil reserve discussed in detail in our press release as we believe it to be one-time in nature and not to be repeated in future periods. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $381.8 million, or a 3.1% increase over the second quarter of 2015. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total GAAP site leasing revenue increased 4.8% over the year earlier period. Total cash site leasing revenue was $373.1 million in the second quarter, an increase of 4.4% compared to the year earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total cash site leasing revenue increased 6.1%. On a gross basis, constant currency organic total cash site leasing revenue growth was 8% materially the same as the first quarter. On a net basis, including the negative impacts of approximately 2.2% from iDEN decommissioning and 1.7% from normal churn, organic growth was 4.1%, exactly the same as last quarter. As we have previously discussed, the loss of iDEN revenue during 2015 will negatively impact year-over-year reported growth rates during the first three quarters of 2016 and we will be free from the negative comparisons starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Domestic cash site leasing revenue was $312.8 million in the second quarter, an increase of 4.2% compared to the year-earlier period. On a gross basis, organic domestic cash site leasing revenue growth was 7.5%, exactly the same as the first quarter. On a net basis, including the negative impacts of approximately 2.6% from iDEN decommissioning and 1.7% from normal churn, organic growth was 3.2%. Approximately 65% of incremental domestic leasing revenue added came from amendments and the Big Four carriers represented 82% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue added during the quarter. Domestic tower cash flow for the second quarter was $255.4 million, an increase of 4.6% over the year earlier period. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 81.7%, an increase compared to 81.3% in year earlier period despite the negative impact of iDEN churn. International cash site leasing revenue was $60.3 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.7% compared to the year earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international cash site leasing revenue increased 16% driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, net organic international cash leasing revenue growth was 10.1%, inclusive of 1.1% of churn, most of which was from one narrowband customer in Canada. Gross organic growth in Brazil was 12.3%. During the second quarter, cash site leasing revenue denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars was 11.5% of total cash site leasing revenue. The substantial majority of which was from Brazil. Brazil represented 10.8% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 7.5% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding pass-through revenues. International tower cash flow for the second quarter was $40.9 million an increase of 2.7% compared to the prior year or an increase of 12% eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International tower cash flow margin was 67.9% compared to 69.9% in the year earlier period, reflecting increased pass-through revenue. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $278.1 million, an increase of 1.4%. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA growth was 2.7%. Eliminating both the impact of FX changes and the impact of iDEN churn, adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.1% in the second quarter compared to 69% in the year earlier period. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. AFFO increased to 0.8% to $185.8 million in the second quarter compared to $184.5 million in the year earlier period. Excluding the impact of both iDEN churn and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, AFFO increased 7.1%. AFFO per share increased 4.2% to $1.48. Excluding the impact of both iDEN churn and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, AFFO per share increased 10.5% over the year earlier period. We continued to selectively deploy capital towards portfolio growth. In the second quarter, we acquired 42 communication sites for $40.6 million in cash. We also built 90 sites during the second quarter. These additional sites are located in both domestic and international markets. We continue to invest in the land under our sites as this is both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $19.8 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 74% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. Looking forward, our second quarter earnings press release includes an updated outlook for full year 2016. The full year outlook excludes the impact of the Oi reserve. We have increased our full year leasing revenue guidance to reflect our second quarter outperformance and improved assumptions around foreign currency translations. Our core expectation for organic leasing growth continues to assume steady amounts of incremental revenue added in the U.S. through the end of the year. The midpoint of our guidance assumes gross U.S. and consolidated fourth quarter to fourth quarter cash leasing revenue growth rates of 7.2% and 8% respectively, which are unchanged from our prior guidance. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brandon. SBA ended the quarter with $8.6 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $159.6 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.6x. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.4x. Both of these metrics exclude the Oi reserve. During the quarter we spent $100 million to repurchase just over 1 million shares of common stock at an average price per share of $97.80. We currently have $550 million of authorization remaining under our stock repurchase program. Quarter end shares outstanding were $124.6 million, down from 128.2 million shares a year ago. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on July 7, we issued $700 million of secured tower revenue securities out of our existing tower trust. These notes have a coupon of 2.877% and an anticipated repayment date of July 2021. A portion of the net proceeds of this offering were used to prepay the four $550 million outstanding of our 5.101% secured tower revenue securities. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. We ended the quarter with $30 million outstanding under our $1 billion revolver and we have zero outstanding as of today. At quarter end, in pro forma, with the July 7 offering, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.7%. And our weighted average maturity is approximately 4.5 years. Our leverage target remains in the 7x to 7.5x range. Our primary capital allocation focus continues to be portfolio growth that meets our investment return requirements, which could be augmented with share repurchases at prices that we believe are below intrinsic value as we’ve done over the past several quarters. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. As you have heard from Brendan earlier, we had another solid quarter. The volume and type of organic activity recaptured was virtually identical to that we experienced in the first quarter. Our site leasing business demonstrated continued steady demand, which our operational excellence was able to translate a continued strong margins and EBITDA growth. We allocated capital to a mix of stock repurchases and portfolio growth, while keeping leverage steady. AFFO was growing and share count is shrinking. Through a combination of these factors, we were able to continue to grow AFFO per share and our results and actions in the second quarter positively contribute to achieving our goal of over $10 per share of AFFO in 2020. In the U.S., customer activity has remained steady for four straight quarters in terms of both contract volume and revenue added. The type of work we are seeing continues to be primarily around the re-farming of 2G and 3G spectrum to LTE as well as AWS-1 and 700 megawatts deployments. We still have not yet seen much in the way of AWS-3, WCS or 2.5 gigahertz spectrum deployments, all of which remain opportunities ahead of us. By application and executed contact volume, the activity remains substantially amendments. On a revenue basis, the mix was 65% amendments and 35% new leases. Three of the four nationwide U.S. carriers were responsible for substantially all of our domestic activity. This continued amount of activity underscores the current and future importance of macro sites and our customer’s network plans. We expect the investments in macro sites by our U.S. customers will remain heavily weighted towards amendments for the remainder of the year. Our backlogs remain steady compared to last quarter and our domestic leasing outlook for the second half of the year remains unchanged from last quarter. We continue to believe second half organic leasing activity will be materially similar to the first half. Our services results were at the low end of our expectations for the quarter, reflecting a very competitive environment for the work that is available and our choice to pass on unprofitable or less profitable business. Internationally, leasing activity was steady and in line with our expectations. Activity was more balanced between new amendments and new leases compared with the U.S. International organic activity outside of Brazil came in above plan, while Brazil’s results were at expectations. Given the macro challenges in Brazil, we are actually very pleased with the results we are producing. On a positive note, second quarter reports from the Brazilian carriers paint a stable to improving picture for the second half of the year. We continue to grow our portfolio internationally and we had a nice increase in towers built internationally compared to the first quarter. With respect to the Oi reserve, we intend vigorously pursue those amounts in the reorganization process and we will see what happens. While not an insignificant amount, we believe the $16.5 million should be more than offset over time by the benefit to SBA of an Oi that has materially strengthened as a result of a restructured balance sheet. To that point, Oi has already recommenced new leasing activity with us post petition. Beyond the legal obligations to pay us rents to SBA during and subsequent to the reorganization process, Oi has strongly expressed its commitment and operational need to honor our agreements, reflecting the necessity to a successful reorganization of Oi’s continued access to the towers hosting its equipment. Operational excellence remains a guiding principle at SBA, one that prevails on entire organization with a heavy focus on cost control. Our reported second quarter tower cash flow margin was 79.4% compared to 79.5% in the year earlier period, which we are quite pleased with given the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, iDEN churn and a growing international inclusion of pass-through revenue. We continue to post low cash SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue and for the second consecutive quarter, posted adjusted EBITDA margins above 70%. Our tower cash flow and EBITDA margins are actually materially higher, excluding pass-through revenue, which is a better picture of true economic margins and we have got that set forth in our supplemental package. Beyond organic growth and execution in our business, we continue to focus on driving incremental AFFO per share and therefore we believe incremental shareholder value through the deployment of capital and the optimization of our balance sheet. As has been the case for some time, our primary uses for capital are portfolio growth and stock repurchases. The decision around the aggregate amount of capital we deployed towards these two uses starts with our view around how we want to leverage the business. As Mark mentioned, our target leverage remains in the 7x to 7.5x range. While the bias is to grow the portfolio, we are very disciplined about meeting our return targets and the actual allocation mix will depend on the relative returns available between repurchases and portfolio additions. We stayed fully invested in the second quarter as we took advantage of excellent opportunities for stock repurchases. We invested approximately $183 million of discretionary capital, of which $100 million was for stock repurchases, $57 million for acquisitions and lesser amounts for new tower builds, land purchases and tower augmentations. One of the reasons for our views on balance sheet leverage is that we believe we are in a lower for longer interest rate environment and that we can access debt at historically low rates today. The securitization deal we have priced in July was done at some of the most attractive terms we have seen in a number of years and had the affect of lowering our weighted average coupon and at the same time increasing our weighted average maturity. We have plenty of liquidity and over the next 12 months, we expect all liquidity to remain over $1.5 billion, including the cash we generate. Looking forward, we see many years of continued activity from our customers, which will generate additional revenue opportunities for SBA. In the U.S., the AWS-3, WCS and 2.5 gigahertz spectrum deployments I mentioned earlier will come and deployments will occur of the DISH spectrum, the FirstNet Spectrum and soon to be auctioned 600 megahertz spectrum. More spectrum is anticipated to be made available in connection with 5G, which we also expect to provide opportunities for us. All these items and I m confident others will keep macro sites a critically important part of our customers networks. We see similar dynamics and prospects in our international markets. The deployment of the 700 megahertz spectrum in Brazil is an example of a large spectrum deployment yet to come. With our high quality asset portfolio that we have spent close to 20 years carefully assembling, we are very well positioned to participate in this activity, which overtime we expect to be very material. We are very optimistic about the future and we take a long-term approach to the business. Speaking of our long-term approach, I want to spend a moment reviewing the assumptions around and our confidence in our long-term goal of producing more than $10 per share of AFFO in 2020. The goal assumes organic leasing revenue added per tower at materially the same rate we are experiencing today, which we have previously discussed is at or around historical lows. Portfolio growth is assumed at 5% per year. The goal does assume little to no foreign currency translation losses. Refinancings are projected using the forward interest curve and we assume we end the period 2020 at or below the low end of our current leverage target of 7.0x. Our assumptions do not contemplate any dividends through 2020 even if we elect REIT status earlier, because our tax loss position is expected to shield us from any dividend obligations through 2020. Our assumptions do include a healthy amount of stock repurchases, which could be reduced and offset with additional portfolio growth. We see the assumptions underlying our long-term goal as very achievable. We are confident that achieving the goal will create material additional value for our shareholders as we will be compounding AFFO per share by a mid-teens percentage per year. We have very steady second quarter and expect the stable second half of the year. We accomplished a number of things this quarter that directly and clearly help us to achieve our goal of more than $10 per share of AFFO in 2020 and we look forward to reporting and measuring future results with that perspective in mind. Tony, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] First in queue is Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Phil Cusick: First, I think Brazil, can you walk through a little bit more, you said expect second half to be similar to first half, but I think you said stable to improving. Can you clarify that for me, Jeff?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, our view is stable. The carrier commentary was stable to improving.
Phil Cusick: Okay. And then in terms of the buyback, that was up nicely this quarter-to-quarter. Should we expect this level going forward or with the rally in the stock, should we expect more like 1Q or even lower?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I think the best I can tell you, Phil, is that you should expect that we will stay at or slightly above the high end of our target leverage range and that investable capital will either go into acquisitions or stock repurchases, but we are only going to buy acquisitions that meet our return requirements and we are only going to buy stock when we believe it’s below intrinsic value. Now, we believe our stock is below intrinsic value at today’s prices, but we have a history of being opportunistic around where we buy the stock and I expect we will continue to do that.
Phil Cusick: Yes, if I can just follow-up, how do you see the M&A environment right now?
Jeff Stoops: There is actually fair amount of stuff out there, but prices continued to be high. And when you do the relative weighting against stock repurchases particularly at the prices we were able to buy in the earlier quarter, the decision tree was a pretty easy one that went towards the stock repurchases. So, it continues to be a relative equation and you should not think we went for stock repurchases, because there weren’t acquisition opportunities, it was because the stock repurchase opportunities were better.
Phil Cusick: Thanks. That helps.
Operator: Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could. One following up on the last question, I think this was the first quarter in some time total portfolio growth actually dipped below 5%. So, I am just wondering, is it still fair to assume you are targeting 5% portfolio growth for the year? And is it fair to assume you would reallocate capital to more buybacks, if there is still a lack of maybe more attractive portfolio growth opportunities? And then secondly, in the U.S. you talked about 65% amendment activity in terms of incremental revenue. Maybe if you could touch on how that compares to what you have seen in recent quarters and whether the current outlook implies this stays constant over the course of the year? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I will take the second one first, because it’s easy. The relative splits between amendments and leases, has been consistent at least two quarters, maybe two or three. And I think Matt based on our backlogs today that it should be relatively similar as we move through the year. And in terms of allocation, we have built the company growing the portfolio. We like to grow the portfolio when the opportunities make sense from a return on investment perspective. Our 5% number that we use each year is one that is well supported by the cash we generate and the leverage we expect to operate at. So, we are going to continue to look for opportunities to grow the portfolio. And if it’s the jump ball between portfolio growth and stock repurchases, we will favor portfolio growth, but we will likely not leave any investment capacity unutilized for this year. So, if we don’t spend it on acquisitions, we will spend it on stock repurchases.
Matt Niknam: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes. So, one thing I noticed on the CapEx guidance, in terms of new tower construction as that’s been hedging down the last couple of quarters. And I wonder what you kind of look to what’s driving that in terms of build opportunities, it seemed to be a little bit fewer this year than you thought 3 months ago and 6 months ago?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, hey, Jon, it’s Brendan. We basically have reduced the number of towers we expect to build this year with about half of that being related to Brazil. It’s been a little bit of a slow go with some of our customers down there based on the pace of progress with those customers. We are anticipating that in a number of those sites will actually slip into next year. The other half of the reduction is related to expectations around domestic new builds. In line with what Jeff was saying about M&A costs as the opportunities for these new builds have become extremely competitive, we simply made what we believe our appropriate capital allocation decisions and chosen not to participate in a number of the new build opportunities that are currently available. So, that’s really where the changes there.
Jeff Stoops: And I would just also add that compared to years past, the opportunity set for new builds this year is lower.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes. Can you elaborate on that? I didn’t quite follow to the last points.
Jeff Stoops: We believe there is less total new tower builds this year than in years past on average.
Jonathan Atkin: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski: Than you very much and good afternoon folks. Jeff, I was wondering if we could touch a bit upon some of the opportunities that you see with respect to some of the new spectrum goals. And there has been a lot of discussion among carriers about how they are going to try to optimize some of those new spectrum builds perhaps using different types of structures or I am talking a bit about how they are very much focused on escalator rates when it comes to some of the tower companies. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of with tower conversations you have right now and whether or not as that new spectrum comes to market in terms of being able to build out, whether you see the same size and scope of opportunities you have seen in the past?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I would start by saying, Amir that our customers are working hard as they should as we all do to maximize revenue and minimize cost and that’s really not anything new over the history of the relationship. The traditional way of rolling out new spectrum by far the most efficient way for our customers is to come back and amend existing installations where they have already the legacy power, the backhaul, the shelters, so that kind of sets a bit of starting point for the discussions. And there is a often – well, sometimes, I would not say often, but the way we have always approached leasing is on a one-off basis, where every single lease or every single amendment is subject to its own discussion. And when there are high rents on a site, because it’s either been very much loaded up or it’s been around for 10 years or 15 years and it’s escalated to 3% plus, we absolutely take that into consideration when we work out arrangements with our customers. So there will be many instances where we charge less for that particular site than we might otherwise with the existing rent in mind. And in many cases, certainly not near a majority, but not a substantial amount of amendments and I have mentioned this before, we actually work with our customers and let them do things for zero dollars on the amendment side. For exactly that reason, this is a partnership that we have. Their success is very important to us. And that’s how we approach it. And it’s worked pretty damn well for 20 years and we expect it to continue to work well. In terms of the actual spectrum that’s being still to go, almost every new bit of spectrum is going to require its own radio head, whether it’s WCS or 2.5 gigahertz or AWS-3 certainly 600 megahertz. There are some opportunities for the AWS-3 to be pumped on an antenna basis through the AWS-1 antennas. Depending on how those antennas were set up originally, our customers may or may not get the most efficient bang for their buck there. So we are actually seeing a variety of types of installations there. The 600 megahertz when it does come, clearly it’s going to require both new radios and new antennas. So we think the world will continue to be one that is focused on new and changing and in many cases additional equipment. And then when we worked that out with our customers, we kind of take everything into consideration and find something that works for both of us.
Amir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much. And one quick follow-up, if I may, I appreciate the color when it comes to your longer term guidance outlook, you mentioned no plans for a significant dividend payout, does that a way to interpret more expectations for REIT conversion, I just – because I know there was a lot of debate going on since the last earnings call in terms of timing…?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. Actually – I am glad you asked that question, because please do not interpret the no dividend comment through 2020, which basically is a statement of the assumptions that underlie the $10 per share or more of AFFO in 2020. That’s not connected with when we will convert to a rate. We fully expect to convert to REIT prior to that time. But what people should not assume is that by converting to a REIT, we will immediately and automatically begin to pay a dividend. We continue to believe, particularly with our stock trading where it is, that stock repurchases are a more capital efficient and better long-term creator of value than paying dividends when you don’t have to. And we won’t have to pay dividend, because even if we converted to a REIT say next year or early 2018, we would have NOLs that would carry us through and allow us to avoid the necessity of paying dividends through 2020. Does that make sense?
Amir Rozwadowski: Very helpful. Thanks so much. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question in queue will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. So Jeff sorry, I wasn’t totally clearly to me just there and so I just want to see if SBA became a REIT, it would be your intention to shield income with NOLs, not pay a dividend and devote those capital resources to the highest and best use between portfolio growth and share repurchase, I think that’s what I understood you to say, I just want to make sure I heard it right. And then the second was just on...?
Jeff Stoops: Before you even get to that, the answer to that is, yes.
David Barden: Okay, good. Thank you. And then the second comment was just on a little bit of your – I think Brendan’s comments on the build-to-suit market or the new tower development market being increasingly aggressive domestically and not an attractive deployment of capital opportunity for you, are you seeing – we are kind of seeing and expecting T-Mobile and AT&T and others to kind of invite this type of activity in an effort to either use it as a negotiating tool to achieve some of these options that you discussed earlier in terms of your carrier relationships, are you seeing a market up-tick in that activity level with more private equity money and cheaper money being available in the market impacting the business in any measurable way, that would be helpful? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: No. Not in any measurable way. I mean, maybe it cost us 50 new builds a year. I mean what’s happening is, as you have less new builds that are being built in general, you have a whole subculture of developers who have spent the last 5 years, 10 years building towers to sell to people like us. They are not getting as much work because there isn’t as much work to be done. So they are chasing that business. And that is really working to our customers benefit today. Good for them. It’s not particularly work that we feel like we should be chasing. Unlike those developers who really don’t have anything else to do, we have other uses for our capital including stock repurchases. So we do have alternate uses, which is I think an important thing to keep in mind. But other than that – other than our customers getting some towers built pretty damn cheaply and good for them, really doesn’t affect anything else.
David Barden: Okay, great. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question in queue will come from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.
Justin Ages: Hi, this is Justin on for Jonathan. I was just hoping you could talk briefly about how you guys come up with your FX assumptions just given the past two quarters we have kind of seen some FX headwinds from what is a conservative assumption set? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: We – consistent with the practice we adopted earlier this year, we have adjusted our forward assumptions around exchange rate to be in line with the median of updated projected forward rate that are published by economists at several large banks. It’s usually generally in line with forward curves, but sometimes not exactly. And so based on what they are putting out in their forecasts, we are basically going in line with that. And obviously the forecast rates imply weakening in the exchange rates during the rest of 2016, but the levels impact on our 2016 numbers is much lower than what we provided in our prior full year guidance. And substantially lower than what we have experienced over the last couple of years.
Justin Ages: Alright, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon guys.
Jeff Stoops: Hi Ric.
Ric Prentiss: Hi, couple of quick ones if I could. So obviously like Jonathan asked about the build program, we have seen you new trying to build a program at the midpoint of 60 towers last time, 70 more this time at the midpoint, what keeps changing, I think the build environment in the U.S. has been kind of what you described for quite a while, was it more on the international side and could we see further the cuts, I guess in the program?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. I mean most of it, Ric of the roughly say 130 or so sites, roughly 100 of that is Brazil and consistent with what I said before. We cut that last time based on Brazil and this time as well just a little bit slower go down there for I think somewhat obvious reasons around the economy in a way it’s affecting our customers. There are still are obligations under build-to-suit agreements that we have down there. And those will be fulfilled just the timing I think is shifting back a little bit. And the balance of it is domestically, we kind of came into the year with certain expectations, which were lower than what we did last year. But based on the competitive nature of what we have seen, we were making the decision there. We are probably going to build a few less sites this year than we thought at the beginning of the year, so that’s simple.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. But in the U.S. it’s not really, I mean it’s not a material change.
Ric Prentiss: Yes. That makes sense and it’s the right decision. So the 450 in your middle of the build program, how much would be international versus U.S. then in total?
Jeff Stoops: The vast majority of it, I would say in the 350 to high-300 range.
Ric Prentiss: Is international?
Jeff Stoops: International, yes.
Ric Prentiss: Great. One other I think easy one, we were pleased to see the first – the second quarter U.S. business being higher than we thought. Last quarter you had some one-timers maybe about $2 million worth of one-timers, were there any one-timers in the 2Q number or is it clean?
Brendan Cavanagh: Basically pretty clean. I mean, there are always little miscellaneous things, but nothing material.
Jeff Stoops: Not like the million of last quarter.
Ric Prentiss: Yes, okay. And final question Jeff, you mentioned that you are going to pursue vigorously the oil receivable, what is the process? I will admit I am not that familiar with how it goes – works down there in Brazil with this jurisdictional item?
Jeff Stoops: Well, that part of it is just like the U.S. You have all the claims that accrue as of the date of the petition. They are broken up into classes. And then ultimately, for those to be paid or converted into equity or however they are resolved, a plan needs to be approved by all the creditors in each class, voting by both amounts of claim and by number of creditor. So, there will be – there is bunch of us, obviously who have operating monies owed in the pre-petition period and we will be a class and we will all pursue it. But how much of that we ultimately get back will be a part of the bigger resolution, which is exactly I believe how it works in the United States Chapter 11 for amounts that are owed pre-petition.
Ric Prentiss: It sounds like it could take several quarters owe to play out?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, it could. And it will be nice whatever we get back when we get it. But at our abundance of caution we have taken everything we could think of and put it in the reserve, so that at least from a reserve perspective, we are done and any other new news will be on the side of recovery.
Ric Prentiss: Right, makes sense. Thanks, guys.
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Please go ahead.
Spencer Kurn: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how 5G will impact your business? Also AMT said they are in early stages of exploring options for new structures that are targeted for adding capacity in dense markets. That unlike outdoor small cells today could generate tower like returns. Is there something that you are right now where in an avenue of growth that you might be interested over the next couple of years? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. We are certainly watching and studying and working on all that. And if we can find something that we think is a good allocation of capital in that regard, we definitely will do it. I think 5G in terms of our portfolio, which again is primarily a non-urban residential highway or portfolio. I think you are going to see further equipment on the towers, but a continued reliance on macro sites. The high-frequency spectrum that people are talking about, really most people do not think that will work outside of a dense urban environment. Actually, there was some good commentary on that from Neville Ray on T-Mobile’s calls as to what he thought about 28-gigahertz spectrum outside of dense urban markets. And he had some pretty negative things to say about its feasibility. So, we are watching it all very carefully, but I think for – well, as long as there has been wireless, the laws of physics and how radiowaves promulgate kind of drives and dictates things. And you just aren’t going to get that outside of urban markets any kind of good promulgation with these high frequencies that folks are talking about. So, I think the true economically viable prospects there – you are not going to have 5G out along the highway corridors that runs only on 28-gigahertz, it will not be economically feasible. We think our towers will continue to be extremely important, more so as fiber hubs as allocation points for backhaul. So, we are actually pretty optimistic about where all that takes us and we definitely do not believe that systems and networks that run on 28-gig or even some of the higher stuff that they have talked about is going to replace or even dilute the macro networks that is the bulk of our portfolio.
Spencer Kurn: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery: Great, thanks a lot. Jeff, I wanted to come back to your assumption about 5% portfolio growth and you talked about the challenges of finding attractively valued assets. Perhaps you can just help us think about your international strategy right now. You have really concentrated Central America than Brazil. Are you still really focused in North America and do you think the portfolio growth will continue to skew international and we see number of portfolios coming up in Europe? Do you think you might go beyond the Americas or stay there? And any color there would be great. Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Yes. Our first preference, Simon, is to continue to flush out the markets that we are in and potentially expand into new countries in the Western Hemisphere. There is plenty of opportunities to do that and build towers and relatively easily hit 5% per year portfolio growth. So, that’s our first and foremost focus and I will continue to be there for a while. We will look and have looked on the other side of the ocean. Keeping in mind though that our plan as it exists today we are very confident we will produce mid-teens AFFO per share growth compounded. We would want to see assets that are at least that good. And historically, the European assets have been lower growth yield type assets that don’t necessarily or not even necessarily that don’t fit a higher capital appreciation type model.
Simon Flannery: So, it would be fair to say that of that 5% it would skew more international than domestic?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, probably, probably.
Simon Flannery: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman: Thanks. And just going back to the last call when you first started talking a little bit more specifically around potential timelines for converting to REIT, I think you would imply that ‘17 or ‘18 was kind of the range and it depends on where you were with the E&P dividend. And so my question is if you were going to convert say next year, when do you have to decide? In other words, you have to sort of make an affirmative decision and sort of operating differently by January 1 or can you wait until you file your tax return and look back and figure out whether you really think you met the qualifications or not? And then I don’t know if it came up last time, bur are you going to seek appeal already you feel it’s unnecessary considering all the other tower companies that operate as REITs? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Brett, we have actually been operating we believe in alignment with all of the requirements of being a REIT already. We just haven’t made the formal election as of yet. So, in terms of structuring our operations, having what would be taxable REIT subsidiaries properly cordoned off and making sure that we meet all asset tests and income tests that would be required as a REIT. We have been doing all of that now for the last 2 years actually in order to allow us the flexibility to choose to convert whenever we would like. And so it really is a matter of pretty much just making the election on the tax return. So, we could effectively do it even retroactively if we chose to so long as we haven’t yet filed our tax return. So, the flexibility remains. In terms of the PLR, we do not expect to look for PLR. We think it’s been well determined and there is plenty of precedent for tower companies as REITs.
Brett Feldman: Yes. And thanks. If you could just remind me, what was it about ‘17 and ‘18 and sort of the sensitivity around that? And do you have a bias as to whether it’s more likely one year versus the other based on how you are running those calculations?
Jeff Stoops: Well, it was – I mean, you have said it right upfront. It’s around the E&P calculation. We had – we basically – I think we disposed on the last call that our current estimates around our cumulated earnings and profits which are currently in the deficit position is that they would move into a positive position in the latter part of 2017.
Brett Feldman: Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk: Thanks. My first question is, had mentioned that a small cell cost about 20% of a macro, I am just curious if in your experience you couldn’t replicate the coverage or capacity in the same coverage diameter as a macro site with five cell sites, five small cells?
Jeff Stoops: Most people say no. It takes eight to ten. And I am not sure we necessarily would agree with the 20% mark.
Walter Piecyk: Okay. My second question is on, was on band 70, you earlier on the call I think you were talking about being able to put AWS-3 through to AWS-1 antennas, do you think that, that would extend to band 70, which as I recall I think the frequencies there on the uplink is about the 1,700 megahertz and then the downlink is right around 2000 megahertz or 2 gig?
Jeff Stoops: You got me there Walter. I don’t know the answer to that.
Walter Piecyk: Okay. But at least on AWS-3, you think they can pump the signals through the AWS-1 antennas, obviously you are having the radio head for each of them?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. But we have been told by the equipment manufacturers that if they do that, they are going to leave some performance on the ground so to speak.
Walter Piecyk: Interesting.
Jeff Stoops: It’s not – performance will not be optimized by running AWS-3 through AWS-1 antennas.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. And then my last question, I think I may have asked this before, so I just kind of want to refresh to the last three months or so, have you had any new discussions with people that are not wireless operators in the U.S. that are interested in looking at what your portfolio of assets are, where they are with the consideration of new lease ups?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. A fair number of Internet of Things players, machine to machine. I don’t know if we have had any of the big guys who I think you are talking about on the fiber side. But definitely there is everyday there is some interest from folks that are outside the traditional wireless world.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. Can I ask you one more and then – I think it goes back to – I forgot whose question it was, but on Brazil, you just – obviously it’s always been dead for a while, but when you think about the change more recently, is it more heavily weighted towards collateral or are you seeing a little softness across all of the three other national operators there?
Jeff Stoops: It’s I would say, it’s probably spread with Telefonica probably being the most steady and active. And any changes really is a result of the combined activity of the other three.
Walter Piecyk: Got it. Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: We are actually – and we are not projecting this, but it is logical to think that Oi who is being watched closely by Anatel through all this and now has a whole lot of better cash flow actually picks up. They certainly have the network needs for that. So it’s certainly possible. So we will be watching all that.
Walter Piecyk: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.
Michael Bowen: Okay. Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, but just one follow-up, I apologize if I missed it, but this question on CapEx quarter-over-quarter, I think your outlook went up around $40 million I was hoping you could give us any thoughts there. And then I appreciate the chart where you basically go through the – I guess about 10 different line items with year-over-year growth rates and then taking out Oi and FX impact and iDEN impact, looking at that quarter-over-quarter, second quarter over first quarter, obviously it continues to come down, literally almost across the board line item by line item, so I was just hoping you can give us some thought there as whether you think may we are reaching an inflection point here or just some thoughts on it, that would helpful? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: First, Mike on the second one. Some of that is driven by other things. So for instance, our AFFO per share growth year-over-year was 10.5%, which is lower than last quarter. But our services margins were very, very high last year. And if you just adjust it for that, one item alone and said it was flat from last year. The growth would have been 14%. So I think when you take out – there are other items of noise that perhaps could be adjusted out of there and we are very confident that there is not a steady drop. It’s just an accumulation over the trailing 12 months. And then the first question, discretionary CapEx, yes, we raised the discretionary CapEx by $35 million, I believe at the midpoint or maybe it was $40 million at the midpoint. Yes. That is primarily made up of new acquisitions that we put under contract. We did also have some decline in new tower build spending, but not a lot because a lot of the new tower build reductions that we are assuming are really just timing. And we are still incurring much of those costs. So, it’s mainly new acquisitions put under contract offset by a little bit of a decline in new builds.
Michael Bowen: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I will keep it to one given the time. Could you say that you are looking to acquire more assets in your Latin American markets? What all to shake loose any carrier-owned assets that remain? And do you see any movement there given some of the macroeconomic turbulence?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, you never, never say never, Nick, but right now with Claro’s forming Telesites, although none of their South American assets have gone into that yet. And Telefonica’s formation of Telxius, you are probably looking at all carriers other than those for the most likely opportunities. And I don’t want to get into rumors, but there are definitely some rumors, some of which we think are more real than others that there are some carriers down there that are looking to monetize their assets, but it’s really like it is everywhere else, where carriers – they need the money and they believe that the terms of the deal that they get any additional OpEx that they take on is outweighed by the capital that they take in and that’s really – that’s a different recipe for everybody. So, more will happen, do I think any of it is like next quarter? No. I don’t think that. But I do think over time there will be additional carrier portfolios available.
Nick Del Deo: Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Tony, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Actually the queue is clear. There is no additional questions.
Jeff Stoops: That’s great timing. We appreciate everyone joining us this evening and we look forward to reporting next quarter’s results. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening running through August 11 at midnight.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA First Quarter Results Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: Thank you, Ryan. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2016 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in today's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, May 2, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G as well as other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G can be found in our Supplemental Financial Data package. In addition to the Regulation G information, this package also contains other current and historical financial data. This is located on our Investor Relations landing page at ir.sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. As you saw from our press release, we had another great quarter. We were above the high end of our guidance for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $374.5 million or a 1.3% increase over the first quarter of 2015. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total GAAP site leasing revenue increased 5.2% over the year-earlier period. Total cash site leasing revenue was $365.6 million in the first quarter, an increase of 2.8% compared to the year earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total cash site leasing revenue increased 6.5%. Our first quarter cash leasing revenue included approximately $2 million of miscellaneous revenues not forecasted to repeat at the same level in future periods. On a gross basis, constant currency organic total cash site leasing revenue growth was 8.1%. On a net basis, including the negative impacts of approximately 2.4% from iDEN decommissioning and 1.6% from normal churn, organic growth was 4.1%. As we discussed last quarter, the loss of iDEN revenue during 2015 will negatively impact year-over-year growth rates during the first three quarters of 2016. Domestic cash site leasing revenue was $311.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 4.3% compared to the year-earlier period. On a gross basis, organic domestic cash site leasing revenue growth was 7.5%. On a net basis, including the negative impact of approximately 2.8% from iDEN decommissioning and 1.8% from normal churn, organic growth was 2.9%. Approximately 63% of incremental domestic leasing revenue added came from amendments and the big four carriers represented 75% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue added during the quarter. Domestic tower cash flow for the first quarter was $254.3 million, an increase of 4% over the year earlier period. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 81.7% compared to 81.9% in the year earlier period, negatively impacted by the iDEN churn. International cash site leasing revenue was $54.5 million in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 4.5% compared to the year-earlier period. However, eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international cash site leasing revenue increased 18.5% driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, net organic international cash leasing revenue growth was 12.1%, inclusive of 0.9% of churn, most of which was from one narrowband customer in Canada. Gross and net organic growth in Brazil was 13.5%. During the first quarter, cash site leasing revenue denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars was 10.3% of total cash site leasing revenue. Brazil represented 6.6% of cash site leasing revenue excluding pass-through revenues, and 9.6% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. International tower cash flow for the first quarter was $37 million, a decrease of 6.1% compared to the prior year or an increase of 14.8% eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International tower cash flow margin was 68% compared to 69.1% in the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $274.7 million, an increase of 1.3%. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.2%. Eliminating both the impact of FX changes and the impact of iDEN churn, adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.4%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.3% in the first quarter compared to 68.5% in the year-earlier period. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. AFFO decreased 1.2% to $182.4 million in the first quarter compared to $184.6 million in the year-earlier period. Excluding the impact of both iDEN churn and changes in foreign exchange rates, AFFO increased 8.1%. AFFO per share increased 2.8% to $1.45. Excluding the impact of both iDEN churn and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, AFFO per share increased 12.1% over the year earlier period. In addition to these items, also excluding the impact of the year-over-year decline in our services business, AFFO per share increased 14.2%. We are extremely encouraged by our growth in AFFO per share after normalizing for these temporal issues. Particularly considering the historically modest leasing environment we're currently in. This growth demonstrates the underlying strength of our core leasing businesses and its ability to generate mid-teens compounded growth in AFFO per share on a constant currency basis. This gives us great confidence in our ability to continue creating significant value for our shareholders for years to come. We continue to selectively deploy capital towards portfolio growth. In the first quarter, we acquired 117 communication sites for $75.3 million in cash. We also built 71 sites during the first quarter. These additional sites are located in both domestic and international markets. We continue to invest in the land under our sites as this is both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $14.7 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 74% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. Shifting gears, with regard to the company's tax status, we continue as of the date of our last federal income tax filing to file as a C Corporation. However, we have taken the necessary steps to ensure we are operating in accordance with all necessary requirements to allow the company to choose to convert the filing as a real estate investment trust at any time. We have not officially made that election as of today. Several factors including financial, strategic, valuation and tax considerations will impact the timing of our eventual decision to convert to a REIT. On the tax front, we currently have gross, Federal NOLs of approximately $1.2 billion. We have begun using some of these NOLs over the last year or so to offset taxable income. Our current projections suggest we will use up these NOLs entirely sometime during 2020. In addition, our current accumulated earnings and profits balance is a deficit. We anticipate having positive accumulated E&P sometime during 2017. We will continue to consider these factors and others in determining the appropriate time for SBA to officially convert to REIT status. Finally, our first quarter earnings press release includes an updated outlook for full-year 2016. The adjustments we've made to our full-year guidance, since it was originally provided, have been driven primarily by changes in foreign exchange rates and adjustments to our expectations for carrier leasing and services activity levels from the levels we assumed when initially setting 2016 guidance back in early November. Beginning with our 2017 full-year guidance, in order to provide the most accurate outlook possible and to be more in line from a timing perspective with our customers budgeting cycles, we will now be providing initial annual guidance for the first time each year when we report our fourth quarter results for the prior year. We believe having full year results for the prior year and better information at our carrier's customers annual spending plans will allow for greater precision when we provide our initial full-year guidance outlook. At this point I'll turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: Thank you, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $8.6 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $129.1 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.7 times. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.4 times. We ended the quarter with $20 million outstanding under our $1 billion revolver and we have zero outstanding as of today. At quarter end, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.9% and our weighted average maturity is approximately five years. During the quarter, we repurchased 507,000 shares of common stock for $50 million at an average price per share of $98.65. We currently have $650 million of authorization remaining under our stock repurchase program. Quarter end shares outstanding were 125.5 million. We have no debt maturities in 2016. Our next maturity is $550 million of securitization notes due April 2017. We believe the prevailing rates to refinance these notes in the securitization market today would allow us to further reduce our weighted average interest rates. We feel good about our balance sheet strategy, and our ability to refinance existing debt and access additional capital if desired. Our debt prices across our capital structure continue to reflect the stability in and attractiveness of our underlying business. Our leverage target remains in the 7 times to 7.5 times range. Our primary capital allocation focus is portfolio growth that meets our investment return requirements, which could be augmented with share repurchases at prices that we believe are below intrinsic value as we have done over the past several quarters. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. As you heard from Brendan earlier, we had a solid start to 2016. Our customers in the aggregate were and are still very active with their networks, particularly in the U.S. with amendments to existing macro site infrastructure. The driver for all this activity continues to be that the demand for mobile data is outstripping network capabilities even after all of the benefits of spectral efficiency and improvements to technology. We believe this dynamic continues for years to come and as a result we remain very optimistic about our future. In the U.S., customer activity has remained steady for three straight quarters in terms of both contract volume and revenue added. The type of work we are seeing continues to be primarily around AWS-1 and 700 megahertz deployments as well as re-farming of 2G and 3G spectrum to LTE. We are in the very early innings of AWS-3, WCS or 2.5 gigahertz spectrum deployments, all of which remain opportunities ahead of us. By application and executed contract volume, the activity is substantially amendments. The amount of activity around and investment in our customer's existing macro sites continues to be robust and underscores the importance of macro sites in our customer's network plans. We expect the investments in macro sites by our U.S. customers will remain heavily weighted towards amendments for the remainder of this year. Our backlogs remained steady compared to last quarter, but we have not yet seen any material increase in activity levels. We have increased our full-year leasing revenue guidance due to improved assumptions around foreign currency translation. Our full-year leasing revenue guidance now also reflects our first quarter outperformance, some pickup from acquisitions and assumes continued steady incremental revenue added in the U.S. through the end of the year at a fourth quarter to fourth quarter U.S. and consolidated cash leasing revenue growth rate of 7.2% and 8.0%, respectively, on a gross basis at the midpoint of guidance. Aside from the guidance changes due to foreign currency translation, these other adjustments had a de minimis impact on our full-year leasing revenue guidance of approximately 0.1%. With regard to our services guidance, we revised our 2016 outlook downward to primarily reflect reduced work from Sprint compared to the amount we recognized from Sprint in 2015. Services work from other customers is expected to remain steady for the remainder of 2016 consistent with the activity we saw from those customers in 2015. Internationally, we had a very good first quarter with constant currency gross same tower, cash revenue growth of approximately 13%. Leasing activity occurred across all of our markets and with a variety of carriers. Demand for our international towers remain solid. We built 61 new towers internationally in the first quarter. Activity across our five Central American markets was very good. Our largest international market, Brazil, also continues to perform very well on a constant currency basis. It was our best same tower gross organic growth market year-over-year at almost 14%. We continue to have operational success, building new sites for our customers and securing new leases and amendments on our existing portfolio. We expect solid long-term growth for our business in Brazil. Carrier networks in Brazil significantly lagged those here in the U.S. 4G deployments are in the early stages. The deployment of 700-megahertz is still largely to come in Brazil, and the demographics of the population heavily support expanding wireless consumption. We continue to execute very well across all of our markets, and the quality of our assets is evident. Tower cash flow margins were once again close to 80%, and well over 80% in the U.S. We expect tower cash flow margins to increase even further as we move into 2017. We expanded our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margins by 180 basis points to 70.3% in the first quarter versus last year. And our cash SG&A expenses remain very low as a percentage of cash revenue. This was the first time we, or for that matter anyone in our industry, posted adjusted EBITDA margins above 70%. Excluding pass-through revenues, our tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins would be even higher. We remain very focused on our margin performance as we view it as the best gauge of our operating performance. As Mark mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our 7.0 times to 7.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target based on our expectations around organic growth, interest rates staying lower for longer and our excellent access to the capital markets. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain in great shape. SBA remains a favorite issuer in several debt markets, and our debt trades very well in the secondary market. Over the next 12 months, we expect our liquidity to be steady and remain over $1.5 billion including the cash we generate. As always, capital allocation remains a primary area of focus. In the first quarter, we allocated capital in a very balanced fashion. We invested approximately $170 million, of which $75 million was for acquisitions, $50 million for stock repurchases and lesser amounts for new tower builds, land purchases and tower augmentations. Our first preference for capital allocation remains to invest in quality assets that meet our return hurdles both domestically and internationally as we believe quality asset growth at the right price is the best way to increase long-term shareholder value. The opportunity set remains good. There are number of additional acquisition opportunities, both domestic and international, that we are currently evaluating. As we have shown, however, if we do not believe those opportunities are at the right price or terms, we're quite comfortable using our leverage capacity to buy back our own stock when we believe the share price is below intrinsic value. We believe our continued thoughtful approach to capital allocation will create significant additional value for our shareholders for years to come. Looking forward, we see many years of continued activity from our customers which will generate additional revenue opportunities for SBA. The AWS-3, WCS and 2.5-gigahertz spectrum deployments, I mentioned earlier, will accelerate and deployments will occur of the DISH spectrum, the FirstNet spectrum and the soon-to-be-auctioned 600-megahertz spectrum. The FCC just announced that TV broadcasters have indicated willingness to sell the maximum amount of 600-megahertz spectrum targeted by the FCC, which we think will provide substantial activity for us in our primarily non-urban tower portfolio in years to come. More spectrum is anticipated to be made available in connection with 5G, which we also expect to provide opportunities for us. While much is unknown about 5G at this point, particularly in the non-urban markets, we expect a dramatic increase in the number of antenna, changes in antenna technology and size, the need for locations for C-RAN base stations, and backhaul and fronthaul aggregation points, and backup power resources. All these items that I'm confident others will keep macro sites a critically important part of our customers' networks. We see similar dynamics and prospects in our international markets. The deployment of the 700-megahertz spectrum in Brazil is an example of a large spectrum deployment yet to come. With our high-quality asset portfolio, we have spent close to 20 years carefully assembling, we are very well positioned to participate in this activity, which over time we expect to be very material. Near-term, in addition to the prospects for solid customer activity, in all our markets and particularly in the U.S. post the 600-megahertz auction spend, we expect a number of SBA-specific items will improve in 2017. We will have moved past reporting periods, which include the impact of the iDEN churn. We expect year-to-year variations in our amortization of augmentation reimbursements to have smoothed considerably. Based on current exchange rates, the headwinds experienced from foreign currency translations would be greatly reduced, and could, if current exchange rates are maintained, actually turn into a tailwind in the fourth quarter of this year. As Brendan mentioned earlier, when you adjust for some of these temporal items, you can see how strong our underlying results are and why we're so excited about the long-term value creation prospects for SBA. As a result, today we are introducing our goal of over $10 per share of AFFO in 2020 representing compounded growth of AFFO per share in the mid-teens on a constant currency basis. The future remains very bright. The business continues to be steady and predictable with ample opportunities to add revenue. We expect to continue to see good and steady leasing activity from our domestic and international customers driven by the growth in mobile data traffic worldwide. We're very well capitalized, and have many opportunities to create value through capital allocation. Wireless growth shows no signs of slowing, more infrastructure will be required and we are excited to be a key participant in that story. Ryan, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Okay. Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jonathan?
Operator: Mr. Atkin you might have your mute button on.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. Thanks very much. So, I was interested in the $10 per share in AFFO guidance by 2020. And what would be the right way to think about this split between international and domestic? And then turning to the full-year guidance, it looks like you increased it entirely on FX and also by sort of like a lesser amount than the amount you beat this quarter, and I wonder if that had to do with the fact you're building fewer new towers this year. You did rest, you got the tower build guidance, what are some of the factors there for the 2016 guide? Thanks.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. In terms of the splits between international and domestic, we're really projecting ongoing revenue growth rate similar to where we are today. We feel conservative view on the next four years. And in terms of asset growth, it's probably two-thirds international, one-third domestic. Although, the asset growth projections and all of that, Jonathan, are really right at the low end of our traditional 5% to 10% portfolio growth per year. So, we feel it's extremely achievable goal that we put forth.
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: Jonathan, on the full-year guidance changes, you're correct that most of the change was due to FX. So, if you take the leasing revenue guidance, we increased our midpoint of that guidance by $11.5 million from the previous version. $13 million positive increase was due to FX, as we discussed. So, the net change otherwise was a reduction of only $1.5 million at the midpoint. In the first quarter, we beat – when you exclude the FX component of our outperformance in the first quarter, we outperformed by $4.2 million. So that leaves us basically a reduction that's a little less than $6 million for the balance of the year from what we were assuming previously. And that's basically all due to the slower activity levels we expect organically during the rest of the year from what we were previously anticipating. There's a modest amount of pickup from some M&A that we did, but that's less than $2 million. So, basically the changes the reduction in domestic organic activity.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And the tower build expectation dropped by 60 [towers] (26:08). Just interested in where that's taking place, and what drove that.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. That's correct. Most of the reduction is due to anticipating in building less towers in Brazil. Many of the Brazil new builds that were expected to be completed toward the latter half of the year anyway. So, based on the progress or the pace of progress with our customers where we are right now, we're expecting that some of those sites will probably slip into next year, but because many of them were expected to be completed toward the end of the year, the impact on our forecasted revenues and TCF is relatively small.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks very much.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. So, first to follow up on the domestic. So, at this point, you're not looking for any sort of carrier ramp for the rest of the year. Is that fair?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think given the fact that we need to see something material between now and the end of the third quarter for it to impact our full-year financial results, Phil. And the fact that the 600-megahertz auction looks like it may be bigger now and last longer based on the reports that came out of the FCC on Friday. We're guiding to steady revenue growth between now and the end of the year.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I think that makes sense. And then, so for the fourth quarter domestic, you'd be at 8% year-over-year growth?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. On a consolidated basis, not U.S., consolidated.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I'm sorry. And what will that U.S. be?
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: 7.2% gross on a U.S.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: 7.2% a gross. Yeah.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's a midpoint of guidance.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Perfect. Okay. And then Brazil, I mean, you're saying things are slipping a little bit. I'm hearing that things in Brazil sound just almost completely dead. Do you feel like the growth there is sort of petering out further as we go through the year? What does that look like?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I think the comment that Brendan made was directed to new builds. Actually, the lease up activity has been fine and steady. So, we really are not projecting any material changes between now and the end of the year in terms of the organic picture in Brazil. Now, we would agree we think it could be a lot better if the economy were better down there, but we're actually doing just fine in spite of what is, as you said, a very tough economy.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: If I can, one more. Can you remind us what you lose by converting to a REIT? What do you lose in terms of flexibility? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, in our case, there's not a lot of lost flexibility because we already are operating as though we are a REIT today. So, from an operation standpoint and some of the administrative headaches that go with it, we're actually already set up now to deal with those. It's really more just about using those NOLs while we have the flexibility to do it. It's about some state tax implications that we might incur if we were to convert because we'd have taxable REIT subsidiaries that today are consolidated within our entire reporting structure. So, there would be some, while very small some negative tax implications if we were to convert earlier.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Good evening, and thank you for taking the questions. A couple if I may. The first is, just taking a look at the iDEN churn and the implications here, and obviously it's a very big headwind. If I understood correctly though, coming into this year, the iDEN churn we were experiencing at the end of last year was related to the TowerCo set of assets that you had required. And, I guess, I was under the impression that there were more single tenant sticks in that portfolio such that you'd be able to ramp down some of the costs, some of the site leasing revenue went away. I was wondering if we could get a perspective of whether that's actually happening or if there were some other reason why you've maintained those sites. Again, just looking at sort of the impact on AFFO guidance. And then I'll circle back with the second question if I may.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Jonathan, we actually did go into it, the TowerCo deal, with the understanding that there were sites that if we were not able to add second tenets, we would decommission those sites and eliminate the costs associated with them. We actually have been able to do that over the last couple of years, many of them in advance of the termination date that took place in October. So, we did realize a number of savings there. There are some others that were still doing that on, but that's been in, kind of, building in our numbers over the last couple of years.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Okay. That's actually very helpful. It's great to hear that you're continuing to find some opportunities in the private markets, I guess, both domestically and abroad. And I was just wondering if you might give us a little insight into what's going on from a pricing perspective for those assets, or are you seeing any change in terms of the expectations set of the private tower companies given that right now we're at a slightly slower secular growth than we've seen maybe in some prior years? Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The expectations are slowly changing, Jonathan, because we're walking away from probably more deals in the U.S. than we do. There is a fair amount though of product out there that it's available, and we'll continue to pursue it and only pursue it to the end when we see prices that make sense for us over both the short-term and long-term period of time. I think there is a little bit still of unrealistic views of reality from some of the sellers, particularly those that have the single tenant towers because while the carrier activity is pretty darn good around amendments, it's slower on brand new cell-siting as I think everybody knows. And that, some folks who are building these towers still are unwilling to accept that, but those are not the ones we're buying.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: That makes sense. If I could sneak one more in here, you gave the gross growth for the U.S. and consolidated. I guess, you just reviewed that with Phil. I was wondering if you – because you may have just moved past it too quickly from me, if you have the net numbers to correspond to the 7.2% and the 8.0%?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, sure. So, for the 8.0%, we would be basically around 6.5%, mid-6%s, and for the domestic, we would expect to be in the mid-5%s, around 5.5%.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Thanks so much for taking the questions.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, the first one would be maybe, Brendan, could you walk through your expectations on how the Brazilian exposure will exist through a potential Oi debt restructuring and all the different kinds of options that Oi has to, kind of, cycle through to address their debt situation? Definitely getting questions on just kind of what the risk is to that process because I don't think a lot of people are familiar with the 'bankruptcy process' in Brazil. And then the second question is, I think, Brendan, again, I think you used the words, historically low activity levels here in the U.S. I was wondering could you comment on any potential that maybe the Verizon towers over American tower have been taking market share from the market in general because it's the first time they've been available, and obviously there's kind of a new car smell that goes with that and then that goes away in 2017, and the market dynamic for towers normalizes a little or is that not an issue? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: David, at the risk of disappointing you, this is Jeff. I'm going to answer the Brazil question, because I was spending a lot of time with our Brazilian team on it. Right now, Oi is pursuing an out-of-court restructuring, which would leave our involvement in our contracts unchanged. We have not been asked to opine, we've not been asked to participate in this process. And if it is successful, there's no changes for us other than we have a financially stronger customer down there. So, we are rooting for that to occur. If it doesn't occur, Brazil has two types of bankruptcy, judicially. The first thing I talked about was an out of judicial process. The two types of bankruptcy in Brazil judicial are essentially very much the same as the U.S. Chapter 7 and the U.S. Chapter 11. If Brazil or if Oi pursues a judicial remedy, we're very confident that it would only be in the restructuring side of things, which, again, based on the laws down there, they would not be able to terminate our operating leases. So we feel extremely good about how we're going to come out of this Oi debt restructuring process, whether it's out-of-court or in-court. And then I would add that just like in the United States, if, in fact, the judicial process turns into a Chapter 7 liquidation, that would be the scenario in which we could lose our leases. We don't expect to see that even in the slightest.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And, David, on your other question, I think the words I used were historically modest, not necessarily historically low. But in either case, I think everybody knows that leasing activity has been depressed in terms of historical levels over the last year-and-a-half. So, we're seeing that because the carriers are focused primarily on upgrades at existing sites and capacity builds, not a lot of new sighting. So, I think, we don't believe that there's any impact from the Verizon towers taking market share. We haven't seen any evidence of that at all. So, I don't think that's a cause of this. And I think if you look across the industry, you wouldn't see any disparity in terms of what each of the tower companies are experiencing.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Perfect. And good answer, Jeff. Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you, very much. Just wanted to follow-up on some of the prior questions around the U.S. activity levels. I guess, what I'm trying to assess is, what has changed with respect to your overall views right now versus last quarter. Is it that you haven't seen the pickup in activity you had anticipated? And so, given where we are in the year, it's just prudent to make those adjustments, or do you think we're at a sort of shift in terms of demand levels where we're probably not going to see as much leasing activity when it comes to new co-location activity because of some of the capital allocations to different types of structures, small cells or anything along those lines to densify networks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Amir, I think it's entirely your first premise. I think we're just at the point now, and we were very clear with this on our last couple calls that our initial guidance assumed sequentially increasing activity levels. And we haven't seen that from end of fourth quarter now to end of first quarter, and because we effectively only have four months or five months to go, that can impact our full year results. At this point, we're just going to guide to steady activity. But in terms of all the stuff that still needs to be done, and we think will be done in some period of time, we remain very confident about that.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, if I may, on your longer term target on the $10 that you had mentioned, how should we think about that relative to growth versus capital allocation towards share buyback or anything along those lines?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think you should consider it as a mix. And our assumptions around that, and first of all, it's over $10 a share. Assume that we stay levered, it assumes some continued devaluation over time in the Brazilian reals. It assumes some capital allocation towards new builds, portfolio growth and augmentations and other things, but it does include a healthy slug of that capital allocation to share repurchases.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you very much for the incremental color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Just continuing on that last question on the $10, can you just describe your sort of confidence level at getting more than $10? Is this sort of a base case number or is this a conservative case number? And perhaps you just talk about what escalators you're assuming? Can you continue at the 3%, 3.5% rate in that? And then I think you mentioned that you're cutting your expectations on site development in part because Sprint is doing less. But what's changed between this quarter and last quarter around that specifically, because it sounds like some of that activity you weren't expecting any way coming into the year? Thanks.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'll take the last one first. We did have a number of conversations and things, which, through our last call, gave us confidence that maybe the reductions from that client would not be necessary, but that's no longer the case, Simon.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In terms of some of the other assumptions around the long-term, we are continuing to assume that U.S. escalators stay in the 3% to 3.5% range. We don't see any reason why that would change. And in Brazil, for example, we use a declining inflation rate over this period of time, down from where it is today. So, we actually think it's a fairly – you used the word base-case and if you were to see the document that we've prepared we call that our base case, but we do think the assumptions around it are very conservative.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. Jeff, maybe just a quick comment and I guess you can frame it in the 2020 over $10 guide. Just thinking about your view on long-term growth and whether that's changed over the last six months. And then maybe just a comment on the carrier behavior out there with respect to pricing, any sort of more aggressive push back from the carriers to you guys when you're signing new deals. Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think long-term growth – I mean, in the last two years, Mike, I think we've gone from a 20% compounded AFFO per share world down to a mid-teens world, and that's the world that we see going forward. And again that's with fairly non-heroic assumptions around it. I think when you parse down the operating leverage in our business all the way down to the AFFO per share line, and you look at our continued use of leverage at even assuming increasing rates, but not wildly increasing rates over that period of time, that's how you get there. So, the biggest change is, from two years ago to today are several percentage points of decline in assumed organic growth rates. So that's kind of our views have changed over the last couple of years. In terms of carrier behavior, hey, look, our customers are fighting for every dime. They're in a very competitive world out there. They're definitely, as they always have, paying attention to expenses. So, they fight for every last dollar, but we're good partners. They need what we have. We understand what their needs are, and we meet somewhere in the middle and we continue to do good business. But, yeah, our customers are focused on expenses, absolutely.
Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Great. That's helpful. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And just going back to your REIT conversion evaluation, I just want to make sure I get this correct. You're basically saying that if you were to pursue a conversion after next year, you would almost certainly have to pay at a purging dividend. Is that correct?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Our current forecast say that we will be E&P positive sometime during 2017. So that would be correct if that holds true.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So then, if you were to achieve your base case in excess of $10 a share of AFFO, and you think about what the E&P would accumulate to at that point in time that kind of lines up in terms of when you would have exhausted your NOLs. How big could that purging dividend be if you literally waited until you had no NOLs left to shield your taxes?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, Brett, I mean, you're talking somewhere north of $1 billion certainly. So, I mean, at this stage that's not high on our list of considerations to wait that long, but it would be pretty significant.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So then, I guess, my last question here on this, your largest peers, public peers have already converted to REITs. They ultimately decided to convert when they still had NOLs, and I think the E&P payment was a component of that. And so, they also decided that on conversion to REIT status, they would initiate dividends even though theoretically they could have postponed it for a bit. Do you have a view that if you decided to pursue that conversion while you still had NOLs that you would ultimately choose to start paying some level of dividend to align with other re-practices or is that still to be determined?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. That's the part it's still to be determined. In our earlier comments, Brett, assume that we would convert somewhere around the time that we did have positive E&P, so that you don't have an additional drain on the capital structure, but that over $10 per share in 2020 does not assume at this point the commencement of a dividend between now and then. So, that's something yet to be looked at.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you for that color.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Whitney Fletcher - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, this is actually Whitney on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. Just one question on leverage. So, it looks like you guys stayed flat at around 7.7 times this quarter above your target range. So, just wondering how we should think about leverage for the rest of the year, and when you plan on kind of getting towards that target goal. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We continue to target 7.0 times to 7.5 times. We're only above it because we believe our stock has represented extremely strong intrinsically valued opportunity. So, you should see us get back to our target range by the end of the year.
Whitney Fletcher - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Great. Just want to go back to the response you had to Brett's question. So, if I heard you correctly, you said that the greater than $10 per share in AFFO in 2020 assumes no dividend is paid between now and that period. So, it seems like the real decision to potentially transition to a REIT, which, I guess, you voluntarily started talk about today more proactively, would be just because you don't want to pay an E&P purge. So, effectively since you're assuming you're going to be positive in that regard in 2017. It doesn't seem like there's any reason for us not to assume that you won't transition to a REIT in 2017. Am I not understanding that correctly?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. You may be overstating it a little bit, because initially the E&P is going to be de minimis.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Okay.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's going to build, but it's not going to be much of anything in 2017.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Right. So, yeah, between 2017 and when it becomes material from your perspective is when you would want to convert. And then, I guess, as tied to that, when you do become a REIT would you still have the same leverage goals, I mean, the 7 times to 7.5 times? Is there any reason why as a REIT you would think that that would have to change?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. It wouldn't have to change other than our assessment of how best to maximize value for our shareholders. I mean, we have, for years, believed and particularly in this interest rate environment that our capital appreciation model of leverage growth was the way to go. The math continues to support that regardless of whether you're in a REIT tax selection or not, but we will. As we get closer, we'll be evaluating whether a lower leverage, higher payout yield model makes more sense for our shareholders than the leverage capital appreciation model. And that's the issue, that's the decision to be made.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Great. And then my last question, amendments, so I think we've all historically appreciated that in a generational upgrade cycle, 2G, 3G, 4G refers to (49:40) the amendments, and then at some point we're anticipating that we'll see a lot more self-splitting. And, so far, with 4G that really hasn't played out that way, it continues to be more amendments. And I think you've been asked this question a few times tonight, but I'll try to ask a little bit differently. It seems like something is different with this current generation upgrade versus those previous, and that's why we're not seeing the cells playing like perhaps we have in the past and you know one or more obvious explanations for that could be small cell, which is more than new cell sites are going towards small cells as opposed to macro towers and that would suggest them that the overall growth rates that we've seen with 2G and 3G historically may not apply then to what we're seeing with 4G, what we'll see on a go forward basis with 5G. What's your response to that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I don't see it that way. What I see over the last two years, 2015 and 2016 is a world where our customers have a lot of calls on their capital. I believe it was $45 billion of AWS through spending last year and now in light of the 126-megahertz of 600 spectrum could be that much this year. You had other things that some of our customers were doing. And at the end of the day, I believe their top priority in addition to growing their business is to maintaining their dividend. So, they're prioritizing things. And they've concluded, I think, that their highest priority for the time being is to densify their networks, which densify doesn't mean just small cells, it means amendments to all of the macro sites. And that's where the capital is going, which I find very logical in light of where they happen to be and the amounts of money that they have available to spend without impacting their credit ratings or their dividends. So, I would disagree with you there a little bit, Colby.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company: Okay. Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Del Deo - MoffettNathanson: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First on the $10 per share AFFO goal, is that still achievable in the event that T-Mobile and Sprint get together?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It is because we don't think, I mean, they're not going to be able to decommission things that quickly. So, yes. The answer to that would be, yes, but then we'd have to read that with – that is not anticipated in that plan. I don't think it would prevent us from getting there, but it might impact the growth rates going forward in the United States.
Nicholas Del Deo - MoffettNathanson: Okay. Makes sense. And then second question, last quarter you talked having some things in the hopper that could help bolster growth later this year, and they weren't in guidance because they hadn't been signed. So, presumably, they wouldn't have been a driver of the reduction in the outlook. Are those items still out there? And if so, what might the timing look like if they were to flow through?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Some of those have come in, Nick, but the backlogs just haven't come in above that. We needed backlogs to continue to grow, and they've actually been very, very steady, but some of those things that we thought could happen did, but the backlog still are stable and don't support that tick up in activity that we had originally assumed that's going to occur.
Nicholas Del Deo - MoffettNathanson: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. Just like to get an update, I guess, going back to your capital allocation plans. I think both in terms of portfolio M&A and the buyback, it seems as if the pace of tower M&A continues to decelerate, and looks like you chose not to do any additional buyback since the fourth quarter call. So, just curious how you're thinking about putting the capital to work right now, and what the implications might be for your debt ratios leverage going forward?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we have a lot of capital. We have an undrawn revolver and then we have our organic AFFO that we generate. So, we have tremendous liquidity. And, you're right. And to your point, the primary governor at this point is our target leverage range. So, as we move through that, and EBITDA picks up, and we could actually have a tremendous boost if we see continued improvements in the FX translation rates. But that will largely dictate how much of that liquidity we will spend. It's not a liquidity issue as much as it is just staying around our long time leverage targets.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, I guess, what I was looking for there was just sort of an update of how you're thinking about the M&A environment. You said that it continues to be kind of sticky in terms of pricing and not necessarily all that attractive. So, is there any consideration of going down below the target range for the time being when the environment kind of remains less attractive? I guess, how do you think shareholders would react to a de-levering process, kind of a natural organic de-levering process and maybe a move toward a slower growth income driven story for SBA?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think they would react well if you kind of take that through to its logical conclusion. But if you do that, you're really giving up the opportunity to use historically low cost debt to grow the company and particularly to buy your stock back at what I think will prove to be extremely attractive pricing, particularly as we move past 2016 and people start to see what the numbers look like once we get rid of the iDEN churn and the other three or four items that we mentioned, which all will look better in 2017. We think we have some pretty unique opportunities right now that will be maximized if we continue to maintain the capital structure that we have.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, perhaps I missed this before, but could you just remind us what your gross and net same tower growth assumptions are for both domestic and international on the updated 2016 guide?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It measured as a fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter of last year, the consolidated gross number was 8%, net, 6.5% range. On the domestic side, it was about 7.2% at the midpoint of guidance, mid 5%s, 5.5% on a net basis; and internationally, we would expect it to be about 13% both gross and net.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: Ryan, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Okay. And that question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thanks a lot. Digging deep here to find something value added here, but couple quick ones, since everybody has hit everything. On the 600-megahertz auction, I took from your comments that maybe you had something baked into your outlook. So, if I'm reading that right from your commentary, if you could address that. And then, one of the things I was looking at also was your percentage of domestic site leasing revenue. Most of the percentages over the last two years seem to make sense except for T-Mobile. It looks like they basically remained about constant in that 19%, 19.5% range of site leasing revenue. I would have thought that that would have increased given their activity. Can you kind of point me in the direction of what I'm missing there? Thanks.
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: Yeah. Brendan is going to take the second one, but I said something a little different on the 600-megahertz. My point on the 600-megahertz is, with the news that came out Friday and the size of the spectrum being offered now kind of at the max. That may prove to be a bigger call on our customers capital than what folks originally thought or what they even planned for without knowing that the maximum was going to be made available. And the way that auction works now with the greater amount of spectrum being available, it actually could take longer to complete as well. That was the point I was trying to make.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And then, Michael, on the question about T-Mobile, if you go back into the 2014 timeframe and earlier, they were just simply being outpaced by AT&T pretty significantly. So, their percentage wasn't necessarily increasing too much at that point. Recently it's begun to increase some, but the other factor is that we signed with them an agreement that allowed for a much higher escalator for a period of time. And when you book that on a GAAP basis and those percentages you're looking at are GAAP based, it straight lined in. So, you don't actually see the revenue contribution from that increasing over time, but you are seeing some increases if you look at the last so many quarters, you'll see that they're actually picking up. I think they're up a full percentage point from six months ago just based on organic new leasing activity.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thank you very much.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And thank you everyone for joining us this evening, and we look forward to reporting our second quarter results. Thanks, Ryan.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference. Want to thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. Welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for SBA's fourth quarter 2015's earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2016 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in today's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, February 25, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G can be found in our newly-created Supplemental Financial Data package. In addition to the Regulation G information, this package also contains other current and historical financial data. This document will be updated quarterly and is located on our IR landing page at ir.sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. As you saw from our press release, we had another very solid quarter. We were above the midpoint of our guidance for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Our consolidated gross organic site leasing revenue growth in the quarter was 8% on a constant currency basis. Excluding iDen churn, our AFFO per share growth was 14.4% versus the year-ago period on a constant currency basis. These results are consistent with our longer-term view of our ability to generate high single-digit organic leasing revenue growth and mid-teens AFFO per share growth on a constant currency basis. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $368.5 million or a 1.9% increase over the fourth quarter of 2014. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total GAAP site leasing revenue increased 7.5% over the year-earlier period. In addition, as forecasted, we experienced termination of a large number of iDen leases during the quarter. These terminations had a negative sequential impact on quarterly cash leasing revenue of $6.5 million versus the third quarter of 2015. Total 2015 iDen terminations had a negative year-over-year impact on the fourth quarter of $9.1 million. Eliminating the impacts of iDen churn and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total GAAP site leasing revenue increased 10% over the year-earlier period. We do not expect any incremental iDen churn going forward until the fourth quarter of 2018, although the 2015 iDen churn will continue to negatively impact comparative results this year. Since the negative impact to comparable results will end this year, we thought it would be useful to present pro forma results, excluding iDen churn, which we have in the press release as well as discussing them on today's call. We'll continue with that disclosure throughout this year. Domestic cash site leasing revenue was $305.1 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 3.3% compared to the year-earlier period. On a gross basis, organic domestic cash site leasing revenue growth was 7.5%. On a net basis, including the negative impacts of approximately 3.5% from iDen decommissioning and 1.5% from normal churn, organic growth was 2.5%. Domestic tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $249.1 million, an increase of 3% over the year-earlier period. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 81.6% compared to 81.8% in the year-earlier period, negatively impacted by iDen churn. Approximately 62% of domestic lease up revenue came from amendments and the big four carriers represented 86% total new domestic leasing activity. The ratio of the actual number of executed amendments to executed new lease agreements was greater than eight to one. International cash site leasing revenue was $53.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 2.9% compared to the year-earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international cash site leasing revenue increased 37.5%. On a constant currency basis, net organic growth for international cash leasing revenue was 11%. And in Brazil, it was over 12%. During the fourth quarter, Brazil represented 6.6% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding pass-through revenues, and 9.5% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. Cash site leasing revenue denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars was 10.3% of total cash site leasing revenue. International tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $36.5 million, an increase of 0.7% over the prior year or an increase of 32.1% eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rate. International tower cash flow margin was 68.4% compared to 69.9% in the year-earlier period. The decline in margins reflects the acquisition from Oi in Brazil of 1,641 sites in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $274.3 million, an increase of 2.9%. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.9%. Eliminating both the impact of FX changes and the impact of iDen churn, adjusted EBITDA growth was 10.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 68.3% in the year earlier period. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. AFFO decreased 0.2% to $181.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $181.5 million in the year earlier period. Eliminating the impact of both iDen churn and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, AFFO increased 11.2%. AFFO per share increased 2.9% to $1.43. Excluding the impact of both iDen churn and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, AFFO per share increased 14.4% over the year earlier period. We continue to selectively deploy capital towards portfolio growth. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 292 communication sites for $183.4 million in cash. We also built 100 sites during the fourth quarter. These additional sites are located in both domestic and international markets. We continue to invest in the land under our sites, as this is both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $26.4 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease term. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 73% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. Our press release contains our updated 2016 outlook. Our outlook for 2016 is the same as provided in our third quarter earnings release, adjusted to reflect the negative impact of recent and anticipated changes in the Brazilian and Canadian FX rate. Compared to the full year 2016 outlook that we provided in our third quarter press release: site leasing revenue has been negatively impacted by $16 million; tower cash flow by $10 million; adjusted EBITDA by $9 million; and AFFO by $10 million, due to changes in expected foreign exchange rates. As compared to our actual 2015 results, our projected full year 2016 site leasing revenue is being negatively impacted by $44 million as a result of our forecasted changes and foreign currency exchange rates. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $8.6 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $144 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.7 times. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.3 times. In October, we issued $500 million of new secured tower revenue securities through our existing SBA Tower Trust. The offering had a cash coupon of 3.156% and an anticipated maturity of five years. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the $280 million outstanding balance under our revolver and for general corporate purposes. Also during the quarter, we used cash on hand to repay the entire $160 million outstanding balance on our 2012 Term Loan A. At the end of the fourth quarter, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.9% and our weighted average maturity is approximately five years. During the quarter, we repurchased 482,000 shares of common stock for $50 million at an average price per share of $103.74. So far this quarter, we have repurchased 506,000 shares of common stock for $50 million at an average price per share of $98.65. Since the beginning of 2015, we have repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock for $500 million. This represents a reduction in shares outstanding of 3.5%. We currently have $650 million of authorization remaining under our stock repurchase program. Year-end shares outstanding were 125.7 million. We have no maturities in 2016. Our next maturity is $550 million of securitization notes due April 2017. We believe the prevailing rates to refinance these notes in the securitization market today would allow us to further reduce our weighted average interest rate. We feel good about our balance sheet strategy and our ability to refinance existing debt and access additional capital, if desired. While the broader credit markets have been volatile, our debt prices across our capital structure have reflected the stability in our underlying business. The majority of our debt trades at or above par. We intend to maintain our target leverage in the seven to seven and a half times range. Our primary capital allocation focus is portfolio growth that meets our investment return requirements, which could be augmented with share repurchases at prices that we believe are below intrinsic value, as we have done over the past several quarters. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. As you heard from Brendan earlier, we had a solid finish to 2015. Carriers were and are still very active with their networks, particularly with amendments to existing macro site infrastructure. Whether it was for AWS-1 or 700 megahertz deployments, refarming of spectrum for LTE or simply equipment additions to add capacity, the root cause of all this activity was the same, the demand from mobile data is outstripping network capabilities, even after all the benefits of spectral efficiency and improvements to technology. We believe this dynamic continues and as a result we remain very optimistic about the future. In the last several weeks, Cisco released its annual Global Mobile Data Traffic forecast, which is now for the period 2015 to 2020. For those of you that haven't read it, I recommend that you do. The projections for growth of mobile data traffic are startling. Mobile data traffic grew an estimated 74% in 2015 over 2014, just one year. Latin America grew 73% and North America grew 55%. Predictions for future growth are almost just as large. In the next five years, global mobile data traffic is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 53%, with Latin America growing 50% and North America by 42%, again on a compound annual basis. That means in five years, Cisco projects mobile data traffic in the U.S. to be almost 6 times what it is today. What makes the Cisco projections very believable are the base drivers for growth in mobile data traffic: increased smart device penetration, increased 4G connections and explosive growth in mobile video. Those things are all happening today and can be easily seen all around us. So how is all the traffic going to be handled? While there will be continuous improvements in technology and equipment and some additional spectrum deployed in the next five years, those items alone are projected to come nowhere close to handling the increased traffic. More infrastructure will be required and we will participate in that growth. Last year we saw continued evidence of this as to the need for more infrastructure in general and the importance of macro sites in particular. In 2015, a year which was below average in terms of revenue added per tower in the U.S., we signed a number of amendments equal to an excess of one-third of our entire U.S. tower portfolio. In every one of those cases, our customer spent CapEx to add or replace equipment to the macro site, including all the related services work. The large percentage of our sites which received additional investment from our customers is proof positive to us of the importance of additional infrastructure as a primary solution in our customers' efforts to satisfy the growing demand for mobile data. Turning to operating results. Carrier activity in the U.S. was steady in the fourth quarter and remains steady so far this year. As we mentioned, activity was mostly amendments and driven by continued AWS-1 and 700 megahertz deployments, as well as by refarming 2G spectrum to LTE. We have yet to see any meaningful activity so far this year from AWS-3, WCS or 2.5 gigahertz deployments, although the first quarter tends to be the least active, as carrier budgets are just getting rolled out. We expect to see more total activity in the second half of the year and our guidance at the top half of the range assumes it. Our backlogs are growing, so we believe the assumption is valid, but the confirmation will only come in the form of a pick-up in signed contracts. Longer-term, a number of additional sources of revenue are taking shape. The start of the 600 megahertz auction is right around the quarter, with billions in anticipated investment. We have begun to have a number of interesting conversations with potential carrier partners at FirstNet, around our inventory and tower space available. News from the Mobile World Congress includes a number of new connected car agreements. We believe connected cars plus increasing activity from machine-to-machine and Internet of Things providers add to the future growth profile of infrastructure here domestically and we think bodes particularly well for our portfolio. We continue to execute very well. We expanded our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margins by 80 points to 69.1% in the fourth quarter versus last year and our cash SG&A expenses remain very low as a percentage of cash revenue. We remain very focused on our margin performance as we view it as the best gauge of our operating performance. Internationally we had a very good fourth quarter, with constant currency gross same-tower cash revenue growth of 11%. Leasing activity occurred across all of our markets and with a variety of carriers. We built 78 new towers internationally. Demand for our international towers remains solid. Just under 70% of international leasing activity came from new leases on existing sites, with the balance coming from amendments. Our largest international market, Brazil, continues to perform well on a constant currency basis. It was our best same-tower gross organic growth market year-over-year, at over 12%. We continue to have operational success building new sites for our customers and securing new leases and amendments on our existing portfolio. While the current recession in Brazil certainly has some near-term impact on our customers there, we are still enjoying solid organic growth driven in part by escalators tied to Brazilian CPI. We feel very confident in the long-term potential for our Brazilian assets. Carrier networks in Brazil significantly lag those here in the U.S. 4G deployments are in the early stages. The deployment of 700 megahertz spectrum is still to come in Brazil. And the demographics of the population heavily support expanded wireless consumption. We are awaiting the release of President Rousseff's proposed telecom reforms, which, if they satisfactorily address wireline concession and other issues, could be the catalyst for wireless consolidation in the market. We believe that would be a positive for the market and could accelerate network development. As Mark mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our 7.0 times to 7.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target based on our expectations around organic growth, interest rates staying lower for longer and our excellent access to the capital markets. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain in great shape. Moody's recently reaffirmed our corporate credit rating with a stable outlook. SBA remains a favored issuer in several debt markets and our debt trades very well in the secondary market. Over the next 12 months, we expect our liquidity will be over $1.5 billion counting the cash we generate. As always, capital allocation remains a primary area of focus. Our first preference for capital allocation has always been and remains to invest in quality assets that meet our return hurdles, both domestically and internationally, as we believe quality asset growth at the right price is the best way to increase long-term shareholder value. There are a lot of small to mid-sized tower acquisition opportunities in the U.S. We will continue to look for new markets internationally, with our preference still to focus on the Western Hemisphere. As we've shown, however, if we do not believe those opportunities are at the right price or terms, we are quite comfortable using our leverage capacity to buy back our own stock when we believe the share price is below intrinsic value. We allocated capital to both portfolio growth and stock repurchases in the fourth quarter and have done so again in the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 we invested $1.3 billion in a mix of CapEx, acquisitions and stock repurchases. We continue to believe many opportunities will be available for M&A growth in the future, certainly enough to consume all of our investment capacity, but it will remain our focus to be disciplined and continuously weigh portfolio growth against stock repurchases for allocating capital. We believe our continued thoughtful approach to capital allocation will create significant additional value for our shareholders for years to come. We remain very excited about the prospects for SBA. The business continues to be steady and predictable. Operational excellence will remain a priority. We expect to continue to see good leasing activity from our domestic and international customers, with drivers including continued LTE coverage and capacity builds, a new public safety network, the 600 megahertz auction, the start of the AWS-3 spectrum deployments and, most importantly, projections around the growth in mobile data traffic. We will continue to invest to grow our portfolio in the U.S. and internationally. We will also continue to repurchase our stock, where we believe those repurchases will produce better results for our shareholders long-term. Wireless growth shows no signs of slowing. More infrastructure will be required, and we're excited to be a key participant in that unfolding story. Gloria, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: You do have a question from Spencer Kurn with Administrative (sic) [New Street Research] (22:58). Please go ahead.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Hey, guys. It's Spencer Kurn from New Street. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about your plan to monetize AWS-3 deployments. I'm not sure if you're having any discussions with carriers right now, but we're hearing some rumblings that some carriers plan to swap current AWS-3 radios for new radios that can accommodate both AWS-1 and AWS-3. These new radios may be lighter and, in certain cases, may not trigger amendments, from what we're hearing. I was just wondering if you could talk about how your contracts are structured and your plans for monetizing that deployment. Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. In all of our cases, Spencer, whenever there is an equipment change, there needs to be a discussion and potential negotiation over an increase in the rent. We have a slightly different understanding and view of what AWS-3 will look like. We think it's going to involve at least the same number of radio heads and potentially larger antennas than what is currently at play today. So, we actually expect that there will be a decent chunk of revenue generated on our towers and, I think, for the industry, as those deployments get going. They haven't really got going yet, but we do expect them to get started here in the near future.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Got it. Thanks. And one more, if I may, it looks like your international revenue had a big step-up sequentially. Are you seeing a greater level of activity than you originally expected or could you help explain what you're seeing on a constant currency basis? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I don't know if it was a whole lot more than expected, but we did have a really good fourth quarter and are off to a really good start, particularly in our Latin American markets, which would be both Central America, Brazil and Ecuador. We've had some pretty darn good lease-up.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just two, if I could. One, on the acquisition pipeline, can you just comment on what you're seeing there both in terms of available assets and then valuations in the market? And wondering whether you're still confident in your ability to hit the 5% to 10% portfolio growth you've seen over the past couple of years. And then just a follow-up on Spencer's question on AWS-3 builds, what are your latest expectations in terms of timing when you expect carriers to actually start deploying those bands? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll answer the second question first, which is sometime in the second half, Matthew, of this year. And I don't know whether that's going to be early in the second half or late in the second half. But I do expect to start seeing some activity then, just based on the cadence of the discussions that we're having. In terms of the M&A, in the U.S. markets, there's a lot of opportunities out there. Our biggest reason for not having a larger pipeline under contract is price, particularly when we can compare very easily the quality of those assets against our existing portfolio and see where our own stock trades. So we're being very selective. We're pursuing very high-quality assets. Not every asset that we're seeing is of the same quality and certainly doesn't demand the same price as the higher quality assets. So until prices begin to stabilize a little bit, and we're actually starting to see some evidence of that, I think you will continue to see a mix of the capital allocated by us to both M&A and stock repurchases. But, it's not a opportunity number issue. For us, it's purely a price issue. Next question?
Operator: Michael Rollins with Citi Research, your line is open.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could give us a revenue bridge for both the total company and domestic operations as you work through escalation, churn, the impact currency had, and then the impacts that acquisitions and internally-generated growth had on your operations. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mike, are you asking about a bridge from the previous year or previous quarter?
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. I'm sorry, just the fourth quarter would be very helpful. If you want to give the year or two, that's great, but the fourth quarter would be great.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As compared to the previous year?
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Year-over-year, similar to what your competitors provide.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, we can obviously offline go through a lot more detail with you, but our same tower organic growth rate year-over-year was 8%. So that's basically taking all of the recurring cash revenue, leasing revenue that we generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. That grew by 8% year-over-year, when you look at where we finished this quarter. Of that, domestically, we were closer to 7.5%. Internationally, we were more like 11%. A lot of that is driven from Brazil being higher. Brazil was north of 12%. And a lot of that growth in Brazil was driven materially by the escalators, which were close to 8%, on average, in terms of full year-over-full year. So when you look at domestic, the breakdown is usually about 3% to 3.5%. That's about what we had from escalators. And the balance is coming from organic growth. We did have about 1.5% from churn. So, our gross growth rate, again, domestically was 7.5%. Our net was 2.5%, 1.5% of normal churn and about 3.5% from iDen churn.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And there'll still be a gap period in there that comes from acquisition.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. In terms of absolute dollars, we obviously add inorganic growth as well through acquisitions. I think it'd probably be easier for us to discuss some of the details offline, but there is also FX impacts obviously on the international, too.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And just then to bridge that now, as you look at the first quarter in the year, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about organic cash growth from the first quarter for the domestic business and what the year looks like?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We're looking at next year, the full year, if you look at the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to fourth quarter of 2015, it implies a gross organic growth rate of roughly 9%, similar to what we said last time. This is all on a constant currency basis. And on a on net basis, that's about 7.5%, because we expect about 1.5% churn.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And what's embedded in your 1Q guidance?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In our first quarter guidance, we're expecting it will be fairly similar to the fourth quarter.
Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Amir with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. I wanted to touch a bit in terms of your outlook with respect to the year. On your commentary, you indicated that you expect to see more activity in the back half of the year, and that's sort of factored into the upper end of your guidance range. How should we think about the level of activity that you're considering in terms of the back half of the year, that's factored in? And perhaps, what gives you that confidence in terms of either the bookings levels that you folks are seeing or anything along those lines to sort of put that in terms of your guidance and expectations? Thanks a lot.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're seeing an increase in the backlog, Amir. And we're on the cusp of some additional projects that we think are ready to break loose that we've had some conversations with. But again, to be clear, while the backlogs are growing, we're going to need to continue to see some improvement in the actual signed revenue to get to the high-end of the guidance range. We think it's all there. As I say, the backlogs are growing. The conversations are all around additional business, but we're not going to claim victory over that until we actually have it signed up.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. And then as you'd mentioned in some of the earlier questions and given the expectations for a potential activity pick-up in the back half of the year, how should we think about the state of the demand curve with some of these new spectrum builds, with some of this new activity sort of transitioning from the back-half of the year into the following year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the carryover will be strong, because all of what we've talked about will just be getting underway, particularly the AWS-3. And I think we're talking about multi-year deployments on these new spectrum bands, WCS. The WCS, I think it's been fairly well publicized that AT&T has sought some relief against some potential interference issues, which has actually kept that deployment down. That, hopefully, is on track, looks to be on track to get resolved here in the not too distant future. And then by saying, by mentioning 2.5 G work, basically of course that means we haven't really seen much of anything from Sprint yet. And that we don't necessarily need to see anything there for our guidance, but we do think over time that if they're going to fulfill what they've publically stated, that some activity is going to come from that. But so but this is...
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is multi-year work that we're discussing.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much for the incremental color.
Operator: David Barden with Bank of America, please go ahead.
David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Thanks. So, Jeff, maybe you've touched on this just now to a degree. But I guess my question was with respect to the question marks around the backlog building and the trigger pulling on the signed revenue, what you think that that gap is. I guess it's no secret the whole market is sitting here struggling trying to figure out are capital dollars all going to small cells, is everything kind of evaporating in terms of the macro cell site demand picture. And this kind of waiting around is adding to that conversation, what the real reason is. Is it we're waiting for the FCC to approve this AT&T build? If you could kind of give us some color around that topic, it would be super helpful. And then the second thing was I think your comments about the FirstNet RFP were interesting. It's the first we've heard that something's actually going on. Could you actually share what it is? What are we thinking about here? Is it going to be D Block radios being deployed on behalf of the FirstNet guys? Is that what we're talking about? Or any color about what's really going on there would be helpful. Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, you asked a number of questions there, David. First on the macro sites, I would think or would hope that when people hear that we actually touched and amended and processed amendments equal to over 33% of our U.S. portfolio last year that the importance of the macro sites couldn't be clearer. In terms of the triggering, it's not any real mystery it takes time to process applications and amendments, so there is no stair function that has to occur there. It's just the normal course. Things are building. They should take three months to six months to work through the pipeline. And if at all it continues to go in that direction, it'll all turn out the way that we have assumed that it will. There's no particular thing that's holding things back. It's just the ordinary way that carriers work, particularly when they come out of the end of the year and just begin to start rolling out their full year budgets and plans, which is happening as we speak. Now, you asked one more question, which...
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: FirstNet.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, FirstNet. Yeah, we've had a number of discussions very broadly, not getting to equipment, but just generally where do we have capacity, let's talk about what might happen if we come back to you with a FirstNet. And the reason for that is the proposal that has gone out by FirstNet to pick a partner, they're looking basically for network solutions. And the folks who respond to that are going to want to be able to include towers where they need to do so to put their best foot forward.
David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. So this is basically a brand new network incrementally to everything we see in the demand picture today?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, not necessarily. I believe there will be equipment sharing – not equipment sharing as much as RAN sharing or Radisys sharing, much like we were prepared to do as an industry when LightSquared was on the table. And the reason that FirstNet has gone out with this RFP and seeking partners is because they don't want to build their own network. So it will not be a standalone network. It's certainly not looking that way at this time. But it is looking like they want to partner with one or more existing players, who as part of their proposal will offer up network architecture. And we've actually been approached as to how we might play in all that.
David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good. All right. Thanks, guys.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep.
Operator: Ric Prentiss with Raymond James, please go ahead.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good evening, guys.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Ric.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. First, thanks for putting the numbers in the call close together and putting out the supplement. That's good to have that extra detail. Let's go to Brazil for a second, if we could. Jeff, you mentioned the telecom reform and landline concessions. Telecom Italia has talked a little bit about it. Telefônica Brasil talked a little bit. Can you share with us what your thoughts are as far as what might be happening down there and the timeline?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I know there is a big effort underway by all of the carriers that are subject to the wireline concession to get relief from that because the universal service obligations are quite onerous. TIM is not subject to those. Oi is. So any kind of combination – and this is me speaking and not necessarily attributable to any of those folks, but is going to be hampered by the uncertainty around that wireline. And so I think that point has been made very clear by a number of people and that has gotten President Rousseff's ear. And hopefully that is something that gets cleared up or at least better cleared up when she does release these telecom reforms.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And any thought on when that timeline might be playing out?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I thought I saw something that talked about the end of March, but I can't tell you that for certain.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: But it feels like it's in the shorter term, rather than what's been imponderable for a quite a long period of time. Seems that it's getting addressed, possibly.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, yeah. This is the first time I think there has been some serious thinking and potentially proposals around this issue.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sure. Some other questions on Brazil. How do you guys come up with your assumptions on FX that you build into the first quarter and the year? Obviously it's been really hard to peg what's going on on the Brazilian real, but as we look at it, it's been in the low 4s. It's been here in the high 3s. It's 3.95 today. What's your process to think through how to set the stage for what your guidance has?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it is partially scientific and partially not, Ric. Last year, we took the tact of using the spot rate for all of our reports and our guidance, and that didn't work so well. We were chasing that all the way down all year long. So this time we've looked at some consensus, not necessarily the forward curve.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, it's not the forward curve. We've looked at what many of the economists from a variety of the banks that we use have projected. And most of the economists project further weakening to the exchange rate during 2016. So we basically used a forward assumption for the balance of the year that's in line with the median of the projected forward rates that were put out by several of those large banks. And our hope is that that will significantly reduce the magnitude of any future guidance revisions due to FX changes.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we're trying to put ourself in a position where we are not chasing FX call to call.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: But having said that, Ric, one of the things that the implied further weakening during 2016 is substantially lower than what we've experienced over the last two years and thus the impact is anticipated to be much lower than we saw during those periods.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think that's an important point. I think folks should focus on the percentage of our revenue that now comes out of Brazil. It's below 10%. And while we are projecting a decline from today to the 4.20 we used in the full-year guidance. That is well below the mid-40s or high-40s that we saw Q4 2015 to 2014. So we're looking at a year, not only this year and then even more so beyond, where this should have less and less of an impact.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I appreciate you guys breaking out the Brazilian site lease versus the pass-throughs, because I guess I think I heard that Brazil was like 6.6% of the real leasing revenue, 9.5% if you include the pass-throughs, but pass-throughs obviously are netted numbers, is that the right way to be thinking about it?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's correct. That's why we're breaking it out. So, on a net basis, if you just strip out pass-throughs from our entire business and look at what percentage of cash revenue Brazil represents, in that case, it's only 6.5%, so less and less of an impact.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And one last Brazil question. I apologize, but it's such a key topic for a lot of investors and concern. I think you mentioned 8% was what the escalator component was in the over 12% growth in fourth quarter.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: What's the thought that you're going to see escalators contribute in Brazil and what you think Brazil's growth rate is in 2016?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Our projections for full-year guidance would imply Brazil growing at about 13% on a same-tower basis, if you compared Q4 of 2016 to 2015. Of that, we would expect a little over 8% of that comes from escalators. Obviously today, when you look at the current CPI equivalent, IPCA, index down there, it's actually well above 10.5%, but given the timing of when our escalators takes place and the forward curve around inflationary rates in Brazil, which is what we've used for our assumptions, we expect that the blended impact to our fourth quarter results over the previous year would be about 8%.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It'll have a bigger impact, Ric, how it turns out for 2017. The consensus is actually that the inflation rate comes down over the course of the year. Obviously, that isn't the direction that it has been heading, but even if it continued at the high level because of the timing, as Brendan said, you wouldn't necessarily have a big pickup this year, but it would be a much different base for 2017.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The relative materiality of those couple percentage points, given what we talked about before, which is the 6.5% of the total leasing revenue that's subject to this, it's just not, frankly, that material. But if the inflationary rates stayed higher, there is a small opportunity for pickup. Unfortunately, that probably means that the FX rates are not performing in line with what we've assumed either, but we'll have to see.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I appreciate having the tailwind. That certainly is much better than chasing our tails.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Definitely, we agree.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Gloria, are there any other questions?
Operator: Absolutely. You do have a question from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Are there any other questions? You guys usually go for an hour and a half. What do you expect? Come on.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're usually camped on that first queue. I was missing you.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I know. I thought Ric was going to take all my questions. Two that I have left, any pick-up at this point in the pace of signed contracts and, if not, is that sort of standard for January and February?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. No, no pick-up from Q4 levels, but that's absolutely standard for this time. I mean, we know for a fact that at least two of the big four are still finalizing budgets.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And that usually starts to pick up in sort of March into April?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then what drove better site development – well, better than what we were looking for, site development revenue? It seems to holding up better than expected, given the activity level that's going on.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It was particularly helped – it's unfortunate to say, in a way, by the extreme amount of iDen churn that we had in the fourth quarter. What comes along with that is significant work around the removal of equipment at those sites. And so I hate to say a part of the reason that it was up was actually due to that. And so if you look at our guidance for our services business for next year, you'll see that it actually suggests a decline over this year, because items like that will not be repeating.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, good. Last thing, the buyback, a little bit lower, despite the stock being off; should we think of that being offset by the acquisition you made in the U.S. or how should we think about the buyback going forward?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think if you look at the combined CapEx that we spent since our last call, I think it's pretty healthy. I think, Phil, you were anticipating $150 million. We did $100 million, plus maybe some acquisitions that you weren't thinking about.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, that ought to be, I guess, loosely the way people ought to think about it in terms of absolute dollars. There are a couple things around the stock repurchases. We're managing somewhat to leverage. We don't want to take leverage up too high, notwithstanding how good we believe the stock price to be. But we also run into blackout periods that don't allow us to be in the market all the time. But with earnings now here, we get to reset all those blackout windows and we get to take a forward look again.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. I think if I got it right, you said that your amendment activity was about eight to one versus new collocations, perhaps some perspective on you're likely to stay here or is that going to normalize more over the next few quarters? And then, we got a lot of 5G hype out of Mobile World Congress. But as you think about it, have you done much work thinking about what that might ultimately mean for your business, as looking at some of these microwave frequencies and the installations that might be needed on the macro towers? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Clearly, the macros are going to be a key backbone in all that system. And we would expect, Simon, additional equipment comes out of it. We haven't seen any specs yet that would allow us to get more specific than that. The standards aren't approved yet. So, we really don't see what the equipment could look like yet. Obviously, they're talking at higher frequencies, which is going to need several different types of architecture. But, in all cases, we believe the macro site is kind of the base off which all that occurs.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And you have some microwave already for backhaul for some carriers and so forth, right?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We do. We do.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And, Simon, just on your first question about the eight to one. The eight to one is a representation of the number of agreements signed. So, the absolute number of agreements in terms of the revenue mix, the amendments contributed 62%. Those are just domestic numbers. 62% of the revenue's signed up. But over eight to one in terms of its comparison to actual number of agreements signed that were amendments versus leases.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And we think that continues because there is a lot of refarming of 2G spectrum to LTE that's going on. AWS-3, when it does break, is going to, I think, certainly come in the form of heavy amendments; WCS, the same. 2.5 G, when Sprint does get going there, the first thing is going to be to provide that service to their existing macro site. I don't know if it'll be eight to one, Simon, but I do believe that it will continue to be predominantly amendments as we move through this year.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: You do have a question from Nick Del Deo. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson: I had two regarding some internal initiatives that you had talked about in the past. So first in Brazil, you've had the aspiration of developing a services organization where you can develop a large number of your towers (52:18) each year. So I was wondering. Where does that stand? What sort of success have you had? What's the demand been like for new towers down there? And second, in the wake of selling ExteNet, I think you had talked about trying to develop some small cell development capabilities in-house. So, again, where does that stand? Are you at a point where you could actually start bidding for business or is it too soon for that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. In Brazil, Nick, we are pretty well fully staffed up for our new build efforts now. We fell a little bit short of our goals last year. What did we build in Brazil last year, Brendan?
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We built – don't have the exact number – 150 sites, approximately.
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: Yeah.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have the capabilities in place to double that and more, Nick. So the question is do we have the business? I mean, obviously, the rezoning takes time, things like that. But we are ready to go and capable of producing much larger numbers than that. And, in fact, our guidance of the towers that we expect to build this year does include a larger number in Brazil than what we built last year. So, the other question was on small cells. We are adding some folks, some experienced people from the industry. Our focus, though, is not really in the outdoor space. It is more of the indoor space. And it's focused on assets that we already have relationships with, either through ownership or management, where we tend to have the exclusive ability to manage the telecommunications activities around those assets. We actually have bid on a number of things. And we don't have anything material to talk about. I don't know that we'll have anything material to talk about this year, but we are making some good progress.
Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson: In terms of assets where you say you already have relationships, are you referring to, say, we have rooftop management agreements, stuff of that nature?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, where we have that. We actually have some agreements where we manage large portfolios of land for a variety of different owners, railroads, large box department stores. We actually have states where we manage all of their telecom infrastructure. So, all those are very good opportunities for us to go in on a negotiated exclusive basis and help them with whatever they'd like to do in that area. And that's where we're focused.
Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson: Okay. That's great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. You mentioned that a portion of the amendment activity is being driven by the migrations away from 2G networks. Could you just help provide a little color as to precisely how you're getting paid there? Is it simply contractual provisions that they're changing technology or repurposing spectrum? Or is there actually an augmentation of physical gear that is triggering the amendments?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's no contractual provision, Brett, that contemplated or was agreed to in advance that says, okay, if we change out 2G equipment for 4G, the following will happen. So it basically involves in every case a discussion and a negotiation. And we're getting a variety of results, meaning cases where there's an actual reduction in equipment, which isn't very often, we're not charging for that. We're not reducing rent, but we're not charging anything additional for that. And then where they're changing out where they actually end up with more remote radio heads or, more likely, different antennas which are bigger for LTE, then there's an amendment fee.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then second question, if you don't mind. A few weeks ago, everyone got really concerned about some misinformation about what Sprint might be doing with its network. And I think Sprint did a good job of clarifying the nature of its relationships with tower companies. But it seems to have stimulated a discussion around whether the conversations that you're having with all of your carrier partners could potentially be evolving. And I'm curious, as you speak to carriers about new frequency bands and things they're thinking about doing with their network over the coming years, are you finding that they're asking for anything different with regards to the nature of their leases and their leasing relationships relative to what you've typically seen in the past?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not really. We've been at this a long time. And I think people would be mistaken if they think that carriers didn't negotiate hard throughout history on all this. And that really hasn't changed. Their needs are changing a little bit, so we're talking about different things. But in terms of any new way of dealing with each other, it's always a spirited negotiation and we both end up somewhere in the middle. And that hasn't changed. That's been the way it's gone ever since we got into this business.
Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Mike McCormack with Jefferies, your line is open.
Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Yes, thanks. Jeff, maybe just a quick comment on how you see sort of the 5G ecosystem. I know it's early think about, but how the architecture of that works and whether or not that changes your thought process on more small cell outdoor environments.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I have not seen enough yet, Mike, to really have developed a lot of good and clear thoughts on that. It's clearly going to involve some more points of presence, given the frequencies involved. But if it goes the way that existing small cells outdoor appear to be going, which is predominantly fiber and needing to become a fiber company to participate in all that, I don't know that that's going to change or cause us to change our thinking.
Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest, please go ahead.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two, if I may, guys. For the guidance I just wanted to make sure, have you changed any of your thoughts around the range for the amortization of capital contributions on the tower augmentation? And then number two, in your press release I can kind of guess at a high level what you're intending to do, but when you say intend to spend additional capital in 2016 on acquiring revenue-producing assets, can you perhaps give us a little bit more of a look underneath the covers there with regard to what you're thinking about? Because it seems to be new language and I'm just interested as to what you might be leaning toward, if you will, either geographically or different types of assets. Thanks.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Michael, on your first question on the amortization of the augmentation reimbursements, we really haven't made any changes since our assumptions a few months ago as to what we'll see in 2016.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and on the second question, that is actually not new language. That's been in there for years I believe. And basically the purpose of the language is to reinforce our statements that we intend to stay capitalized within our target leverage range. As we grow throughout the year, we stay in that leverage range, additional investment capacity is created and that we would look to spend that on portfolio growth, which has been and continues to be our first priority.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes, a couple of questions. You talked in detail of iDEN churn. And I wondered if you could also kind of flesh out what's happening with respect to WiMAX churn and other churn (1:01:15)? Secondly, for the U.S., you gave an interesting stat about 33% of sites touched last year. And is there a percentage you could share with respect to Brazil?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We could, Jonathan. I don't have it handy because it's going to be much less. We are 70% leases there versus amendments. That's on a revenue basis. So it might actually be eight to one the opposite way outside of the United States, but we can get that for you if you'd like. And in terms of the other churn, it's almost entirely a combination of Clearwire, Leap and Metro, all of which we've expected, anticipated and there it is.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then lastly, on international M&A, just any thoughts on or predilections with respect to purchasing other developers versus doing a sale-leaseback deal carrier transaction as a way of expanding in, say, other parts of South America?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We'll look at all opportunities. Developer towers are going to be of higher quality, we would hope. Carrier towers, much like in the United States, were not built for our industry, so they tend to need a little bit more work, but nothing that we haven't taken on in the past and done well with. So I do think, though, unlike in the United States, you're probably not going to see, at least in South America, as many smaller, independent acquisition opportunities. They're growing. And it's exciting to see how many new little tower developers are starting out, which ultimately will be opportunities to buy. But if you want to move the needle quickly, the way to do that is still going to be the carrier transaction.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Mark C. DeRussy, CFA - Vice President, Finance: Gloria, we're going to take one more question if there is one.
Operator: No, sir. There are no additional questions at this time.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, great. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us. Hopefully, the switch in the time, everyone appreciates we basically have done this out of the requests of our investors to tighten things up a little bit. And we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings release. Thank you.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. At this time I will turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark C. DeRussy - Vice President-Finance & Head-Investor Relations: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2015 and 2016 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, November 5, 2015, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted to our website, sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Brendan to comment on our third quarter results.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another very strong quarter in all areas. We were above the midpoint of our guidance for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and would have been at or above the high end for each of those items using the foreign currency exchange rates assumed in our last guidance. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $372 million or a 6.6% increase over the third quarter of 2014. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total GAAP site leasing revenue would have increased 13.1% over the year-earlier period. Changes in the Brazilian and Canadian exchange rates during the third quarter versus the rates assumed in our guidance negatively impacted leasing revenue by $2.2 million. Domestic cash site leasing revenue was $306.9 million in the third quarter, an increase of 8.1% compared to the year-earlier period. On a gross basis, organic domestic cash site leasing revenue growth was 8%. On a net basis, including the negative impacts of 1.6% from iDen decommissioning and 1.4% from normal churn, organic growth was 5%. Domestic tower cash flow for the third quarter was $251 million, an increase of 9.7% over the year-earlier period. Domestic tower cash flow margin was 81.8%, compared to 80.6% in the year-earlier period. Approximately 60% of domestic lease up revenue came from amendments and the big four carriers represented 90% of total new domestic leasing activity. Verizon and T-Mobile continue to be the most active carriers, while AT&T once again showed a slight sequential increase in activity. International cash site leasing revenue was $53.5 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of 9.7% compared to $48.8 million in the year-earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international cash site leasing revenue would have increased 51.2%. On a constant currency basis, net organic growth for international cash leasing revenue was 11.5%. In Brazil, which represented 9.9% of global cash site leasing revenue in the third quarter, constant currency organic growth was 13%. Site leasing revenue not denominated in U.S. dollars represented 11% of total site leasing revenue in the quarter. International tower cash flow for the third quarter was $36.6 million, an increase of 4.5% over the prior year or an increase of 41.2% eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Tower cash flow margin was 68.5% compared to 71.9% in the year earlier period. The decline in margins reflects the acquisition from Oi in Brazil of 1,641 sites in the fourth quarter of last year and an increase in pass-through related costs which are included in both revenue and cost of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $275.2 million, an increase of 8.2%. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 12.8%. Changes in the Brazilian and Canadian exchange rates during the third quarter versus the rates assumed in our guidance negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $1.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 69% in the third quarter compared to 67.5% in the year earlier period. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 5.8% $183.9 million in the third quarter compared to $173.8 million in the year earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates AFFO would have increased 12.9%. Changes in the Brazilian and Canadian exchange rates during the third quarter versus the rates assumed in our guidance negatively impacted AFFO by $1.2 million. AFFO per share increased 7.5% to $1.43. On a constant currency basis, AFFO per share would have increased 15% over the year earlier period. Net loss for the third quarter of 2015 was $155.9 million or $1.23 per share. Net loss for the third quarter included a $112.1 million loss on the currency related remeasurement of a U.S. dollar denominated intercompany loan with our Brazilian subsidiary and a $56.7 million impairment of fiber assets acquired in the 2012 Mobilitie transaction. In the third quarter, we acquired 225 communication sites for $79.2 million in cash. We also built 127 sites during the third quarter. These additional sites are located in both domestic and international markets. We continue to invest in the land under our sites as this is both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $14.5 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 73% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. Last night's press release contains our updated 2015 outlook and our initial 2016 outlook. Our outlook for 2015 is largely the same as provided in our second quarter earnings release but has been adjusted to account for our outperformance in the third quarter and the negative impact of changes in the Brazilian and Canadian FX rates. Compared to the full year 2015 outlook we provided in our second quarter press release, the midpoint of site leasing revenue in our updated 2015 outlook has been negatively impacted by $7.1 million as a result of adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Our revised 2015 outlook assumes consolidated constant currency gross organic leasing revenue growth of just over 8% and approximately 7% net of non-iDen churn. I'd like to now turn to our initial full-year 2016 outlook. Our initial 2016 outlook assumes consolidated constant currency gross organic leasing revenue growth of 9% and 7.5% net of churn. This growth rate is calculated as the anticipated percentage increase in recurring, normal cash leasing revenue from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding growth from acquisitions, new tower builds and the impact of certain other tower leasing revenue items such as pass-through expenses grossed up into leasing revenue, amortization of augmentation reimbursements and our managed business. These other tower leasing revenue items represent approximately 10% of our 2015 cash leasing revenue. The methodology used for this calculation is consistent with how we have always historically calculated same tower revenue growth for full year guidance. We calculate our projected organic growth rate using fourth quarter over prior year fourth quarter, because we believe this most accurately represents the organic leasing activity actually taking place during the full year 2016. Domestically in 2016, we believe our organic leasing revenue growth will come from continued steady contributions from Verizon and T-Mobile, and increased activity levels with AT&T. We have not included any material contributions to our organic growth from Sprint and a reduced services contribution due to present uncertainty with the timing of their future network investments. Although we do believe we will see some activity from Sprint in 2016. Our 2016 outlook assumes domestic gross organic cash site leasing revenue growth of 9%, an increase over what we are now anticipating for full year 2015. We believe domestic leasing activity will build throughout 2016, and early 2016 actual results will reflect second half of 2015 leasing activity, which we now expect in terms of signed business to be below our year-ago expectations, and as evidenced by the slightly over 8% organic gross cash flow growth for 2015 that I mentioned earlier. Internationally, we are expecting constant currency gross organic cash site leasing revenue growth of nearly 11%, which is approximately the same as we now expect for the full year 2015. We are carefully watching the economic and political pressures currently affecting our customers in Brazil. While next year is predicted to be a continued recession in Brazil and our outlook is therefore conservative, continued network investment remains critical in Brazil, and thus we expect our Brazilian assets will be a meaningful contributor to our organic growth for years to come. Last night's press release also includes a reconciliation of the midpoints of our 2016 outlook to our 2015 outlook for GAAP site leasing revenue. At the midpoints, our guidance includes the addition of $117 million in new cash leasing revenue. Approximately $25 million of this incremental leasing revenue is expected to come through portfolio growth, which includes new tower builds and the impact of acquisitions consummated in 2015 as of last night or pending under contract. The balance of the growth is anticipated to come from new leases and amendments signed up on our towers, and existing contractual escalators net of the negative impact of normal churn. This growth in full year leasing revenue is made up of leases and amendments commenced during 2015 for which a full year's rent was not recognized during 2015 as well as new leases and amendments expected to be signed up and commenced during 2016. The variance in foreign currency rate assumptions between the 2015 outlook, which contemplates an average Brazilian exchange of BRL 3.33 to $1, and the 2016 outlook which contemplates an average Brazilian exchange rate of BRL 3.85 to $1, has negatively impacted site leasing revenue in the initial 2016 outlook by $28 million. This represents a 1.9% headwind in 2016 relative to the midpoint of expected 2015 leasing revenue. The reconciliation also includes two items expected to impact comparable results in 2016 but not thereafter. The first is iDen. While Sprint's rights to early terminate iDen leases have ended, there will be a carry-over impact from iDen leases that churned throughout 2015 representing a year-over-year loss of approximately $20 million in revenue. This represents a 1.4% headwind in 2016 relative to the midpoint of expected 2015 leasing revenue. We are also projecting a $14 million reduction in full-year leasing revenue associated with a decline in the amortization of reimbursed augmentation CapEx. As you'll recall, when we augment a tower to accommodate additional equipment being added by one of our customers to that tower, we typically are reimbursed the vast majority of those expenditures. Those capital contributions, which are essentially rents prepaid by the tenant, are recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet and are amortized into site leasing revenue over the initial term of the lease agreement or, in the case of amendments, over the remaining current term of the associated lease agreement. The significant levels of leasing activity experienced in late 2013 through mid-2014 resulted in much higher amounts of augmentation CapEx and ultimately much higher amounts of amortized reimbursements. The impact of the amortization of these expenditures typically lags the timing of the leasing activity by about a year. And we saw peak levels of this revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015. We've seen this amortization revenue steadily decrease throughout 2015 in conjunction with lower leasing and augmentation activity. We don't expect to see future material year-over-year declines in augmentation revenue after 2016, and we could see an increase in 2017 based on our estimates of increased U.S. leasing activity in 2016. Amortization of augmentation CapEx reimbursement in 2016 is estimated to represent approximately 2% of 2016 estimated site leasing revenue, levels similar to that of 2013 and 2014. We are excited about our opportunities in 2016. Our 2016 outlook demonstrates the underlying strength of our core business and provides for ample opportunity for improvement through organic growth and additional investment which we intend to do to stay within our leverage targets. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark C. DeRussy - Vice President-Finance & Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $8.5 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $121 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.6 times. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.4 times. On October 14, we issued $500 million of new secured tower revenue securities through our existing SBA Tower Trust. The offering had a cash coupon of 3.156% and an anticipated maturity of five years. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the $280 million outstanding balance under our revolver as well as for general corporate purposes. At the end of the quarter and pro forma for this financing, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.8% and our weighted average maturity is approximately five years. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $250 million at an average price per share of $113.87. Quarter end shares outstanding were $126.1 million (sic) [126.1 million]. Since the beginning of 2015, we have repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock for $400 million, at an average price per share of $114.27. This represents a reduction in shares outstanding of just under 3%. We currently have $750 million of authorization remaining under our stock repurchase program. We feel really good about our balance sheet strategy, and additional capital if needed remains readily available. We intend to maintain our target leverage in the 7 times to 7.5 times range. Our primary capital allocation focus is portfolio growth that meets our investment return requirements, which could be augmented with share repurchases if prices we believe are below intrinsic value as we have done this year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our results last night, we executed well in the third quarter with key metrics coming in above the midpoints of our guidance and at or above the high ends using the currency assumptions in our last guidance. We had many areas of operational success. Of particular note, we expanded our industry leading adjusted EBITDA margins by 150 basis points to 69% versus last year. Our industry leading tower cash flow margin grew to 80% and we grew our AFFO per share 15% versus last year on a constant currency basis. We're very focused on our margin performance as we view it as a gauge of our operating performance. We continued to see stable leasing activity, both domestically and internationally. And our services business had another strong quarter. In the U.S., activity levels with Verizon and T-Mobile continue to be steady as they invest in their networks, deploying new spectrum, filling in coverage gaps, and adding further network density in order to handle the never-slowing pace of mobile data consumption growth. AT&T increased their contribution to our leasing results for the second consecutive quarter, and early indications are that we will see continued increases in leasing levels with AT&T in 2016. Domestic applications are growing, although in terms of signed domestic business year-to-date, we are behind our expectations of a year ago as Brendan mentioned earlier. Activity levels with Sprint remained very low. They publicly discussed increased investment in their network as early as next year and we're excited about the prospects of what that could contribute to our growth. However, as Brendan mentioned earlier, given a lack of clarity around the scope and timing of Sprint's network investment, we've included very little incremental contribution from them in our initial 2016 outlook. We'll obviously continue to monitor their network plans closely. Internationally, we had a very good third quarter with gross same tower cash revenue growth of almost 12%, a mix of leasing activity across all of our markets and with a variety of carriers, and building 92 towers internationally. Demand for our international towers remained solid, just under 70% of international leasing activity came from new leases on existing sites with the balance coming from amendments. Claro and Telefónica were the two most active international carriers during the quarter. Our largest international market, Brazil, continues to perform well on a constant currency basis. It was our best same tower gross organic growth market year-over-year at 13%. We continue have operational success building new sites for our customers and securing new leases and amendments on our existing portfolio. While the current recession in Brazil certainly has some near-term impact on our customers there, we are still enjoying solid organic growth. We feel very confident in the long-term potential of our Brazilian assets. Carrier networks in Brazil significantly lag those here in the U.S. 4G deployments have just barely begun. The deployment of 700 megahertz spectrum in Brazil is still to come, and the demographics of the population heavily support expanding wireless consumption. Near term, we expect Brazil to be under continued economic pressure. But these facts and many others support many years of wireless network in the future. In keeping with our desire to seek out new international investment opportunities that provide long-term growth prospects and increase shareholder value, we're pleased to announce that we've entered into Ecuador through an acquisition of 130 sites. This transaction will leverage our institutional and cultural knowledge of Latin America, a region which we continue to believe will be a strong long-term driver for SBA. We believe Ecuador will be very similar in operation and results to our Central American markets where we have enjoyed tremendous success. The wireless market in Ecuador consists of three carriers, Telefónica, America Movil and CNT. The population is about 16 million which would rank as the fifth most populous state in the U.S. Ecuador has a mobile penetration rate of 120% almost entirely using 2G and 3G technology with very little 4G as of yet. Our initial 130 towers are basically brand new, averaging a year old with 1.1 tenants per tower. Telefónica is the anchor tenant on all of these sites. The currency in Ecuador is the U.S. dollar. Beyond these initial 130 towers, we have developed a backlog of new tower opportunities and expect to continue to expand within this new market. Over time, we believe it will be a 500 to 1,000 tower market for us. We will continue to look for new markets internationally with our preference still to focus on the Western Hemisphere. We are maintaining our 7.0 times to 7.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target based on our expectations around organic growth, interest rates staying lower for longer, and our excellent access to the capital markets. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain in great shape. SBA remains a favored issuer in several debt markets. The secured financing we completed in October added to our liquidity and reduced our average cost of debt. With our solid access to financing, capital allocation remains a top priority for the management team and for me personally. We expect to have over $1 billion of capacity to invest next year within our target leverage range. Our liquidity will be over $1.5 billion, counting the cash we generate. Our portfolio growth goals continue to be 5% to 10% per year and I'm confident we'll hit at least the low end of that goal in 2015. Our first preference for capital allocation remains to invest in quality assets that meet our return hurdles both domestically and internationally as we believe quality asset growth at the right price is the best way to increase long-term shareholder value. However, if we do not believe those right opportunities exist, we are quite comfortable using our leverage capacity to buy back or our own stock when we believe the share price is below intrinsic value as we've demonstrated during 2015. Most of our acquisition growth in 2015 will be in the U.S., although the pricing environment continues to be very competitive. We have passed on more U.S. acquisitions this year than we have done either due to asset quality, price or lease terms. We continue to believe many opportunities will be available for M&A growth in the future, certainly enough to consume all of our investment capacity if we so desired, but it will remain our focus to be disciplined and continuously reevaluate our options for allocating capital. That discipline this year has resulted in approximately two-thirds of our almost $1.2 billion of investment dollars going into capital expenditures and acquisitions, and the remainder into stock repurchases. This year, we have spent $400 million on stock repurchases, reducing our share count by 3.5 million shares thus far, at prices we believe were well below intrinsic value. This is a return of capital to shareholders of approximately 3% on a market cap basis. We have many options to invest capital. We believe our continued thoughtful approach to capital allocation will create significant additional value for our shareholders for years to come. As we head into the final stretch of 2015, we now start to look forward to 2016. The years ahead hold many exciting prospects for SBA. Our core business is very strong and expected to stay that way. Operational excellence will remain a priority. We expect to see increased leasing activity from our domestic customers. In the U.S., we expect to see continued progress around a new public safety network, the 600 megahertz auction, and the start of AWS-3 spectrum deployments. We will continue to invest to grow our portfolio in the U.S. and internationally. And it is likely we will add one or more geographic markets to our portfolio in 2016. We will continue to carefully allocate capital to produce the best results for our shareholders long term. Wireless growth around the globe continues to trend higher, opportunities will be plentiful and we are excited to be a key component of that phenomenon. We look forward to reporting our final 2015 results on our next call. And, Tony, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. First question will come from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess two questions. Obviously, the stock is down 8.5% because the guidance for AFFO growth of 4% compares to where, I think, the Street consensus was, was closer to 12% to 13%. And I think people are trying to figure out the bridge. And I think, Brendan, maybe you gave us – if I take that 4% and I add back 2% currency, and then I add back 2% for the lower amortization, which is non-cash, I'm up to more like 8%. And then if I took the $1 billion of investing capital and I bought back 7% of the stock, I'd be at 15% growth or I could be buying tower stocks. But maybe you could kind of – if you have a sense of it, kind of waterfall this for us so we can kind of bridge where maybe the Street was and where you are and what the reasons are. And then I guess, just – well, let's focus on that first. Thanks.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Well, there's a few things. I think a lot of them were covered in the press release or in the comments I made earlier. But let's just kind of walk through them quickly. When you get – when you start off with leasing revenue, as we indicated, it is negatively impacted by a few things. We've got augmentation reimbursements, which is the reimbursement or the amortization of reimbursements of capital that we're spending to upgrade our towers for tenants. We expect that to be down and that's due to less activity, really less leasing activity during the year from our customers. So, that's about a 1% headwind to revenue and more to AFFO. The iDen churn year-over-year represents almost 1.5% to revenue and again more to AFFO. That's $20 million, and that's because the vast majority of the iDen leases that are churning off this year churned off October 1. And when you take the remaining three quarters of revenue that we've recognized during this year, that we will not have next year, that obviously impacts the growth as well. FX is a huge impact as well. We're looking at about $15 million on the AFFO line of negative impact from that as well. As you go further down, we obviously have increases in some of our direct leasing cost, but not abnormal. Some of those come through acquisitions that we did and some of those are just increases in ground leases and other standard increases in our other operating cost. We also have a decline in our services margin. As we indicated in our guidance to services revenue, we're showing a decline year-over-year. And a lot of that is basically due to a stoppage or a slowdown in work that we're expecting from Sprint versus what we saw this year in the services business. But the margin that's generated through that business is also down, obviously, as a result of the volume being down, so that negatively impacts it as well. And then just generic overhead standard cost-of-living type increases there. So I think when you figure all those things in, unfortunately, a number of those put a weight on our year-over-year AFFO growth. But those are really the only issues. And when you strip all that away, and a lot of it is noise, in that it's temporal. And you look at the core organic growth rates, we do expect them to be better next year actually than this year and fairly consistent with where we were a couple of years ago before sort of our peak leasing activities.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just on that kind of core performance point, I think in the script, I think you and Jeff both referenced something about how a year ago you thought the growth would be better than it turned out to be and that's a part of the story, but I've only kind of seen guidance seem to ratchet upward, net of currency. So, I'm trying to understand those comments.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Last year, when we first talked about what our guidance implied from an organic growth rate standpoint, we thought that we would be somewhere around 8% net for 2015. As indicated in the press release and our comments today, we now expect that number will be closer to 7% net, down about 1%. And again, that measured fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter 2014. That's what we were projecting last year, similar to what we're doing this year. And when we look ahead to where we will be in the fourth quarter, we expect that it will be lower. And a lot of that is driven by the timing of when we expected to see organic growth. I think if you'll recall early in the year, we talked about an expectation that we would see a ratcheting up as we got into the second half of the year of 2015. We really haven't seen that. And so, as we get here to the back half of the year and we measure our same tower growth by looking back essentially on activity that's taken place over the trailing 12 months, we recognized that by the end of the year, our run rate will be less coming out of this year than we anticipated when we gave guidance a year ago. And so, that impact of the second half of the year of 2015 being slower affects the full-year to full-year guidance comparison from 2015 to 2016, I think a little bit lower than what would have been expected previously.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Okay. Thanks...
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I would – David, this is Jeff. I would just add, when you look at the guidance and you try and do year-over-year comparisons, what makes up 2016 results is activity that occurs between September of 2015 and the end of August of 2016, because after that, activity doesn't really turn into a financial result. That's just the lag that's always been in the industry. So I think the point about expecting 9% to 10% this time last year, and as you see, we're trending now down towards 8% and that has been moving down as we moved through the year. It basically shows that we're a little bit behind on the business that we expected this year and the fourth quarter over fourth quarter is very important for the run rate that enters next year. And that's really, besides all the specifics that we've already talked about, that's the reason. We're seeing less U.S. domestic business in the second half of the year than we thought we would a year ago.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And do you attribute that to forces at work that will – that mean that that revenue is never coming, Jeff, or is it coming in 2016, but we've just kind of stutter stepped a little bit, and in 2016-2017, we're back to normal?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, absolutely. I think we all know that there have been some of our customers this year who have had huge cash needs away from their typical network investment. And I'll tell you, the biggest source of confidence to me as – a year ago, we were coming off this huge 2014 year and we saw application – a year ago, we saw applications declining and we reflected that in our 9% to 10% growth, which was obviously less than what we'd done previously. Today, applications are growing. So I view that as a very important sign that what we saw this year with a particular customer or two, is temporal and that the 20-year history of investing for network goes on.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Perfect. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: A couple follow-up questions. As David pointed out, the augmentation amortization is non-cash, but it does flow into AFFO, given the way you're amortizing it. It looks like last year, third quarter, fourth quarter 2014, it definitely ramped up augmentation CapEx to like $20 million, $30 million. Now it seems like we're heading back down to maybe $10 million a quarter level. Is that what we should be expecting? Is that augmentation capital, which you get reimbursed for partly, is heading more towards a $40 million run rate versus what had peaked at about $80 million? Is that kind of what you're suggesting to us?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I think you're a little high on what it peaked at. It wasn't quite that high. It was probably more like $70 million was the peak. But that's correct, we have it going down. But I will say that one of the things that is a potential upside here is that as leasing activity increases, which we expect it to do, this kind of tracks with that, because the more activity you have, the more carriers touching towers, the more towers that are touched, the more likely that you will have these augmentations for which we'll receive these reimbursements. And so, that number we would expect will settle out and perhaps be higher by the time we get to 2017. But it's really kind of peaked out this year because it's trailing the high activity levels we had in 2014.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, that's a part of our business, Ric, that will go on. But in terms of the variability and the magnitude of the year-over-year, we don't expect to see that again.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And one thing, maybe I'll clarify one point. You mentioned it being non-cash. It's non-cash in terms of the timing. But it is cash revenue. We're actually receiving that money and then amortizing it in.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Yeah, I mean, you get the cash all upfront and then you just amortize it over the remaining life of the lease of the amendment term?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. Correct.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Correct.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then second question is, I think in the press release last night you talked about the 4Q over 4Q growth being 9% gross, 7.5% net. And then you mentioned this morning domestic and non-international at 11% for gross. Is there some decimal points going there? Because...
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: ...maybe...
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: ...domestic more like – yeah.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's basically – I mean where you're getting at is basically right. The domestic is slightly less than 9%. The consolidated is a hair more than 9%, but domestic is such a large percentage, when you round the number it's basically 9% for both, because obviously it is pulled up by the international.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Remember our domestic business now is about 87%-ish of the total.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sure. And because the other piece of the question is on the international, 11% gross constant currency growth rate. What are your escalators? What have you seen as far as what level of escalators you're receiving? When do the escalators kick in? Is it annually? Is it based on the life of the purchase of the asset? Because we've been seeing some of the CPIs and Brazil indicators suggesting mid and now high single-digits just on CPI?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. Yeah and obviously, all the stuff that we have in Central America and Canada are fixed escalators, and those average 3%-ish – 3%, 3.5%. So, those are similar to what we have in the U.S. When you go to Brazil, as you know, it's based on inflationary indexes. They do happen annually, based on the annual anniversary date of the lease. Most of those do come in lumps because of the timing of when we acquired the big portfolios that we acquired. So we have a decent amount that happens at the end of the year and a decent amount more towards April. Those are the bigger dates. We have definitely seen it come up because of inflation during this year. The average impact for 2015 though was about 7%, versus a total organic growth rate in Brazil of about 13%. So we had about 6% outside of escalators. Next year, that number will probably be similar to maybe slightly higher, but there is an expectation that inflation rates decline in Brazil throughout the next 12 months. So it's really going to be a matter of timing.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Maybe a little slowing on the non-escalator growth in Brazil as you go through the macroeconomic, the political, the regulatory, the potential M&A. But then, thinking longer term, it comes back up to a better organic versus escalator-driven?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: For that exact reason, we basically took 100 basis points off of what we did this year.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, that's exactly right.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: All right. Thank you. Our next question in queue, that will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and good morning, folks.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: In thinking about sort of your outlook for 2016, and I know you've walked through some of the bridge with respect to the AFFO, but if I think about sort of the top line outlook here, it seems as though the expectation is building in improving activity with respect to your domestic business. I know, Jeff, that you had mentioned that you're feeling a little bit more confident when it comes to the leasing activity that you're seeing in the marketplace, particularly with respect to certain customers that have perhaps been a bit of a drag in 2015. I guess where we sit today, given that confidence, I mean, what potential levers do you have for additional upside to that outlook? I'm just trying to get a sense that typically, what we've seen in the past with you folks is a bit more of a conservative stance when looking to 2016. At this juncture, you folks are giving an outlook that implies a bit more pickup in activity going into next year. And I'm just trying to understand sort of where the potential opportunities are for you as we progress through 2016 when looking at that sort of top line growth outlook.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me answer the question this way, Amir. Pick a particular carrier that we know has done a tremendous amount of work several years ago. And if you put a number of 100 on that level of activity, 2015 is going to turn out to be something like 20. It's been that far of a difference between the peak. So our estimates for next year are higher, but they're not certainly anywhere close to where we were in the peak years. So, I would, first and foremost, say if we get more activity out of that particular customer, as we've seen in years past, that could be a tremendous pickup. If we see anything out of Sprint, that will be a pickup. If we do more M&A or we do more stock repurchases, now that won't help the AFFO or the top line, but stock repurchases clearly do help the AFFO per share line. So I think we have a tremendous number of levers to play. I can assure you we're committed to pull them all as appropriate because it's our goal, of course, to move through next year and get back to our tradition of beating and raising every quarter.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then if I may, on a follow-up to David's prior question, in terms of the activity and the timing of activity. It does seem as though the activity that you've experienced in the back half of 2015 which is really sort of a precursor for the 2016 outlook was a bit softer than expected. As we progress through the course of 2016, how should we think about the pace of activity from a seasonal perspective or from a trajectory perspective through the course of the year? If we start to see an improvement in activity in the first half of the year does that translate really into how we should think about things for the back half of 2016? I'm just trying to assess how we should see the pace of activity sort of translate through the course of the year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think it'll come through anecdotal discussions about levels of activity applications. But watch the organic growth rate every quarter. When that moves up, then I think you will see that that is a very good indicator that things are progressing towards the 2016 that we've laid out.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And from the activity levels that you're seeing or at least some of the discussions you're seeing, do you expect that organic growth rate to sort of steadily pick up through the course of the year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think it builds from the levels that we're at now, which are around 8%, and it's going to – by the time we're a year from now, we're expecting that it will be at the 9% that we talked about.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you so much for taking the questions.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I may. First, just in terms of understanding the organic growth numbers and I guess the – we have a lot of different numbers to look at here. But when I look at the $117 million of incremental leasing that you're expecting next year, and I back out the $25 million that's associated with the new builds and the acquisition, I get $92 million. And I put that against the cash leasing number. For this year, I'm coming out with a net leasing of 6.4%. Is the difference between that 6.4% and the 7.5% that you guys are talking to, the reference to sort of the fourth quarter over the fourth quarter, is that the difference?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's two things. That's one difference is the timing because you're looking at mid-year, full-year to mid-year, full-year last year, as opposed to Q4 to Q4, and we do expect it to be higher. But the other difference is that we're calculating that percentage as a percentage of revenue that excludes a few things that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, specifically pass-through expenses that are included in revenue, the augmentation amortization stuff. So, we take that out of the denominator, if you will. And those items represent about 10% at least in 2015, probably a little bit less as we get into next year. But about 10% of our cash leasing revenue for 2015 was made up by that. So, if you took that cash leasing revenue number of $14.29 million (46:21) and you back out about 10% of that and you went to roughly 90% of it, then I think the $92 million, divided by that, would get you closer to a little over 7%, which is still lower than the 7.5%, but that's because you're measuring in the middle of the year. By the time you get to the end of the year, that number would be 7.5%.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Okay. That's actually super helpful. And then my second question is just again, going through the guidance, the EBITDA guidance, for example, for next year, $30 million up on a reported basis. So, on average, $3 million increase a quarter. And, I guess, I'm having a hard time connecting the dots between what we're talking about from an organic site leasing number and then having that translate into such a minor increment on the reported numbers.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. So, when it comes to EBITDA, you've got the revenue that we just talked about. And basically the cash revenue items, sum up to about $83 million, that's the $117 million less the augmentation reimbursements and iDen churn, gets you about $83 million of positive impact there. We are losing $14 million on EBITDA from FX impacts. And then there are increases in cost, the direct cost of leasing are up approximately $20 million on a non-FX basis. And our SG&A is up roughly $5 million on a non-FX basis. So, when you add those items in and then you also take into account the fact that there's a decline in the services margin, you'll come up at the change in the ranges that we've indicated in our guidance.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Okay. Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. I guess the first question is you've historically been fairly conservative on the out-year guide. And given the miss in 2015 and what looks like rebounding activity levels now, can we assume you gave yourself a little bit more room as you looked at 2016 guidance?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've put out a conservative view, Phil, that we think gives us a lot of options.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then second, you mentioned Sprint on taking – was less service revenue this year. Is Sprint just doing less activity? I wouldn't have expected they did a lot of activity this year either. Or are they sort of doing the same level of activity and doing it in-house instead? Thanks.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, they have not done much at all on the leasing side. On the services side, we did have work – a lot of that actually had to do with the decommissioning of the iDen network, so as that has largely wrapped up, that's part of the decline. But yeah, they're not doing much in terms of new build-outs.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And I want to say, Phil, this is – these comments are limited to their business with us.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I can't – we can't really speak to the overall entity and what they're doing.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That helps. And finally, if I can, Jeff, over the last few months, you've talked about your excitement in giving the 2016 guide. I think people are having a hard time seeing what's exciting here. Can you just sort of reiterate what you find exciting about 2016, whether that's new leasing activity or anything else going on in the business? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think what we have here is a very stable and consistent business that right now, on the 2016 guide, reflects in large part less U.S. domestic activity in the second half of 2015, all for reasons that I don't believe are, in any way, permanent or even long-lived. And I think we've got a lot of capital and opportunity to continue to invest and grow the business. I think the interest rate environment is going to continue to be very positive for SBA. And I think we're going to have a lot of opportunities to excel and exceed the things that we're talking about today.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue, that will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. I wonder if you could just go back on Brazil and clarify the escalators. I may have missed it but is it entirely CPI-based or how much of your business there stays on fixed escalators? And then I was also interested in just the drivers that you see next year. You talked a little bit about the U.S. and what underlies your 2016 outlook. You mentioned the existing business you're seeing in Brazil. Is your 2016 outlook predicated on kind of a similar mix of business amongst those two carriers or do you see any shift going on? And then finally, the acquisitions that you talked about post the end of the quarter, Ecuador is a chunk of it, but can you talk about the balance of the asset purchases and how they are broken out domestically versus internationally and would that be all 4Q or 1Q in terms of when those close? Thanks.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay So, on the Brazil escalators, they're all CPI-based, although on the leasebacks that we got in the Oi acquisitions that we did, there are minimum floors of 6.5% to the extent that the inflationary index would fall below that. But otherwise, all of the tenant leases escalate on a CPI basis. I'm sorry, the second one I forget. Was the makeup of the...
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. On Brazil, Jonathan, we have – because we bought a lot of our towers from Oi, we've seen and we expect to continue to see most of our new incremental activity from Telefónica, TIM and América Móvil. So, that's – it's really a continuation of that sources of business that we've seen this year.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then the last one was on M&A. The Ecuador assets were actually closed in the third quarter. They closed – and were in our total numbers of sites that we bought during the quarter. As far as the stuff that's under contract, we're assuming that that's all closed by the end of the first quarter of 2016. There are some that we're thinking may close right at the end of the year. So, no real contributions to 2015 guidance, but obviously we expect them to contribute almost entirely to 2016.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And what's the geographic mix of those?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Most are domestic.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Just a question on the balance sheet. Aside from the level of rates and cost of capital, what other considerations are being given to your leverage ratios? I guess specifically, with respect to the buyback, for example, if domestic acquisition opportunities were to remain somewhat limited and presumably, drive a deceleration in the level of EBITDA growth, would you still be comfortable maintaining the leverage target while sort of deploying that $1 billion or so of excess capital into the buyback?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think if all we were doing was buybacks, we would look to bring that leverage ratio down a little bit. Our single largest item though that we follow on that is our U.S. cash interest coverage to our debt because it's all denominated in U.S. dollars. That's well north of three times. So, that really is – I view as the single most important lever and item to be watching. But to your first point, if all we were doing is stock repurchases, and I don't think that would be the case, we probably would look to operate at lower leverage.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then if I could just get a little more color on kind of the assumptions behind the organic – the 11.5% organic growth internationally, if you could – you gave a little bit of color around the escalators next year, but I'd like to just get a better sense of kind of the magnitude and the timing, sort of the cadence of when we should expect the – particularly the Brazil escalations to kick in and sort of drive higher year-over-year growth rates over the course of – kind of over the quarters of next year.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, a lot of the escalators take place either in the fourth quarter or the second quarter of the year in Brazil. So, depending on where the inflationary rates are at those points in time, that impacts what the average rates are. But as Jeff mentioned earlier, we basically lowered our organic growth assumptions in Brazil by about 100 basis points compared to what we saw this year. So, instead of 13% same-tower growth, we're assuming 12% at relatively similar escalation rates which this year were just around 7%. So, that's that. I mean, the timing in terms of the lease-up, it's assumed to happen evenly throughout the year, but the escalators will be a little more lumpy.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The cadence on international is more evenly weighted, while the U.S. is building throughout the year.
Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue, that will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Jeff, I wonder if you could just expand on your comments on the M&A market. I think you said there were a variety of things you weren't really enthusiastic about in some of the properties you've seen. Have you – are you seeing there's still a good volume of opportunities? Do you think are deals to be done there in size so that you go up to that, closer to 10% or even above in the coming year? You also touched on – or maybe Brendan in his remarks – on FirstNet. Is that going to be anything that you can start to think about as you exit 2016 into 2017? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It may be something to think about as we exit 2016. I'm encouraged by the organizational steps that are being taken, the RFP processes that are being initiated. That's all much progress compared to one and two years ago there. On the M&A side, Simon, there's actually an awful lot out there we could be looking at, particularly domestically. And when I say awful lot, I mean a lot of transactions in the $25 million, $50 million, up to several hundred million range. We've pursued and secured some of those. We've passed on even more. And it's really a question of price, and it comes down to kind of a very simple approach. If we can buy back our own stock versus an asset that is essentially similar to our domestic portfolio and looks like it will lease up the same, but we could buy it six turns plus cheaper on a tower cash flow level, we think more value will be created that way. But having said that, as we said earlier in our prepared remarks, for the right deals, we think portfolio growth is a very good way, and one that we've demonstrated over the years has created a lot of shareholder value. So we're constantly looking.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And are those deals getting done somewhere else or are they just not trading?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, they're getting done somewhere else.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Just a point of clarification. I just wanted to make sure, did you say you do anticipate growing the portfolio at that typical 5% to 10% range in 2016? And then my other question, Sprint, obviously, on its most recent call called out $1 billion to $1.2 billion in transformational or transformative costs, I guess, to get to their cost synergies ultimately. One would assume with such a large number that there could be some lease cancellations, not necessarily from towers but from other parts of their business as well. Are you concerned at all that there could be another drop down, I guess, in terms of towers that they might want to churn beyond those that they had already called out for iDen? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. You heard the answer on the 5% to 10%, right, which is yes we do expect that for next year. On the Sprint issue, the bigger concern is the level of incremental activity that we can expect in the near term. Given the structure of the leases that we have, Colby, and the mission-critical nature of all the sites that remain post iDen churn, I really don't worry a lot about the specifics of your question and further terminations.
Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. Actually, just to go to a small data point you put in the release, you said you took an impairment charge on fiber-related to Mobilitie. So, I was hoping you maybe could explain that a little bit. Did you sell it or did you take it out of service? And then just extending on the fiber topic, can we revisit why you decided to monetize your investment in ExteNet as opposed to maybe making a much more sizeable investment in the small cell business?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The fiber write-off was occasioned by a customer informing us that they intended to exit the system. We're in discussions around that now. We have not yet found another user for that fiber, Brett. It's still on our books, we still own it. But that's why we took the write-down. And in terms of the ExteNet question is, really hasn't changed at all. Small cells is a very interesting business that we're actually taking steps to develop internally with a focus on our own assets and a more indoor and managed rooftop approach. And we just thought that the money that it would have taken to acquire ExteNet, not only immediately, but the amount that would have been necessary to put into it over the next couple of years, we are better served, and our shareholders are better served, by directing that elsewhere. But I think you should – and it's not going to be material early and it's not going to happen overnight. But we're definitely going to be pursuing things in that area.
Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just because you did have that experience seeing ExteNet's business, what is it about the rooftop and the indoor business that you find appealing relative to what they were doing outdoors?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think when you overlay that question on our assets, I think there's an element of exclusivity there that makes it in our view more like towers.
Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, that will come from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Thanks. I just wanted to go back to, I guess, a couple of your comments on share repurchase. I think during the call, you talked about the intrinsic value being low and then, I think a couple of questions ago you talked about it relative to capital investments. So given the stock is even lower than what you purchased it at, and unless these sale prices are coming down, shouldn't we just expect you to continue to buy the stock until it kind of recovers here?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think there's a good opportunity for more stock repurchases in our future. And that's probably all I should say to that topic.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Okay. And then I get that buying assets might be more expensive than your own stock. But then there's the other kind of flipside of that is that we can all, as investors, buy your stock. But we can't get the same value out of the assets that you buy in the markets. Can you help us rationalize that kind of thought process? Because even though it might be more expensive, it's something that's still additive to the growth of your business even though the valuation may be higher, which we just don't have access to as investors.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, you're right, and I think that's a very astute comment. And that's why our balance this year was like 60%/40% or maybe – no, it's actually...
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Two-thirds.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...two-thirds, 66% towards new asset and portfolio growth, and one-third stock repurchases.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Got it. And then just one on the operational front. Some of the issue as far as how the revenue is going to ramp and accelerate over the course of the year is based on, I think you said that AT&T's activity or lack thereof in 2015 and how it kind of carries through into 2016, I mean, just the timeline of activity versus when revenue hits. So when we're thinking about Sprint – and obviously, you guys have been very clear about not expecting much out of Sprint – can you help us understand like when do you actually see activity? Because I would have thought that if Sprint has been signed off on a plan and the only issue in moving forward is getting financing for that plan, that they would have had preliminary discussions with you guys about their activity. In other words, they've communicated to people that within a few weeks, they will put in place these leasing – infrastructure leasing and handset leasing things. And if it's just a matter of money in a few weeks, I would have thought that they would have given you clear indications of their activity in the upcoming quarters. So are you indicating that that hasn't even occurred? And then also, just give us a sense of when those discussions first start happening with an operator, how quickly do the cell sites themselves get activated, and you start collecting revenue on those sites? Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, there's definitely, Walter, a lag of three months to six months from the time they really get started. You have to go and you have to re – basically permit and re-audit the site, make sure whatever they want to do there can be done. I mean, I would just say that we haven't had a degree of interaction yet that would give us the confidence to put something in our 2016 guidance and leave it at that.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: I just find it hard to reconcile for a company that's claiming that they're going to be – have this very strong network by the end of 2016. It takes six months for that to happen, that nothing – it's November and that nothing's occurred yet. There just seems to be a massive disconnect in the market. And as you may know, Crown Castle said that one of the operators told them that they couldn't comment on this. I just – is there anything you can help us to understand exactly what is going on there?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I think those questions are best directed to our customers.
Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC: Great. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, we have time for one more question. 10610
Operator: Thank you, sir. That will come from Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just – actually, two questions, sorry. The first is just to clarify in your guidance, that $117 million, is that net of just normal churn? It seems that actually normal churn picked up about – to 1.4%. So, on an apples-to-apple basis, we should be adding that back to full-year organic growth guidance. And then, I was sort of a little bit higher than 8%, sort of 8.5% for the full year 2016 over full year 2015, if you're looking at just gross before all churn...?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Gross is 9%, Spencer, 9%. If you're looking at Q4 2016 to Q4 2015, we're assuming 9% gross, 7.5% net. And yes, on a full-year to full-year, that $117 million does include the net impact of churn.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Got it. And that, we should assume that's around 1%?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'd say a little bit more than 1%, yeah.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Got it. Thanks. And then secondly, one thing that I've been struggling with is, it seems that you've talked about the first quarter of 2015 as being the lowest quarter of revenue from one particular carrier. And things have picked up since then. But first quarter domestic growth was almost – it was 10.8% almost, before all churn. And it seems like that's dropping to 8% for most of next year. And how do we reconcile that difference? We'd expected that if the first quarter 2015 was the weakest quarter, then growth should be an easy comp in the first quarter of 2016?
Brendan Thomas Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Those calculations are done doing it compared to the prior year, same quarter. So, you're basically picking up the activity over the previous 12 months. So, the rate that was talked about in the first quarter had very little to do with the activity levels during the first quarter. We now carry that quarter with us and have for the last couple of quarters, that's why you've seen a decline in the reported same tower growth rate each quarter during this year. And we expect it to be similarly low next quarter. And this year as a whole, while the first quarter was the lowest, this year as a whole, the leasing has been down relative to last year. So, we will carry that with us as we move into next year as well. And until we get to the end of the year, which is why we give Q4 to Q4 guidance, only at that time will you really be reflective of activity that takes place during the full-year 2016 which again we'd expect to be higher than 2015.
Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks very much.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to our presenters for any closing comments.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And we look forward to our next report with our final 2015 results. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Communications Corp Second Quarter Results Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions-and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the conference over to Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead sir.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; as well as Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we are going to discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2015 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results, may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, July 30, 2015, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. The comments we will make today will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined by Regulation G and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted to our website, sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Brendan to comment on our second quarter results.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another very strong quarter in all areas. We were above the midpoint of our guidance for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO. GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $370.5 million or an 8.8% increase over the second quarter of 2014. Domestic cash site leasing revenue increased 8.5% to 300.2 million and international cash site leasing revenue increased 17.3% to $57 million.  Eliminating the impact of changes in the foreign currency exchange rate, total site leasing revenue would have increased 13.9% over the year earlier period and international cash site leasing revenue would have increased 49%. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth including our fourth quarter acquisition from Oi in Brazil.  We continued to experience solid leasing demand both domestically and internationally. Approximately two thirds of our incremental leasing activity in the quarter came from new leases. The big four U.S. carriers contributed approximately 70% of our consolidated incremental leasing revenue signed up in the quarter.  Tower cash flow for the second quarter of 2015 was $284 million or a 9.7% increase over the year earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rate, tower cash flow would have increased 13.4% over the second quarter of 2014. Tower cash flow margin was 79.5% compared to 79.6% in the year earlier period.  Our services revenues were $40.2 million compared to $43 million in the year earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $9.9 million in the second quarter compared to $10.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. Services segment operating profit margin was 24.5% compared to 25.4% in the year earlier period.  SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $28.3 million including non-cash compensation charges of 8.1 million. SG&A expenses were $25.4 million in the year earlier period including non-cash compensation charges of 6.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $274.3 million or an increase of 9.2% over the year earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rate, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 12.9% over the year earlier period.  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 69% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 68.2% in the year earlier period. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 8.2% to $184.5 million compared to $170.6 million in the second quarter of 2014. AFFO per share increased 8.4% to a $1.42 compared to a $1.31 in the second quarter of 2014. Combined changes in the Brazilian and Canadian exchange rate during the second quarter versus the rate assumed in our guidance negatively impacted leasing revenue by $265,000 in both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by approximately $150,000.  iDEN related churn during the quarter had a negative impact of $950,000. Net income during the second quarter was $28.3 million compared to net loss of 9.5 million in the year earlier period. Net income for the second quarter of 2015 included a $15.7 million gain on the currency related re-measurement of a U.S. dollar denominated intercompany loan with our Brazilian subsidiary.  Net income per share for the second quarter of 2015 was $0.22 compared to net loss per share of $0.07 in the year earlier period. Quarter end shares outstanding were 128.2 million. In the second quarter we acquired 317 communication sites and other assets for $220.1 million in cash. SBA also built 117 sites during the second quarter. We ended the quarter with 24,808 sites, 15467 of these sites are in the U.S. and its territories and 9341 are in international markets.  Total cash capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2015 were $320.1 million consisting of 8.5 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CAPEX and 311.6 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CAPEX for the second quarter includes 220.1 million incurred in connection with acquisition excluding working capital adjustments. Discretionary cash CAPEX also included 24.1 million in new tower construction including construction in progress and $15 million for gross augmentations in tower upgrades. The substantial majority of augmentation CAPEX is reimbursed to us by our customers.  During the quarter we spent an aggregate of $54.9 million to buy land easement and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 73% of our towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control is approximately 33 years. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the second quarter with $8.3 billion of total debt. We had cash, cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash, and short-term investments of $117.6 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.4 times. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.5 times. During the quarter we borrowed an incremental $500 million under our existing credit agreement in the form of a seven year term loan B. The loan was issued at 99% of par value and will include interest at LIBOR plus 250 basis points for the 75 basis point LIBOR floor. Proceeds from this financing were used to repay $490 million of the outstanding balance under our revolver.  Currently we have a $170 million outstanding under our $1 billion revolver. At the end of the quarter our total debt carried a weighted average coupon of 3.9% and a weighted average maturity at just over 5 years. During the quarter we repurchased the remaining $150 million of common stock authorized under our $300 million repurchase plan. This consisted of the repurchase of over 1.3 million shares at an average price of $114 or $0.96 per share.  On June 4, we announced the authorization of a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter we repurchased approximately 800,000 shares of stock for $91.1 million at an average price per share of $115.50 and currently have $908 million of repurchased authorization remaining under our current program. I’ll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. As you’ve heard we had another solid quarter exceeding the midpoint of our guidance across all key financial metrics. Organic leasing activity, strong expense control, and some contribution from acquisitions were once again the primary reasons for our performance. We continue to see solid demand across our entire portfolio both domestic and international as well as in our services segment. We expect continued solid levels of activity for years to come as carrier seek additional network capacity as use of wireless data marches ever higher and as new spectrum gets deployed.  Ahead of us is the deployment of AWS-3, WCS 600 MHz FirstNet [ph] and Dish spectrum all of those deployments we believe will require some additional infrastructure. The need for and the catalyst behind additional network investment continue on and we see no end in sight. These dynamics are at play in all of our markets both domestically and internationally.  In the second quarter we posted solid leasing results across our entire portfolio domestic and particularly international. Same tower cash leasing revenue growth compared to the year ago prior period was 9.5% on a gross constant currency basis and 6.5% on a net of churn basis including iDEN related churn. Our same tower calculation as always is reflective of organic growth and recurring cash leasing revenue over the last four quarters, in this case ending June 30th and not including the second quarter of 2014, which was the highest leasing quarter in our history.  Our same tower calculation includes no new tower builds or acquisitions and since our augmentation costs are almost entirely reimbursed, this growth comes at virtually no capital expenditure cost. Our domestic same tower growth rate was also 9.5% on a gross basis and was 6.0% on a net basis while our international organic growth rate was 11.5% both gross and net on a currency neutral basis. Brazil grew at an organic rate of 12.5%.  We attribute our leasing success to a combination of quality assets, strong execution, good contracts, and excellent demand from our customers. In the second quarter in the U.S. the leasing demand environment improved over levels we experienced in the prior two quarters and was consistent with our expectations when we issued our 2015 outlook in November. Our incremental revenue added per tower in the U.S. this quarter was at the exact same rate as the second quarter of 2013 coincidentally.  In total we executed high numbers of both new tenant leases and amendments. Revenue from new leases was greater than that from amendment and represented approximately 60% of incremental leasing revenue in the U.S. Horizon and T-Mobile represented the majority of our new business in the quarter. AT&T was more active in the second quarter compared to the first quarter but still at greatly reduced levels compared to the first three quarters of 2014.  Contributions from Sprint with both new leases and amendments that paced similar to prior quarters and where we believe in advance of formerly launching its next generation network brands which are still ahead. Our backlogs continue to be healthy. We continue to expect that leasing levels will increase in the second half of the year over first half levels which depending on timing may or may not impact 2015 financial results. At a minimum we expect to end the year with a strong leasing run rate which will bode well for 2016 when we will have also gotten past substantially all of our I determination.  We saw a strong activity in our international market adding our most incremental revenue in a quarter ever on a constant currency basis. International growth rates picked up nicely from the first quarter. As expected new leases represented the majority of the activity contributing approximately 80% of the total incremental international leasing revenue added in the quarter.  International cash leasing revenue and tower cash flow growth grew materially year-over-year once again primarily due to portfolio growth. International tower cash flow margins were strong at 70% and are expected to grow now that we have had a couple of quarters to integrate our Brazilian acquisitions. GAAP requires us to markup our revenue and expenses by the amount of the ground lease expenses reimbursed to us by our customers so the true economic cash flow margins in Brazil are much higher. I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in Brazil while the macro environment in Brazil continues to be challenging and to some degree we believe limiting carrier investment. We had our best order yet in terms of leasing revenue added. We remained convinced that Brazil will be an excellent long-term investment. The demographic trends, Smartphone sales, network needs, new spectrum in the competitive carrier dynamic all lead us to continue to believe that Brazil will be a growth market for a network investment for many years to come.  We are making great progress in proving and integrating the towers we most recently acquired in Brazil and positioning ourselves to capture all the benefits of future improved economic conditions and increased carrier spending. Our services segment produced another strong quarter of results for us in the second quarter and we expect this steady services segment contribution through all of 2015. Our operational performance across the entire company was once again very strong in the second quarter. We posted industry leading tower cash flow margins of almost 80% companywide and over 81% in the U.S. Strong tower cash flow and services margins as well as low cash SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue drove our adjusted EBITDA margin to another record at 69%.  We are generating phenomenal operating leverage in our business, even as we continue to invest in additional international back office and other capabilities. We believe our industry leading tower cash flow and EBITDA margins are due to our focus on and experience with macro tower site and the expense efficiencies attainable through the gross margin and SG&A lines in that business.  The strong adjusted EBITDA results we had of the second quarter drove our equally strong AFO and AFFO per share results. Our updated 2015 outlook reflects our expectations of solid carrier activity, organic growth rates and services for the remainder of the year. On a constant currency basis the current outlook represents approximately a 1% increase to the mid points from our initial outlook for leasing revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO. Unfavorable changes in the Brazilian Reais to U.S. dollar exchange rate are expected however to more than offset those increases. We believe carrier activity will continue to increase as we move through the second half which will position us well for 2016.  Our current 2015 outlook contemplates approximately 9% gross same tower cash revenue growth on a constant currency basis before iDEN churn. We have included no material contribution in 2015 from Dish, public safety, AWS-3, or Sprint’s next generation network plant.  Our balance sheet remains in great shape and additional capital if needed remains readily available. We intend to continue our balance sheet strategy and maintain our existing leverage targets as we believe them to contribute materially to shareholder value creation. Our capital allocation focus is portfolio growth that meets are underwriting and investment return requirements on share repurchases at prices that we believe are below intrinsic value. If neither of those conditions are met, we don’t allocate capital.  Capital allocation for us is a dynamic and opportunistic process. We had a good second quarter acquiring 317 additional sites almost all of which were in the U.S. We have a healthy amount of towers under contract to purchase mostly international. Our new tower build activities were also very solid in the second quarter both domestically and internationally. Portfolio growth remains our top priority but again only for qualified opportunities with the right price terms and business characteristics.  So far this year our investment capacity has exceeded the amount of those qualified portfolio growth opportunities so we have repurchased a significant amount of our stock at prices we believe are well below intrinsic value. With respect to portfolio growth, our primary focus remains in the western hemisphere. If we are successful in consummating some additional acquisitions, depending on the timing of such acquisitions our 2015 outlook could increase.  Last week ExteNet announced a restructuring where its current investors including SBA will exit and a new investment group will come in. Restructuring contemplates both initial and future earn out payment and when it is all said and done we expect to return of more than two times our initial investment of 43 million which we believe will equate to an approximately 13% to 15% internal rate of return. We have been investors in ExteNet for over 5 years and had a front row seat to watch the development of the dash and small cell business.  We respect the management team there greatly and wish them the best. We learned a lot. Through the experience we have concluded that we prefer the macro site tower business given our history, experience, and the business models proven success, operational leverage, and financial advantages. We chose to exit ExteNet rather than increase our investment as we believe we have better uses of capital that will produce superior long-term growth in AFFO per share.  In no way do we believe our macro site tower business will be negatively impacted by small cells in general or specifically by our decision not to increase our investment in small cells. We will continue to allocate resources to non macro site technology with the primary focus on accommodating non macro site technology on the over 30,000 sites we own or manage around the globe where we have capital efficiency exclusivity, contract advantages, and a traditional real estate structure.  Before we open it up for questions, I want to thank our employees for their hard work in the second quarter and our customers for continuing to entrust us with their business. We look forward to continued success as we move through 2015. And operator at this time we are ready for questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead please. 
David Barden: Hey guys, thanks a lot for taking the questions. Jeff maybe a couple for you, just first following up on the ExteNet decision, I think it was about six months ago when you kind of were asked if you had to come down on one side or the other of the decision between the kind of Crown Castle or small cell site focus for incremental investment or the American Tower International you actually said you are leaning on the Crown Castle side of things which I think put a lot of focus on SBA’s intentions in the small cell site business. Could you kind of tell us a little bit more about what you learned over the course of that exercise to kind of let you to decide that the doubling of your investment was enough to kind of buy you out of that strategy? And then I guess the second part would be just on kind of the impact on the outlook with respect to Brazil and the currency movements there kind of highlight the risks of investing certainly in individual international markets, what’s going on in Brazil increasing your desire to diversify away from Brazil, is it increasing your desire to focus more on the U.S. or is it really having no effect on kind of your capital allocation decisions that will be super helpful, thanks? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Let me first say David, I don’t really recall saying that we favored a Crown approach over to American Tower approach. I think what I recall saying was that I saw an increased level of activity in the small cell business and that was a positive change from years ago but that we were still evaluating our interest in the business from a capital efficiency and impact on AFFO per share generation. So, we really haven’t changed any views over the last six months but over the last five years we have taken it all in and concluded that to substantially increase our SG&A overhead expense, to vigorously compete for what we believe is the lower margin capital intensive loan cycle business, which is currently and we think is going up to stay relatively small percentage of our customer spending is inconsistent with our long term views of increasing tower cash flow margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, AFFO margin, and ultimately maximizing AFFO per share. It was really a financial decision as most things we do are and again it’s all about our quest to constantly maximize AFFO per share.  And in terms of your international question, I think you have to be cognizant of what’s going in the Brazil with the Reais. Again we are in these markets to maximize AFFO per share. Over the last year of Brazil has not particularly contributed in that endeavor. We do believe that it will overtime do very well, but you have to take into consideration currency issues and what that means and whether that’s a short term dynamic, a long term dynamic. So we would have an interest in definitely continuing to diversify those income streams and currency risk as we continue to move forward. 
David Barden: Great, thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Go ahead please.
Richard Prentiss: Thanks, good morning guys. First question I’ve got for you, if you think about your 2015 guidance change, can you kind of breakout for us how much of the change in guidance was due to external acquisitions, how much of the guidance change was from increased business in your legacy assets. I think I heard maybe 1% constant currency FX, how much was FX effect and then also talk a little bit about the change in interest cost which is kind of the bridge if you look in the last guidance to this guidance, how much was external driven, how much was internal business doing better, how much was FX, and how much was the interest cost?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Hey Ric, just to clarify you mentioned the 1%. The 1% is in reference to the changes that took place from the time that we initially gave our guidance in November of last year. Going back to what we guided to just a quarter ago for the full year 2015 and the changes in the new guidance that we just put out yesterday. Basically on the revenue line the entire change is just due to the FX shift. We lowered our the midpoint of our full year leasing revenue guidance by $9 million, the impact of the FX changes and our assumptions versus what we assumed last time was $9 million. So basically that’s the whole change and really that’s driven by the fact that while we did add a little bit of M&A, its frankly in consequential. We’ve increased our discretionary CAPEX by about $40 million for the year. A lot of that will be staggered over the last part of the year and we’ll have very little impact on the P&L.  So our views on the organic leasing opportunities really are basically the same as what we had before. We’ve as Jeff mentioned earlier in his remarks we expect to see pickup in the second half in terms of activity levels, that’s what we expected before. So there really has been no change. So basically we are looking at the same expectations we had previously. And as you kind of go down the other categories, we have slight pickups in tower cash flow and EBITDA driven. By expense control a little bit out performance and services that we had in the second quarter so, that’s basically what’s flowing through to those items. 
Richard Prentiss: And the interest expense change?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: And yes we’ve increased our interest expense which is basically due to two things; one, in our last guidance we did not include any expectations for stock repurchases. As you are aware we repurchased to date since that time about $240 million of stock buybacks. So that’s all basically paid for through incremental debt. It also takes into account the term loan that we did which was essentially terming out some of our revolver borrowings. While that gives us greater liquidity it does come at a slightly higher interest rate than the revolver so basically put those two things together we are up about $5.5 million at the midpoint on our interest expense guidance. And that negatively impact the AFFO. But will certainly help -- positively impact the AFFO per share as a lot of those dollars are going to buy back stock. 
Richard Prentiss: Great and then when we think forward to next quarter historical you guys will give the future year guidance, are you still expecting on the third quarter call to give 2016 guidance and how do you feel about the visibility of the different carriers by then?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: We will definitely give full year guidance then and I think we are actually looking forward to it because we will be able to talk about a year where our iDEN terminations have ended. We believe that there is a very good likelihood that certain U.S. customer will come off historically low spending activity. We’ll take a fresh look at the exchange rate. So we expect to have the same visibility Ric that we always have in any type of outlook which is you know pretty good six months ahead. So I think we will have a good dialog. 
Richard Prentiss: And I think the streets are looking forward to that third quarter call and the 2016 guidance as well?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. 
Richard Prentiss: Great, thanks guys. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead please.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes, I was interested in maybe drilling down in Brazil a little bit in terms of what has been the drivers, is it Vivo, is it Tim, is it 3G overlays, 4G initial coverage if you characterize that a little bit, as well as your appetite in that market potentially for mom and pop acquisitions?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: I believe Jonathan in the order of contribution that has been Vivo, Tim, Claro, Oi and Oi would be expected to be where they are because we bought most of our towers from them. So they already have some presence on almost every asset that we own. In terms of our additional appetite, we very much have an interest in continuing to invest the Reais that were the positive cash flow and Reais that we are generating down there in additional asset growth whether it would be new power bills or acquisitions. And we are pleasantly surprised to see a nice cottage mom and development market growing down there that would give us a chance to continue to grow through small to medium acquisitions for a long time. 
Jonathan Atkin: And then on the U.S. wondered if you could been sure kind of a rough guess or timeframe around AWS-3 and when that might start to happen, is it going to be three carriers deploying that and MWCS which is obviously just one carrier any sense as to when that might become noticeable in 2016?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, I don’t have a quarter for you Jonathan. I don’t believe it will be 2015 but that will be something that will have at least a three months better view on when we give out our full year guidance at our next call. 
Jonathan Atkin: And then on the small cell topic, are you seeing any demands on your macro sites perhaps at lower hype that’s driven by some of the same drivers that are driving the small cell opportunity?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes we are. We absolutely -- we’ve leased up a fair number of positions at approximately the 20 to 30 foot level which of course is typically an open spot on the tower and a great incremental source of revenue for us and stuff we are going to be excited about going forward. 
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you we have a question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Go ahead please. 
Amir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much. When we think about your guidance for the duration of the year it sounds like there is no real expectation for a change in the current spending environment that we are seeing and certainly even if there was it doesn’t seem like that would really impact this year. But can you give us an update in terms of what you are seeing in terms of bookings activities or maybe some of the initial conversation that you are having with some of the carriers to maybe give us a sense in terms of where the trajectory could fall out?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: We clearly are seeing upticks in our backlog. I think your first comment Amir was spot on. I mean you know this business if you don’t really have your operational lease up signed by the end of September it will really typically not impact your full year financial results. As a fact of the matter we have about two months left of operational leasing activity in the U.S. to impact full year results. But looking past all that, we are very pleased with what we are seeing on the backlogs and the build and we have every reason to believe that activity levels across -- in the aggregate when you take all four carriers in the U.S. together we will be up in 2016. 
Amir Rozwadowski: Thank you and then one follow up if I may, when you were thinking about sort of your capital allocation decisions, I mean clearly the buyback sort of percolated to the top in terms of return criteria for you folks over the last couple of months, any sense you can give us in terms of expectations for AFFO growth over the long-term that sort of baked into this calculation of intrinsic value that you guys are looking at?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: We are still battling everyday for 15% to 20% compound growth in the AFFO per share. 
Amir Rozwadowski: Great, thank you very much for the incremental color. 
Operator: Thank you we’ll go next to Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please. 
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great, thank you for taking the questions. Two if I can; first, I just wanted to swing back to ExteNet make sure I fully understood your commentary on the sale Jeff. So you are talking about two times on your investment back, you invested at 43 million, does that mean you are going to see gross proceeds of around 130 million, just wanted to make sure I understood that and then what’s the timing of the receipt on that payment?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: No Jonathan, I mean there is going to be some variability here because there is an earn out period that ends March 31. So when we say two times are better that would be the gross proceeds to us would be that multiple of what we invested, the 43 million. 
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thank you. So we have been spending a lot of time I think talking about Brazil, I don’t know when the last time we sort of walked through some of the other markets that you have exposure to on the international side, I was wondering if you might spend a minute sort of talking through some of the dynamics in those markets, thanks? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, we had huge lease up buy by at least the last four to eight quarters averages in Central America, particularly in Panama, Nicaragua, and Guatemala and Costa Rica and El Salvador continued to be very steady. So we were very, very pleased with Central America. Canada continues to be steady but given the size of our asset base there and good growth but not at the same level that we had in Central America and certainly not as good as we had in Brazil, continues to move forward. At this point though we have got such a low tower cash flow multiple up there to invested capital that it’s a great yielding market for us. 
Jonathan Schildkraut: Excellent and if I can ask just one more question, given the movements in the Reais based on the second quarter results, what percent of revenue is currently coming out of Brazil? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Brazil within our 2015 guidance is projected to contribute about 11.5% of the total leasing revenue. A little bit less than actually on cash leasing revenue basis. 
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thank you for taking the questions. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Go ahead please.
Colby Synesael: Hey, just wanted to go back to the buyback. Appreciate that you spent a thing about 90 million, I guess year-to-date in the third quarter but obviously you have taken out that 2015 just expense, just trying to get a sense of pacing as you go forward, would you expect to continue to I mean on the buyback really is it going to the end of the year assuming there is any additional M&A opportunities or could we see that I guess slowdown? And then my next question I guess just more broadly as you go into 2016 and you start to get a better sense of what the domestic operators are planning or intending to do, does it make sense to actually put an MLA in place with any of those carriers which could be I guess beneficial for both parties? Thanks.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Colby we intend to stay capitalized at relatively all times at our target leverage levels. So as I mentioned portfolio growth remains the number one priority but it has to meet our standard requirement firms and returns. And if we can find that that’s where the capital investment will go and if not and we stand by our stock at prices that we believe are below intrinsic value, that’s what we’ll do. So I don’t know that you should assume up or down, whether it will be one or the other I think will depend on the portfolio growth opportunities that we see and our views on intrinsic value of the stock.  In terms of MLAs, we have them with Sprint, we have them with T-Mobile. It’s not as if there is an absolute aversion. It’s all about the terms and conditions. So that means the hypothetical or the theoretical answer to your question is of course if there are things that we do in fact find mutually beneficial. But in terms of our history we’re extremely happy that we did not do some of the MLAs that have been done. And has allowed us to capture every bit of activity and monetize that which today is the course of the permanent escalating part of our recurrent revenue base. So that’s what we are really focused on and if an MLA can allow that to happen sure, we’d be interested. 
Colby Synesael: So I guess just to go back to the buyback then, from a modeling perspective we are not assuming in our models any additional M&A beyond what the company has already talked about or disclosed basically holding on to the low end of your target leverage ratio and assuming everything else goes to buyback is probably a prudent way of thinking about it?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, I mean particularly if otherwise your models would have us below our target leverage range. 
Colby Synesael: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael McCormack with Jeffries. Please go ahead. 
Michael L McCormack: Hey, guys thanks. Jeff just another question I guess on the small cell side, is your thought process there does it have anything to do with your thoughts regarding carriers to entry in small cell or alternatively what you are seeing as far as pricing trends in small cell? And then I guess secondly on the AT&T side, their commentary regarding spending this year including Mexican spending obviously means maybe a little more dampening in the U.S. although you said something like it was more positive in the current quarter, how do you think about second half with respect to AT&T specifically?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well let me take your second question first. I mean my comment was that they were more active than first quarter. But first quarter was at levels that I don’t think we’ve seen on an absolute spend basis from that customer for as far as long as I can remember. So the spending on a historical average is way down and we’ve been at this for a long time. And that dynamic while it of course makes for our traditional [indiscernible] quarters here, a little more difficult in 2015. I think it touches up extremely well for 2015.  And on the small cell question we had a window seat there for a very long time and we saw all aspects of the business and you mentioned two reasons Mike, but there are 10, 20, 30 other reasons why we just simply prefer the macro site business. And for us it’s all about maximizing AFFO per share and we believe that through our decision making we are going to put ourselves in the best position to do that. 
Michael L McCormack: Great, thanks guys. 
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Go ahead please. 
Phil Cusick: Hey guys, thanks. I guess Jeff could you talk a little bit about -- remind of us of iDEN churn headwind in 2015 and is there any expectation of abnormal merger churn in 2016?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Brendan. 
Brendan T. Cavanagh: So Phil, the impacts from the churn that’s taking place in 2015, on 2015 is about $16 million. Although a lot of that churn is in the fourth quarter. So October 1st is kind of a big churn day that we have due to the tower portfolio we bought a few years ago which had more of a kind of a cliff termination that they’ve agreed to. And that’ll basically be about $6.5 million approximately of quarterly revenue that goes away on October 1st.
Phil Cusick: Okay, and anything for 2016 that we should be thinking about?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: As it relate to iDEN churn?
Phil Cusick: No, from other merger churn?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Nothing that would be outside of our normal 1% to 1.5% of churn that we typically see as our average. 
Phil Cusick: Okay. 
Mark DeRussy: Let’s be clear on that. I mean our non-iDEN churn in the U.S. this quarter was 1%. I mean we are not seeing any kind of aberrational activity there Phil, we don’t expect any. 
Phil Cusick: And we’ve now seen by the time now where you guys haven’t bought anything, is it fair to say that given the higher currency volatility that we’ve seen in the last year, that you are hurt already for doing deals outside of the U.S. is maybe higher than it was before?
Mark DeRussy: Yes, more than fair to say that. 
Phil Cusick: Okay, thanks guys. 
Operator: And thank you, we’ll go next to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. 
Brett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question and just thinking ahead to the broadcast incentive option, we been so focused on site densification but those are going to be the lowest frequencies we’ve ever seen and those are frequencies that are generally well suited for towers. And so with that as the back drop can you maybe just give us some update or statistics on your portfolio for example to what extent are your towers situated in rural and suburban markets, where we are likely going to see a lot of deployments maybe average heights? I think just as a follow up, do you think there is an opportunity to maybe increase your construction of towers as a result of that option?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: We believe the upcoming activity, particularly the low frequency spectrum and even the AWS-3 and the other spectrum like FirstNet for example that’s going to become available is going to be a boon to the non-urban market. And that of course is where we are primarily located. I have to refresh myself Brett on where we are in terms of demographics but I believe 50% of our U.S. towers are located in the top 100 markets and then of course the other 50 would be outside of that. I believe our current average heights are 175 to maybe 200 or more. So, we have got plenty of capacity there. To the extent that there is activity outside the cities, we are going to get more than our fair share and I am pretty optimistic that is in fact going to happen. 
Brett Feldman: Great, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. 
Michael Bowen: Thanks for taking the questions. You’d mentioned that you are expecting to see a pickup in the second half, I was wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit about which carriers specifically you might be looking at there and then also I guess same question for 2016, I know that you would also mention that Sprints in very, very low but they are coming off that low spending activity or to be planning to so you can talk a little bit about perhaps timing of what you are seeing with the lease up would be great, thanks?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Now keep in mind when we say pickup an activity, we are talking about operational activity and not financial activity. But having said that, I think the pickup is going to come from AT&T and Sprint, probably more so from the former and depending on the timing of the new next generation plans. Still little unclear but once that does emerge that is going to be an increasing activity for the entire industry. 
Michael Bowen: Okay and then quickly back on iDEN, I apologize did you say there would or would not be an impact from iDEN termination in 2016? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It would be nothing of any note in 2016. 
Michael Bowen: Okay, great. Thanks guys. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. 
Simon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. I think you mentioned Jeff about the value for the buyback being well below intrinsic value. Can you just give us a little bit more color on how you go back sort of assessing intrinsic value and by all means give us an actual number or…?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: You have to save that one for the bar Simon after you buy me a couple of cocktails.
Simon Flannery: Sounds like a big spread and then on AT&T, coming back to that commentary, they are obviously in this grooming period after spending heavily, can you just look back at similar periods in history, how long can you really go without spending significant or adding capacity when you have this sort of growth we’re seeing in the traffic right now, is that a year, is that 18 months, any color on that would be great? Thanks. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It’s never really been longer than a year or so Simon. And again I said this earlier and it’s hard to over emphasize, we’ve never quite seen this particular customer at this low level of spend. So I am pretty confident and have every reason to believe things are going to pickup and that’s one of the key drivers behind why we are buying back our stock. And in terms of how we think about that, we look at a variety of metrics. We look at our five year model going forward and project where AFFO per share is going to be. We look at TCFs, we obviously we look at industry comps and look at where private multiples are trading. And so we trying to triangulate all that back, come up with a price that we will buy at. We are not formula buyers, we are opportunistic buyers. And depending on pricing there maybe periods of time where we go for a while without buying stock and there may be other periods of time where we jump in with both feet.
Simon Flannery: And on the available cash, is the M&A -- the lack of M&A is there partly fewer opportunities or higher prices or is it mostly the hurdle rate comment that you mentioned earlier?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well higher price is equal hurdle rate issues. So I mean we actually had a pretty good quarter in terms of the U.S. towers that we acquired. But we also passed on a lot of towers that we thought looked no better than and perhaps worse than the towers we own that were trading it four times or more are public tower cash flow multiples. So we will pay higher multiples but we have to see greater growth and we have to see other reasons that to do that otherwise it makes most financial sense to pass on those that don’t meet the hurdle rate and see if you, your stock is at a price that is below intrinsic value. 
Simon Flannery: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Next we have Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead. 
Spencer Kurn: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Verizon has mentioned that they started refarming some of their PCS spectrum from EVDO to LTE and AT&T has also mentioned that they are pulling from some of their AWS spectrum from the leap onto their own sites. Could you just remind us, are there activities that you can generate revenue through amendments or what are the parameters around that? Thanks. 
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, it would depend on the specific task. Typically when the refarming is done there are antenna swaps and sometimes we don’t charge anything for that and sometimes we charge more than the minimust amount depending on what is leaving and what is being swapped out. To the extent remote radio heads are being added where none existed previously. That of course is a new weighty piece of equipment that goes on the tower that will generate additional amendment revenue. 
Spencer Kurn: Got it, so, I don’t know if you’ve seen any of this activity yet but if you have, have you been able to monetize it?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: We have seen it and we have been able to monetize some of it when it met the characteristics I just described. 
Spencer Kurn: Great, thanks so much. 
Operator: Okay, thank you. Then our next question is from Walter Paychest [ph] with BTID [ph]. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, just want to come back to the key and thanks for that historical perspective that was helpful. You know they’ve talked on the conference call about how they are try to use spectrum more than sites, I would assume that you would see that if that was actually the case, that they would actually be coming back to the sites and gaining access in order to have the spectrum, can you comment on that whether you can validate that statement that they have made? And also same kind of question, have they even deploying this WCS spectrum, that I think they have been planning to put into service?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: On the latter Walter I don’t think we’ve seen much of that yet and we kind of track all that because part of our process even though we don’t charge on a frequency specific basis we do track very diligently what frequencies are being used at particular sites. 
Unidentified Analyst: Can I just interject, any sense on what’s going on with the delay in that because I think they originally said 2014 and then it went into 2015, any -- from the engineers that you talk to what the issue is with WCS and why it is not getting deployed? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops: I would have no input on that. And in terms of your other question we are seeing them but we are just not seeing them anywhere close to historical levels. And I am not even talking about the kind of off the charts activity that we saw in the four quarters ending Q3 of 2014. I am even talking five years prior to that. And what I believe is going on is very smart guys there, they were on great organization, and they are managing their free cash flow based on a number of initiatives that if you probably look at what is going on there it’s pretty big year of cash uses between DirecTV, the AWS spend, Mexico. That’s really simply all I believe it is. I would be very surprised if AT&T has changed its long-term views on wanting to always be a network leader and I don’t think they have changed that and I think that would bode well for future investment.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure and then the ebb and flow comment about that you would have answered, I think it was to Simon’s question about kind of never really last longer than a year or so, is that specific to AT&T or is that kind of a general comment to any operator that starts to pull back on CAPEX on a given year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: I think I would say that would be more, you might limit that comment to Verizon and AT&T. 
Unidentified Analyst: Got it and then one last question on Verizon because you did mentioned that you kind of track their spectrum, usage and what’s getting out there. PCS, the last commentary that they made was they put it in a dozen markets, additional markets after they put some of ADB spectrum, have you seen any additional activity on them being more active in the point PCS in additional markets, let’s call these three months to six months? 
Brendan T. Cavanagh: I know they are doing some of that with us. I don’t have the specifics so Walter as to which markets and whether it’s more or less then what you might have thought. 
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks for your comments. 
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: We thank you then. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our Q&A session, do you have any closing remarks. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, I want to thank everybody for being on the call today and we look forward to our next call where we talk about our third quarter results and our views around 2016. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA first quarter results call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you. And good morning, and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2015 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, April 24, 2015, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Brendan to comment on our first quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another strong quarter in all areas. Notwithstanding FX headwinds during the quarter, we were above the mid-point of our guidance for site leasing revenue and met or exceeded the high end of our guidance for tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.  GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $369.7 million or a 19.5% increase over the first quarter of 2014. Domestic cash site leasing revenue increased 11.1% to $298.5 million and international cash site leasing revenue increased 92.5% to $57 million. Eliminating the impact of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, site leasing revenue would have increased 22.7% over the year earlier period and international cash leasing revenue would've increased 121.8%.  Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including our two recent acquisitions in Brazil. iDEN-related churn during the quarter had a negative impact of $1.4 million.  We continued to experience solid leasing demand both domestically and internationally. Approximately two-thirds of our incremental leasing activity in the quarter came from new leases. The big four US carriers contributed approximately 70% of our consolidated incremental leasing revenue signed up in the quarter.  Tower cash flow for the first quarter of 2015 was $284 million or a 19.6% increase over the year earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, tower cash flow would've increased 22% over the first quarter of 2014. Tower cash flow margin was 79.9% compared to 79.6% in the year-earlier period.  Our services revenues were $40.4 million compared to $36.2 million in the year-earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $9.5 million in the first quarter compared to $8.8 million in the first quarter of 2014. Services segment operating profit margin was 23.5% compared to 24.3% in the year-earlier period.  SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $29.9 million, including non-cash compensation charges of $6.9 million. SG&A expenses were $24.7 million in the year earlier period, including non-cash compensation charges of $4.5 million. The increase in cash SG&A over the first quarter of 2014 was due primarily to increases in personnel and other support costs associated with our portfolio expansion over the last 12 months, as well as an increase in medical insurance costs.  Adjusted EBITDA was $271 million or an increase of 19.6% over the year-earlier period. Eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA would've increased 21.9% over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.5% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 67.8% in the year-earlier period. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business.  AFFO increased 20% to $184.6 million compared to $153.8 million in the first quarter of 2014. AFFO per share increased 19.5% to $1.41 compared to $1.18 in the first quarter of 2014. Combined changes in the Brazilian and Canadian exchange rates during the first quarter versus the rates assumed in our guidance negatively impacted leasing revenue by $1.2 million and adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by approximately $700,000 each.  Net loss during the first quarter was $79 million compared to net income of $1.4 million in the year-earlier period. Net loss for the first quarter of 2015 included an $84 million loss on the currency-related remeasurement of a US dollar denominated intercompany loan with our Brazilian subsidiary.  Net loss per share for the first quarter of 2015 was $0.61 compared to net income per share of $0.01 in the year-earlier period. Quarter-end shares outstanding were 129.4 million. In the first quarter, we acquired 59 communication sites for $42.6 million in cash. SBA also built 107 sites during the first quarter. We ended the quarter with 24,393 sites, 15,151 of these sites are in the US and its territories, and 9,242 are in international markets.  Total cash capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2015 were $121.4 million consisting of $7.4 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures, such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $114 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the first quarter includes $42.6 million incurred in connection with acquisitions, excluding working capital adjustments. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $31 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress and $22.2 million for gross augmentations and tower upgrades. The substantial majority of augmentation CapEx is reimbursed to us by our customers.  During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $14 million to buy land and easement and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 73% of our towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control is approximately 33 years.  At this point, I will turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the first quarter with $8 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $108.6 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times.  Our first-quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.5 times. During the quarter we settled the remaining outstanding warrants related to our 4% convertible notes for $150.9 million in cash, of which $15.6 million was actually paid in the second quarter. There are no further obligations related to the 4% notes or these warrants.  Also, during the first quarter we amended our revolver by increasing the size of the facility from $770 million to $1 billion and by extending the maturity date to February 2020. We also reduced the interest spread by between 37.5 basis points and 50 basis points depending upon the leverage at the borrower level. We currently have $235 million outstanding under the revolver and based on specified covenants we have available to us today $765 million.  At the end of the quarter, our total debt carried a weighted average coupon of 3.9% and a weighted average maturity of just under 5.5 years. We did not purchase any shares of common stock during the quarter and currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization.  With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. As you’ve heard we started the year with solid results, exceeding either the midpoint or the high end of our guidance across almost all key financial metrics. Organic leasing activity and strong expense control were the primary reasons for our outperformance.  We continued to see solid demand across our entire portfolio both domestic and international as well as in our services segment. Projections of smartphone penetration and use of wireless data remain robust. Corporations as varied as Google, Facebook, IBM, General Motors and Microsoft have materially increased their focus on and investment in wireless which is expected to further increase usage. Satisfying this type of growth will require additional network capacity either in the form of more spectrum, more infrastructure or as has historically been the case, both. Carrier willingness to invest in additional network capacity has been well evidenced recently with the AWS-3 spectrum auction in the US as well as other spectrum auctions internationally. We expect solid levels of activity for years to come as carriers increase [ph] their network capacity as use of wireless data, including voice over LTE marches ever higher.  The revenue opportunities for SBA from the AWS-3 spectrum auction alone should last for years once deployment has begun which we expect sometime in 2016. After that is the planned 600 MHz auction which we think will bring similar opportunities to SBA. The need for and the catalyst behind additional network investment continue on and we see no end in sight. These dynamics are at play in all our markets both domestically and internationally.  In the first quarter, we experienced solid leasing demand across our entire portfolio both domestic and international. Same tower cash leasing revenue growth compared to the year ago prior period was 10.5% on a gross constant currency basis and 7.5% on a net of churn basis, including iDEN related churn.  Our domestic same tower growth rate was 10.8% on a gross basis and 7.3% on a net basis while our international organic growth rate was 10% both gross and net on a currency neutral basis. Our international growth rate reflects the initial inclusion of 2100 low-cost wireline towers we purchased in Brazil and our initial Oi acquisition. We attribute our leasing success to a combination of quality assets, strong execution, good contracts and excellent demand from our customers.  In the first quarter, in the US the leasing demand environment was similar to that which we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014 and consistent with our expectations when we first put forth our 2015 outlook in November. Solid but below the record activity levels we saw in the first three quarters of 2014. In total we executed high numbers of both new tenant leases and amendments.  Revenue from new leases was greater than that from amendments and represented approximately 60% of the incremental leasing revenue in the United States. Verizon and T-Mobile represented the majority of our new business in the quarter. AT&T was active but at reduced levels compared to the year ago period. The reduction in activity with AT&T was expected and it’s not surprising or concerning given the large amounts invested by AT&T in the prior 36 months.  Contributions from Sprint due to its 2.5 GHz and Clearwire upgrade projects remained about the same as the last several quarters with an increasing amount of discussion around Sprint's next-generation network plans. Our backlogs continue to be healthy. We continue to expect that leasing activity levels will be higher in the second half of the year which depending on timing may or may not impact 2015 results. At a minimum this would bode well for 2016.  We continue to see strong activity in our international markets. As expected, new leases represented the majority of the activity contributing approximately 80% of the total incremental international leasing revenue added in the quarter. International cash leasing revenue and tower cash flow growth grew materially year-over-year once again primarily due to portfolio growth.  International tower cash flow margins were strong although below year-earlier margins due to the two Oi acquisitions we closed last year. GAAP requires us to mark-up our revenue and expenses by the amount of ground lease expenses reimbursed to us by our customers, so the true economic cash flow margins in Brazil are much higher.  I continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Brazil and look forward to continuing our positive momentum. While we are disappointed with the negative movement of the Brazilian real against the US dollar and the resulting impact on our 2015 outlook, we remain convinced that Brazil will be an excellent long-term investment.  While the near-term economic picture in Brazil is challenging, demographic trends, smartphone sales, network needs, new spectrum and the competitive carrier dynamic all lead us to continue to believe that Brazil will be a growth market for network investment for many years to come. Our investment focus for Brazil for the remainder of the year will likely focus on new builds and smaller acquisitions and we would like to reinvest all Brazilian reais we are generating back into the business.  Our services segment produced another quarter of strong results for us in the first quarter, once again with the primary contributor being Sprint as well as solid activity levels with T-Mobile and Verizon. We expect a steady services segment contribution through all of 2015.  Our operational performance across the entire company was very strong. In the first quarter we posted record tower cash flow margins in the US of 81.9%. Strong tower cash flow and services margins drove our adjusted EBITDA margin to a record 68.5%. We think to have produced that level of margin while growing materially internationally and increasing SG&A expense to manage that international growth is a real accomplishment. The strong adjusted EBITDA results we had in the first quarter drove our equally strong AFFO and AFFO per share results.  Our updated 2015 outlook reflects essentially the same views on carrier activity, organic growth rates and services as we put forth in November, increased for some additional investment portfolio growth but decreased to a greater extent from unfavorable changes in the Brazilian real to US dollar exchange rate. Our 2015 outlook now contemplates approximately 9% gross, same tower cash revenue growth on a constant currency basis before iDEN churn. We have included no material contribution in 2015 from DISH, Public Safety or any other customer that was not reasonably active in 2004.  Our balance sheet remains in great shape and additional capital, if needed, remains readily available. We intend to continue our balance sheet strategy and maintain our existing leverage targets as we believe them to contribute materially to shareholder value creation. We have returned our focus on capital allocation back toward portfolio growth and share repurchases.  With respect to portfolio growth, we will look both domestically and internationally and believe that we will continue to find attractive opportunities that will meet our investment requirements. Our primary focus remains in the Western Hemisphere. Our new tower build activities are off to a good start and we are reaffirming our goal of 5% to 10% portfolio growth in 2015 while maintaining our target leverage levels. If we are successful in consummating some additional acquisitions, I would expect our 2015 outlook to increase.  I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in the first quarter and our customers for continuing to entrust us with their business. We look forward to continued success as we move through 2015. And Christie, at this time we’re ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go directly to the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC. 
Jonathan Atkin : I was interested in your thoughts on the DAS opportunity and how you might participate in that apart from your existing minority stake in ExteNet and then internationally I was interested in – I didn’t quite understand the 80% number, new leasing 20% and then if you strip out portfolio growth I guess what I'm interested in is particularly in Brazil, what's driving the growth on the same store basis, is it new leases or is it amendments, coverage build, et cetera?
Jeffrey Stoops: I will cover the international, first, Jonathan. Yes, the 80% is not portfolio growth, it’s incremental revenue. So obviously 80%, vast majority of that activity is coming from new leases as you would expect in markets like Brazil where there is still tremendous coverage needs. On the DAS side, the business certainly has some attractions. We are participating today in terms of a number of small cell deployments. We’re actually signing up a bunch of small cells on a number of our towers. It's interesting they are generally being placed at the 30 foot mark and we’re getting what we think are some very fair and good rents for that. So we continue to watch the area, it looks to be developing positively. And we expect to continue to pay attention there.
Jonathan Atkin : And any thoughts on what's going on in Mexico, from an outside perspective goal or potentially participating in that market?
Jeffrey Stoops: I think we’re going to continue to watch how things develop particularly with the Telesat spinoff and see what that does to tower competition in that market. 
Operator: And our next question is from Ric Prentiss, Raymond James.
Ric Prentiss : First question I have got is on the external growth. Last quarter you guys mentioned, you thought some more deals might close by the end of 2Q and now it seems like those deals have maybe slipped into 3Q. Talk a little bit about the timing of closings and also prices being paid, it seems like price per tower is high, that’s not the best metric but we don't really get to see how much tower cash flow is coming in?
Brendan Cavanagh: Hey Ric, it’s Brendan. On the timing, as we sign up few additional deals, we’re basically letting you know that we expect all of the deals that under contract to close by the end of the third quarter, some of them will probably close during the second quarter which you could probably tell from our guidance around second-quarter CapEx. So it’s not really slippage in terms of timing, it’s more just added some deals that will actually be in the third quarter. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, Rick, on the pricing, there continues to be a strong bid for quality US tower assets. Depending on the maturity of the asset, we’re looking at high teens to low 20s tower cash flow multiples. 
Ric Prentiss : And any update on your NOLs and the reconversion. The reason I ask is the MSCI is going to introduce the new real estate section which could attract some more generalist into the tower space but only through a REIT. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, Brendan, why don’t you give you an update on the NOL and I will share our thoughts on reconversion. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, we still have a substantial federal NOLs, it's approximately $1.3 billion today. We did have a little bit of taxable income in 2014 but it was minuscule to say the least. So we still have pretty much our full NOL at this point and I think from a timing standpoint on reconversion we have done a lot of work to prepare ourselves to convert whatever we feel the time is right but as long as we have the NOLs and we feel good about our strategy I think for the time being, we’re content today on the same path. 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I would only add to that, that we got ourselves ready to go with, Ric, when there were some proposals made a year, perhaps long ago now that looked like they could change the definitions and the qualifications for REIT status. That no longer appears to be a front burner item or even a mid burner item in Congress ahead of the presidential elections. So we’re continuing to watch all that carefully but as Brendan said we believe it’s in our best interest and those of our shareholders to not really convert into a REIT before we feel we have to.
Ric Prentiss : And from I think previously thought that was kind of on the back end of this decade, is that still kind of the thoughts?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes maybe slightly earlier a lot of our investment has been done internationally which has less impact on our projections related to future losses in the US. So I would say somewhere around maybe 2018 would be the current estimate in terms of timing. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Richard Choe : Hey, this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow up on the international. Are you seeing any negative impacts to the economy or the growth given the FX issues? And then on the small cells, it seems like this is a business that you might be able to develop on your own, is that something that we should look for?
Jeffrey Stoops: We could develop that business on our own and then as I mentioned earlier we are watching all aspects of that very carefully. So you should stay tuned on that front. And on the international side, there’s not any direct evidence that the reais and the Brazilian economy is directly impacting carrier activity but we believe in general, Richard, that there has to be some impact that has permeated all through the Brazilian society and the carriers down there are not immune to that. So I can't quantify for you what exactly that impact is but I do think the reais and the general economic conditions down there do have an impact. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden, Bank of America. 
David Barden : Jeff, I think you alluded to the possibility that the second half would be much more heavily weighted in the first half. I guess Verizon and AT&T clearly under-spent in 1Q and reiterated their full year, are you getting a sense that maybe the second quarter isn't seeing a catch-up or is there any kind of caveat there? And then the second question was just in regards to your conversations with Sprint on the next generation plans. Are you getting any kind of color that there is a potential breakout here for the company on that as they do seem to be kind of lacking a network story, then we've heard so much about them working on it that it will be great to get your insights on where they are on that?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, on your first question, David, you're exactly right. We have not yet -- first of all, we do believe that carrier activity is going to pick up in the second half but we haven't seen it yet. And because we haven't seen it yet, we did not reflect it in an increase in our outlook. It’s really exactly that simple as to where things are sitting today. We do believe it's going to happen but until we actually see tangible signs of it, it’s not going to show up in our projections. So that's where we sit today.  On the Sprint side, there's a lot of discussions going on and there are some pricing discussions going on and a variety of different things about the next generation network plans, very exciting and I think are going to bode very well for our company. What's unclear is the timing of that and whether that is going to have a material impact on our 2015 results. And again because we don't have certainty around that that is not included in our outlook.
Operator: And our next question is from Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery : Just going back to Brazil on the currency, can you just reminds us of the escalator structure to the extent that weaker currency drives inflation higher, presumably can we capture some of that by your escalators? So how does that work, what’s your portfolio looking like in terms of inflation exposure and then any sort of time like associated with that? And maybe you could just touch on Central America as well, any updates on the trends there?
Jeffrey Stoops: Simon, on the FX or escalators in our leasing contracts, all of our tenant leases in Brazil have escalators that are tied to an index -- a cost-of-living index, basically a CPI equivalent that reflects inflationary rates. So to the extent that those are higher which tends to be the case when we have this weakness that we are seeing relative to the US dollar in terms of FX rate they tend to be higher. The timing of us to get the benefit of that though depends on when those leases escalate and so they all escalate to dates. A lot of them escalate on the acquisitions that we did in terms of the leasebacks typically on the anniversary of the closing date. So for instance on April 1, we had a fairly sizable escalation due to the second Oi deal that we closed April 1 of last year and that was at a much higher rate than previous escalations we’ve seen but we generally don't see it until we actually hit those escalation dates.
Brendan Cavanagh: In terms of Central America, Simon, everything there is escalated on a fixed rate like we do in the US, so everything is paid in US dollars. But in terms of activity we had a great second-quarter Central America. We actually had a number of pleasantly surprising large deployments particularly in Panama that – for the entire region, put us well ahead of plan there for the year. So Central America continues to go very well for us. 
Operator: Our next question is from Colby Synesael, Cowen and Company.
Colby Synesael : You mentioned again I think the second-quarter now increased interest in buybacks, that obviously we didn’t see any in the first quarter. Is it fair to assume that we can see them as soon as the second quarter, just give us little bit more color on, is that what you are thinking right now or at least the buybacks and how that’s different? And then the second question, I think you mentioned your guidance contemplates same tower gross – excuse me, organic growth of around I think 9%. Can you break that out by international versus the US?
Jeffrey Stoops: On the stock buyback, Colby, everything we do from a capital allocation perspective starts with where we want to capitalize the company. So keeping the business levered at 7 to 7.5 times now that we've satisfied the warrants don't have to devote capital to that any longer. I mean we’re going to have a lot of money that we’re going to be able to invest. Our primary focus as it always has been, will continue to be portfolio growth but to the extent that we don't find opportunities there that we like that meet our return requirements we will be directing those funds towards stock buybacks. I am not going to sit and tell you how much on any particular quarter, I don’t think that’s in our best interest to do that. But I will tell you that now with the warrants behind us, the odds of stock buybacks have gone up quite a bit. 
Brendan Cavanagh: And Colby, on your second question about the growth rate of 9%, we expect the domestic growth rate to be very close to 9% as well with the international being higher at just north of 10%. 
Operator: Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs, your line is open.
Brett Feldman : I think the question, we’ve seen so many large portfolios trade in the US that lot of investors think there’s not much left out there anymore. Since you still remain focused on portfolio growth, I was hoping you could just give us an assessment of what you see, are there any carrier portfolios that are maybe smaller scale that you might be interested in, and in general, do you think that there are enough privately held towers you might be able to acquire in the US that meet your return criteria or is that one of the reasons why you are thinking that you may do more and more buybacks?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, going back years, Brett, to the time when we made the decision to go international, it really stemmed from this issue which is that we want to continue to have enough of a geographic playing field so that we could stay fully invested to our target leverage desires through portfolio growth. So as the world has progressed, there's been less and less available in the US in terms of big deals. But I will tell you and our results I think show in our backlogs and the things that we’re working on that aren't yet under agreement there's a lot of smaller opportunities there that give me great confidence that we can certainly hit the low end of our portfolio of growth goals of at least 5% or maybe more in the US. There's plenty of opportunities through building and buying to allow us to do that. And that will get weighed against international opportunities or that will get weighed against the stock repurchases and we will allocate capital that we think will result in the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Brett Feldman : And just a follow up, I mean to the extent you are still buying assets in the US, are you buying traditional tower assets or are you increasingly finding at rooftops or land acquisitions or things that are sort of close adjacent to what you do are also part of those acquisitions as well?
Jeffrey Stoops: No, we are buying traditional towers.
Operator: Up next is Michael Bowen, Pacific Crest. 
Michael Bowen : Couple, I guess, first, Brendan, just wanted to get clarification. I think last quarter you had stated that the international growth would be slightly more than 13% and I think a minute ago you said around – you said north of 10%. So if you could just clarify that. And then second question, there was a new antenna law pass very recently down in Brazil supposedly allowing faster deployment, and other such thing, I was wondering if you guys had – I am assuming you’ve seen it and if you could comment on how that may or may not impact the business down there that would be great? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Michael, the actual growth rate that we saw internationally just a quarter ago was about 13%. We’re projecting a little north of 10% for this year because we’re now rolling in the impact of wireline sites that we added at the end of 2013 and those we expect to frankly grow at a slower pace, because they were much lower cost sites. And we do – yes, we’re very aware of the new law, we’re optimistic, it has a shot pot [ph] feature similar to what was adopted here in the United States. The trick down there, Michael, will be due to municipalities actually embraced it and adopted and followed it and if they do it should lead to simplification certainty and speed it up new build processes.
Michael Bowen : Is there any timing on when that goes into effect? I didn’t see anything in the release that I saw.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I'm not familiar with that. My understanding is it's either in effect now or to go in effect shortly. 
Operator: Next we will go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.
Amir Rozwadowski : Just going back to sort of understanding your thought process around the demand environment. Certainly you are all, as you mentioned before, some building expectations that the spending in the US will be second half weighted. You folks seem to be taking a more conservative approach and not factoring that into your outlook right now. But also, we’ve got sort of Sprint deciding on what they are doing in terms of their build, T-Mobile is focusing on the build-out of the band spectrum, of course the AWS-3 spectrum auction. How do you think about sort of not just over the course of this year but over the mid to longer-term demand cycle that we're seeing right now? I mean do you expect sort of current trends that seem to be a trough spending environment to gradually improve and continue for some time or how should we think about that trajectory?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, we’re very very excited about the future. What is at play right now is a historic low in some of our customers’ spending which we don't think by any stretch can be or will be long-term particularly as we look at the AWS-3 rollout. So as we think about the Sprint next-generation project, the AT&T, AWS-3, the work that T-Mobile has yet ahead of it and what Verizon kind of has done on a steady basis through the years I think 2016, ‘17 and beyond are pretty exciting times. So I do believe that these current quarters that we’re in, last quarter, the fourth quarter I think are aberrations and that these will be worked through as carriers come off of their spending break and get back to their historic steady heavy investment in network.
Amir Rozwadowski : And lastly just a quick follow up, Public Safety, when can we start to see builds around that, is that factored into your outlook currently for 2015?
Jeffrey Stoops: No, it is not and we are optimistic and hopeful that by the end of 2016 we can start to see some activity. 
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now go to the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is Will on for Kevin. Thank you for the question. We were just wondering if we can get an update on tenancy per tower in Brazil and maybe in the domestic market and how that's changed over the past 12 months? And then also if you had any color you said you were participating in a couple of small cell deployments. Do you have any sort of characteristics you can give us on the number of small cells being deployed for some geographic area or on a specific tower location?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, I will take the small cells. The deployments that we are seeing are on our towers in -- and towers that are located on the edges of urban markets. And what we've seen most commonly are three small cells, one on each base of the tower, basically it’s the word I am looking -- a sectorized installation there. We’re not involved other than through watching our investment and watching the industry yet through some of the other small cells type deployments that are going on, on streetlamps and things like that. So our direct exposure right now is through our own towers which we’re pleased to see.  In terms of tenants per tower, they will not have moved at all in Brazil giving the amount of new product that we have added to our portfolio over the last year. I'm guessing we’re around 1.3 tenants per tower, 1.4, you can call Mark and get some specifics on that, and we are moving up slightly the tenants per tower in the United States. I think we’re now maybe have gone from 1.9 to 2 and on these trends which are more new leases now than they were amendments, we would expect that to continue to increase.  End of Q&A
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. Please continue.
Jeffrey Stoops: Great. Well, thanks everyone for joining us and we look forward to reporting our second-quarter results. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy - Vice President, Finance: Thank you. And good morning, and thank you for joining us for SBA's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2015 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release as well as our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, February 27, 2015, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined by Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brendan to comment on our fourth quarter results.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another very strong quarter in all areas. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $361.4 million or a 23.6% increase over the fourth quarter of 2013. Domestic cash site leasing revenue increased 16.1% to $295.4 million, and international cash site leasing revenue increased 123.1% to $51.8 million. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including our three recent acquisitions in Brazil. iDEN-related churn during the quarter had a negative impact of $1.4 million. We continue to experience solid leasing demand, both domestically and internationally. Just over half of our incremental leasing activity in the quarter came from new leases. The big four U.S. carriers contributed approximately 75% of our consolidated incremental leasing revenue signed up in the quarter. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $277.9 million or a 27.7% increase over the year-earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 80% compared to 78.3% in the year-earlier period. Our services revenues were $43.3 million compared to $42.9 million in the year-earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $9.6 million in the fourth quarter compared to $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Services segment operating profit margin was 22.1% compared to 21.4% in the year-earlier period. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $26.6 million, including non-cash compensation charges of $5.3 million. SG&A expenses were $21.7 million in the year-earlier period, including non-cash compensation charges of $4.1 million. Increases were primarily attributable to increases in employee-related costs and specifically to head count increases in Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA was $266.7 million or an increase of 27.4% over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 65.3% in the year-earlier period. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 30.5% to $181.5 million compared to $139.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. AFFO per share increased 29.9% to $1.39 compared to $1.07 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Combined changes in the Brazilian and Canadian exchange rates during the fourth quarter versus the rates assumed in our guidance negatively impacted leasing revenue by $1 million and adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by approximately $500,000 each. Net come during the fourth quarter was $390,000 compared to a net loss of $19.2 million in the year-earlier period. Net income per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $0.00 per share compared to net loss of $0.15 per share in the year-earlier period. Quarter-end shares outstanding were 129.1 million. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1,703 sites for $520.5 million in cash, including 1,641 communication sites acquired from Oi in Brazil on December 1. SBA also built 175 sites during the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with 24,292 sites. 15,124 of these sites are in the U.S. and its territories, and 9,168 are in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $616.4 million, consisting of $7.2 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures, such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx, and $609.2 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the fourth quarter includes $520.5 million incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, excluding working capital adjustments. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $34.3 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress, and $30.1 million for gross augmentations and tower upgrades. The substantial majority of augmentation CapEx is reimbursed to us by our customers. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $19.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 73% of all of our towers and 74% of our domestic towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy - Vice President, Finance: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $7.9 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $98 million. Our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.5 times. On October 1, we settled the remaining outstanding principal of our 4% convertible notes for $360 million in cash and 8.7 million shares of common stock. The settlement was neutral to our share count as the stock portion of the transaction was fully hedged. Also during the quarter, we paid $282 million to early settle warrants, representing approximately $4.2 million underlying shares of stock, which were originally sold in connection with the issuance of the 4% notes. Subsequent to the fourth quarter, we settled additional warrants representing 1.2 million shares for $82.7 million. Pro forma for these settlements and based on the recent stock prices, our warrant liability consists of approximately 900,000 underlying shares with a value today of approximately $68 million. We expect to sell the remaining warrants in cash on or by April 2 of 2015. On October 15, we issued two tranches of Secured Tower Revenue Securities through our existing SBA Tower Trust, generating a total of $1.54 billion in gross proceeds. The offering had a weighted average coupon of 3.29% and a weighted average anticipated maturity of seven years. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay in full $680 million of outstanding Secured Tower Revenue Securities and to repay the $300 million outstanding balance under our revolver, which had been drawn to partially fund the October 1 settlement of our 4% notes, as well as for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and the settlement of warrants. In February of this year, we amended our revolver by increasing the size of the facility from $770 million to $1 billion and by extending the maturity date to February 2020. We also reduced the interest spread by between 37.5 basis points and 50 basis points, depending upon the borrower leverage. We currently have $175 million outstanding under the revolver. And based on specified covenants, we have available to us today $825 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, our total debt carried a weighted average coupon of 3.9% and had a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.5 years. We did not purchase any shares of stock during the quarter and currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As you have heard, we ended the year with great results, exceeding the high end of our guidance across almost all key financial metrics. Once again, we led our industry in many important growth metrics. Our organic leasing activity, which was particularly strong throughout 2014 and materially ahead of our initial expectations, was once again the primary reason for our outperformance. We continue to see strong demand across our entire portfolio, both domestic and international, as well as in our services segment. We expect to benefit from continued solid levels of activity for years to come, as carriers seek additional network capacity as consumer use marches ever higher. Projections of consumer use of wireless data remain robust. In Cisco's most recent wireless usage forecasts, global mobile data traffic is expected to increase almost 10-fold from 2014 to 2019, with nearly 75% of all the traffic in 2019 coming from video. This type of growth in usage and the capacity required for quality video transmission require constant attention to the network from our customers. Over the years, this type of demand and the resulting answers whether new spectrum auctions, densification or movements to next-generation technology have caused a continuous need for network investment by our customers. These dynamics are at play in both our domestic and international markets. Most recent event, the AWS-3 spectrum auction highlights the value of network capacity in the wireless industry and again elongates the future network investment period in the United States. Record amounts were raised for AWS-3 spectrum, which now must be deployed to earn a return for the winning participants and to comply with deployment requirements. The amounts raised could also fully fund the planned Public Safety network in the U.S. These revenue opportunities for SBA from the AWS-3 spectrum auction alone should last for years, once deployment has begun, which we expect sometime in 2016. After that is the planned 600-megahertz auction, which we think will bring similar opportunities to SBA. The need for and the catalysts behind additional network investment continue on, and we see no end in sight. In the fourth quarter, we once again experienced strong leasing demand across our entire portfolio, both domestic and international. Same tower cash leasing revenue growth compared to the year-ago prior period was 13.2% on a gross constant currency basis and 10.8% on a net-of-churn basis, including iDEN-related churn. The U.S. led on a gross basis, followed closely by Brazil. On a net currency control basis, Brazil led the company because there was no churn to speak of. We attribute our leasing success to a combination of quality assets, strong execution, good contracts and excellent demand from our customers. In the fourth quarter, in the U.S., we executed high numbers of both new tenant leases and amendments. For the first time in many quarters, revenue from new leases was greater than that from amendments and represented slightly above 50% of incremental leasing revenue in the U.S. This change in mix reflects both different priorities and different levels of activity among our customers. AT&T and Verizon represent once again the substantial majority of our new business in the quarter but less on a percentage basis than they have in prior quarters. We continue to have contributions from Sprint due to its Network Vision project and now also from the 2.5 gig project. T-Mobile seems to be increasing its level of activity on its 4G upgrade as well as on its LTE modernization project. Our backlogs continue to be healthy. We continue to see strong activity in our international markets. Leasing activity is mostly new leases, but there is a growing amount of amendment activity. Just over 50% of the total incremental international leasing revenue added in the quarter came from new leases. International cash leasing revenue and tower cash flow growth grew materially year-over-year, once again primarily due to portfolio growth. International tower cash flow margins were strong, although slightly below year-earlier margins, due to the two Oi acquisitions we closed last year. GAAP requires us to mark up our revenue and expenses by the amount of ground lease expenses reimbursed to us by our customers, so the to the true economic cash flow margins in Brazil are much higher. The second Oi closing of the year occurred as planned on December 1, and we ended the year with almost 7,000 towers in Brazil, making us the second largest tower company in that market. I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in Brazil and look forward to continuing our positive momentum. While we are disappointed with the negative movement of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar and the impact on our 2015 outlook, we remain convinced that Brazil will be an excellent long-term investment. Demographic trends, smartphone sales, network needs, new spectrum and the competitive carrier dynamic all lead us to continue to believe that Brazil will be a growth market for network investment for many years to come. This year we expect to build materially more towers in Brazil, funded from cash flows generated in Brazilian reals, without the need for any more investment of U.S. dollars. We don't see at this time anywhere near the size of the acquisition opportunities in Brazil in 2015 as we saw in 2014, but we do believe there will be a number of smaller acquisition opportunities that we will certainly evaluate. Our services segment produced another quarter of strong results for us in the fourth quarter, once again with the primary contributors being Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as increased activity levels with Verizon. We expect another solid services segment contribution through all of 2015. Our operational performance across the entire company was very strong in the fourth quarter. Strong tower cash flow and services margins drove our adjusted EBITDA margin to an industry-leading 68.3%, almost 300 basis points above the year-ago margin. We think to have produced that level of margin while growing materially internationally and increasing SG&A expense and manage that international growth is a real accomplishment. The strong adjusted EBITDA results we had in the fourth quarter drove our equally strong AFFO and AFFO per-share results, the latter of which, once again, materially led our industry. Our updated 2015 outlook reflects the same views on carrier activity, organic growth rates and services as we put forth in November, increased for some additional investment in portfolio growth but decreased to a greater extent from unfavorable changes in the Brazilian real to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Our 2015 outlook still contemplates between 9% and 10% same tower cash revenue growth on a constant currency basis before iDEN terminations. We have included no material contribution in 2015 from Dish, Public Safety or any other customer that was not reasonably active in 2014. Our balance sheet remains in great shape and additional capital, if needed, remains readily available. We recently increased our revolver to $1 billion and renewed its term for another five years. We intend to continue our balance sheet strategy and leverage targets, as we believe them to contribute materially to shareholder value creation. Over much of the last year, we directed most of our investment capacity to settling the outstanding warrants for cash, which resulted in no share count dilution. With that settlement almost fully behind us, we look forward to turning future investment capacity back toward portfolio growth and share repurchases, which we expect will have a much more positive impact on AFFO per share. With respect to portfolio growth, we will look both domestically and internationally and believe that we will continue to find attractive opportunities that will meet our investment requirements. We are reaffirming our goal of 5% to 10% portfolio growth in 2015, while maintaining our target leverage levels. Over 2% of that growth would come from expected new builds and the rest from acquisitions, of which we have almost another 2% purchased or under contract year to date. Our updated 2015 guidance reflects lower percentage of portfolio growth that includes only those acquisitions we have under contract today. If we are successful in consummating some additional acquisitions, I would expect our 2015 outlook to increase. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and our customers to our success. Our customers are and we think will remain extremely busy with expanding their wireless networks. As a result, our employees are working really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. Our employees do a great job; our customers recognize that; and as a result, we are a preferred provider for our customers network needs. We look forward to continued success as we move through 2015. Linda, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: And we'll begin with the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Great. Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. I guess, two if I may. First, I thought the organic growth information was very helpful in sort of analyzing the company. But given that you had some sort of late-year acquisitions, particularly, I guess the second tranche of Oi towers, I was wondering if you'd give us perspective of like what the constant currency numbers might look like as we think about sort of site leasing expectations for 2015 EBITDA and maybe AFFO? And then the second question is, you've mentioned continuing to invest and maintaining your leverage targets. And I'm wondering if you had a sense that you could share with us as to what sort of investable capacity you have to put to work in 2015? And in that regard, is there any tonal change around the balance of portfolio acquisition and share buybacks as we look into this year? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Let me address the constant currency. I think Jonathan – well, let me make sure I understand what you're looking for. But our guidance for 2015 assumes on a constant currency basis, before iDEN churn, 9% to 10% same-tower cash flow revenue growth.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Got it.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Were you looking for something different than that?
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: I guess I was looking for – yeah, something a little bit different, just because there were some late year acquisitions. So the growth number could be moved up or down, based on sort of the timing of how Brazilian cash flows came into the business in the year. But I can follow up offline.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That latter acquisition only contributed a month's worth of results, and we knew that when we gave our November guidance. So we haven't really seen any change in our expectations around the cash flows there. And really, the movement is all around changes in the real exchange rate.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: All right. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. On the leverage targets, we continue to be very, very comfortable and believe that 7 turns to 7.5 turns net debt leverage is the right place for us to be, particularly in this growth and interest rate environment. Our capacity is going to be around $1 billion of spendable money, maybe a little bit less or a little bit more, depending on what we buy with that and what the EBITDA contribution would be. And in terms of share repurchases, I think the odds are ticking up somewhat that we do share repurchases compared to portfolio growth, only because we do want to stay capitalized the way I've discussed. There are fewer investment opportunities in the U.S. We're going to continue to be very selective around our international growth. And I believe the fallout of all that is there will probably be a greater chance of some additional capacity being left for share repurchases.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Great. Jeff, and in terms of the some of the portfolio acquisitions, in the past, you guys have talked about maybe a theoretical maximum of foreign exposure. Is there still a number out there that we should think about in terms of the balance of domestic and international investments?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We haven't changed that since – I think we gave that out two calls ago, and that was 25% to 30% of revenue would be kind of the limits as we see them today on what we would be targeting for non-U.S. denominated revenues.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI: Thank you for taking the questions.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Couple questions. One of your competitor calls recently, we talked about international growth rates. And it came up, the point about auditing and backfilling and going and looking at some of the carrier transactions, really, in particular. A lot of times, they don't always know what's on their towers. How completely have you guys looked over the different carrier portfolios you've bought internationally? And where are you at in that process at looking at the revenue streams?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are still working on the Brazilian acquisitions, Rick, and will be throughout the rest of 2015. And I would agree with that comment that there are opportunities where you will find revenue in some of these situations. And we have actually been the beneficiary of that already.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Okay. And so that's a process that you're still doing even on the earlier tranches let alone the one that just closed in December.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Also the market, obviously, was quite active this week. What are your thoughts when you talk about what your investment capacity is? When you look at leverage and look at mando converts, is that something that's interesting to you? How do you think about that being a debt or equity quasi instrument?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I haven't thought about it a lot because we don't need to think about it today. I mean if we had a transaction that would take our leverage on a purely debt financed basis above where we wanted to be, which kind of would be a number that we'd be able to get back to our targets within a year. So say, for sake of argument, it's 8.5. And anything above that, we would consider equity, just as we have in many of our past deals. And from what I can tell, the mandatory convert instrument, I know it's been used by both Crown and American, it looks okay.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And the last question. You mentioned I think briefly that FirstNet might be something you could see in 2016. What is the process there? Does anybody have their hands on the wheel there at FirstNet? I know they've got a bunch of money in the bank, but what gives you comfort that there might actually be some activity that start in the towers in 2016?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'm not sure. I hope I didn't convey huge certainty around that. There's definitely the money there. I do think they have some personnel and management and direction issues yet to be worked out. I believe that it continues to be a priority of the current administration to move this forward. So with the money now raised, that's one big stepping stone behind us. But it could happen in 2016. I don't want you to misread my – I don't have any secrets that tell me that it's definitely going to be 2016, other than it looks like the money's now in the bank.
Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Well – and congrats on getting the warrants almost settled. I know that's been a long issue. Good to have that behind you?
Mark DeRussy - Vice President, Finance: Yes, it is. Thanks.
Operator: All right. Next, we'll go to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. Can you talk about the guidance a little bit and what's going on in the U.S.? Lot of strength in the fourth quarter, and it doesn't seem like there was a lot of sort of one-time stuff. So where's that coming from? And there has been a little bit of, I would say, not consistent between some of your compatriots about what AT&T's doing. Are they sort of on, off year-over-year? Can you give us a little bit more visibility into what you're seeing there? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The strong fourth quarter print, Phil, really was driven by the operational activity that preceded it in the second quarter and third quarters. You sign things up; takes a little bit of time before revenue begins to be recognized. So what you saw there was the result of tremendous activity in the year prior to that. AT&T has slowed now, and they slowed down beginning in the fourth quarter. That is the primary reason why we saw the shift in amendments, from amendments to leasing. At least from our perspective, I would agree, with the comments from one of our peers that echoed that, they continue to be off. They're doing things, for sure, but they're off the pace that they were in the first half of last year. And we'll see how that goes the rest of the year. But that slowdown was well known to us at the time we gave our prior guidance, and there's not much that has changed on that front.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then one more, if I can. Talk about small cells; you've gotten more constructive on this over the last couple years. If you had an opportunity to increase your stake in a small cell player, can you help us think about that? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I do have an improving view of small cells. Clearly, the last couple years and current times has demonstrated that it is going to be a permanent part of network architecture going forward. So the volume levels look like they will be there to create constructive business around. We like ExteNet a lot. They're good guys. We think they do very well. And if we had an opportunity to increase our position there, we would certainly consider it.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: All right. Next, we will go to the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And maybe I'll just follow up on the comment about small cells ExteNet. You said you liked the business a lot; it's sort of growing on you. As an owner in that business, do you feel like you've seen enough of the economics to determine whether it potentially can be as attractive as tower leasing economics over the long term? And then, just, I'm curious your thoughts on the FCC's decision yesterday. I'm particularly interested in whether you actually think Title II could affect tower operators in a direct way; not in terms of what your customers do, but whether there is an obligation that would be attached to you?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think on the ExteNet questions, Brett, we are seeing more and more and more evidence over time, given the length of our involvement there. And we do believe that if well executed and well priced that there are projects and networks in that business that can perform to the tower model, which is why we continue to be constructive around that. But the keys are execution and pricing. On the net neutrality thing, I don't really see or think – and no one has suggested that the tower operators are going to have any obligations that come out of this new net neutrality ruling. And if you've got some insight otherwise, let me know. But I don't see it and don't believe that, that will be the case.
Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I don't have any insight on that, so it's good to hear your point of view. But thanks for taking the question.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Great. And next we will go to the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm sorry if I missed this, but I wanted to just get a little clarification. I think you had talked about earlier your expectations for 9% to 10% same-tower cash flow growth, ex- iDEN. You've also mentioned in the past, I think you said you were looking for 7% to 8% whole company core organic revenue growth. Can you just clarify which you were talking about; and if so, update either one or both of those figures for us? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The 9% to 10% was pre-iDEN constant currency. So now from that 9% to 10%, you need to deduct for iDEN and you need to deduct for the changes in the currency that we experienced from one set of guidance to the next. Brendan, do you want to walk to try to walk...
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. So previously, it was 7% to 8%. I mean essentially, that number today, Michael, is 6% to 7%. And that's completely attributable to the changes in the FX rate. So essentially, now you have growth of 6% to 7%, which is the all-in number. It's affected approximately 2% for FX and approximately 1% for iDEN churn. That's the bridge between 6% to 7% and 9% to 10%.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then I guess just one follow-up on the last question with regard to net neutrality. Now with the FCC stating that Title II is going to apply to mobile broadband. I mean have you had any conversations with carriers with regard to – particularly AT&T and Verizon, I mean it's widely expected they're going to file lawsuits. And whether that could impact perhaps any timing with regard to some of their build-outs? Because we've heard a lot of rhetoric coming out of them. And I was just curious if you've had any conversations with them that you could share with us.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. We have not.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: All right. Next, we will go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a couple, if I could. First, just Brendan on the guidance, again – sorry. If I kind of look at the result for site leasing revenue versus the midpoint of the prior guidance, you beat by about $7 million. If I annualize that, I would get $28 million. And net of the $26 million of forex guidance headwind, it seems like the guidance probably still should have gone up. So if you could talk about why that didn't happen. The second question would be just maybe, Jeff, on your comments about the focus in international markets, your selectivity in international markets. Are you making the argument that maybe the prices are moving higher and it's getting more competitive, or there just aren't enough deals out there to do? And then the last thing, if I could, real quick, back to Brendan, would be, you guys have articulated that the way you guide for iDEN is to assume the worst possible scenario, the most revenue going away the soonest it can go away. Could you talk about what your experience was last year relative to that expectation, generally? Thank you.
Brendan T. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. So, David, on your first question about the Q4 beat and how that carries over. We did have a good Q4 that was ahead of what we expected. A lot of that, though, was really about the timing of when those leases were commencing. You heard Jeff mention earlier that a lot of the performance in Q4 was due to what happened in the earlier quarters. That's true. But what we benefited from against our projections was that a number of those leases and amendments started earlier than we had anticipated when setting guidance. So while we did outperform and those are recurring items, those are items that we expected to ultimately kick in anyway. And so you don't necessarily get the full benefit of that carrying over and extrapolated out to the rest of the year. And maybe I'll answer the second one for me before Jeff jumps in on the iDEN piece. We basically ended up about $1 million for the full year better than what we had assumed at the beginning of the year, based on timing of when those leases would terminate. We had essentially the same number of leases terminate that we expected; just the dollar values of those were on average less than what we had projected going into the year. But it was approximately a $1 million benefit throughout the full 2014.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. On the international front, David, there's plenty of opportunities. But we're going to continue to focus on what has been our primary area of focus, which is South America and some of the countries down there that we are not in today. And really, what I mean, we're going to continue to be very, very selective because we have at our disposal the luxury of always turning our capital to stock repurchases, which we know will be a positive result over time. And we have to just measure that. We've done that over the years. It's always seemed to have come out more in favor of portfolio growth. It may continue to come out more in favor of portfolio growth, but the options that we have cause us to really ponder it carefully.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. All right. Appreciate it, guys. Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Next, we will go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. This is Armintas for Simon. I just wanted to touch on the acquisitions that you plan to close in the second quarter for about $266 million. So if you have $1 billion of capacity, is this something that we should be looking for, just a number of smaller deals throughout the course of the year? And also if we get into share repurchases, does this change your target leverage going forward if that becomes a higher mix shift there?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, I'm not sure that what you see under contract today is going to be representative of what comes down the pipe the rest of the year. We just don't know. I mean this happens to be a number of smaller transactions, which we like. That's how we built the company. So if the rest of the year goes that way, we won't be disappointed. And we believe that they'll be plenty to hit the 5% to 10% portfolio growth numbers. And on your second question, the answer depends on how much of our investible capital we actually do direct towards stock repurchases. If it becomes 100%, which I don't ever think it will, that probably would cause us to think about reducing our leverage targets a little bit.
Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just one more to follow up. The AWS auction, now that it's over, you could see some of the carriers sort of sitting around to say before deploying capital to certain areas. Now that they have spectrum in certain markets and decide to build in others; for instance, Verizon getting spectrum in Los Angeles but not New York. Have you seen the conversation change or is it a bit too early there?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Too early.
Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: All right. And next we will go to the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. From my side, just talking about the AT&T. I was wondering what your thoughts are in terms of the longer-term activity levels (41:33) certainly, we've seen sort of a noted, sort of tempering of investment for the carrier. But given what you've seen in terms of activity at other carriers and sort of the competitive landscape as well as the AWS auction do we expect these levels to be sort of the new level set for the carrier? Or is there expectation that at some point in time, some of that spending may have to come back?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We've been doing this for a long time, Amir. We've seen, while over the years, there's always been a strong level of activity, when you dig in by carrier, it's very up and down year-to-year. So what we're seeing here is something we've seen many times over the years. I think AT&T happens to have a lot of different uses for its cash today. And I mean I take great comfort in the fact that they were the high bidder on the AWS-3 auction. That has to be deployed, has to be equipment put on towers to handle that type of new spectrum. So I mean we view this as very temporary.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. And then one follow-up question, if I may. Obviously, we've seen both the other listed companies in the sector sort of pursue restructure. Any sort of update on your thought process if and when that could be something that you folks would be willing to participate in?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Restructure into a REIT?
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Pardon me.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well that's something that we do intend on doing at some point. We think it's in our shareholders' best interests. Today, we're readying ourselves to be able to do that sooner, if we decided to do that, as we watch for any potential changes in the legislative arena. But putting those aside, we're still probably several years away from when we would otherwise elect that status, given the size of our current NOL balances.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks very much for the incremental color.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: All right. And we have a follow-up from Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities LLC: Yeah, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. And I'm sorry if you covered this or – but I want to just get a little bit of your thoughts on, can you share with us some of your revenue growth rates in 2014 and also your outlook, splitting that between international versus domestic, if you could?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Michael. In 2014, our average growth rate throughout the year was approximately 13%, 13.5%, in that range. That's again a gross before churn and before FX growth rate. So in terms of our 2015 guidance, the domestic growth will be approximately 9%, in the same range as the overall. But we would expect the international to be higher at approximately 13%.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the follow-up.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We appreciate everybody joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 12:30 p.m. Eastern today until March 15, 2015 at midnight. You may access the AT&T replay system at any time by dialing 1-800-475-6701 and entering the access code 351210. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. And I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President, Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss in this call is forward looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2014, 2015 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we may make. Our statements are as of today, November 5, 2014, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined by Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and other information required by Regulation G, has been posted to our website, www.sbasite.com. With that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Brendan.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Thanks, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another very strong quarter in all areas. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $349 million or a 21.4% increase over the third quarter of 2013. Domestic cash site leasing revenue increased 12.3% to $283.8 million and international cash site leasing revenue increased 167.1% to $48.8 million. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including our 2 recent acquisitions in Brazil. iDEN-related churn during the quarter had a negative impact of $1.7 million. We continued to experience strong leasing demand, both domestically and internationally. Amendment activity continues to be significant and represented the majority of incremental leasing revenue in the third quarter, reflecting a combination of coverage and capacity-related 4G spending by our customers. The big 4 U.S. carriers contributed over 80% of our consolidated incremental leasing revenues signed up in the quarter. We continued to maintain very healthy leasing backlogs. Tower cash flow for the third quarter of 2014 was $263.8 million or a 24.6% increase over the year-earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 79.3% compared to 78.2% in the year-earlier period. Our services revenues were $44.3 million compared to $44.6 million in the year-earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $10.3 million in the third quarter compared to $9.4 million in the third quarter of 2013. Services segment operating profit margin was 23.3% compared to 21% in the year-earlier period. SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $26.6 million, including noncash compensation charges of $6.3 million. SG&A expenses were $21.8 million in the year-earlier period, including noncash compensation charges of $4.1 million. Increases were primarily attributable to increases in employee-related costs and specifically to headcount increases in Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA was $254.3 million or an increase of 24.9% over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 67.5% in the third quarter of 2014 compared to 64.6% in the year-earlier period. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 29.4% to $173.8 million compared to $134.3 million in the third quarter of 2013. AFFO per share increased 27.9% to $1.33 compared to $1.04 in the third quarter of 2013. AFFO for the third quarter includes a nonrecurring benefit of $7.4 million for coupon interest expense not required to be paid upon conversion of our 4% convertible senior notes. Combined changes in the Brazilian and Canadian exchange rates during the third quarter versus our guidance positively impacted leasing revenue by $400,000 and adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $220,000 each. Net loss during the third quarter was $16.6 million compared to net income of $21.5 million in the year-earlier period. Net income for the third quarter of 2013 was positively impacted by a $6.9 million gain on a mark-to-market of a currency hedge and a gain of approximately $27.3 million on the sale of a bankruptcy claim against Lehman Brothers related to a hedge terminated in 2008. Net loss per share for the third quarter of 2014 was $0.13 compared to net income of $0.17 per share in the year-earlier period. Quarter-end shares outstanding were 129.1 million. In the third quarter, we acquired 94 sites for $79.9 million in cash. SBA also built 114 sites during the third quarter. We ended the quarter with 22,454 sites. 15,099 of these sites are in the U.S. and its territories and 7,355 are in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2014 were $140.5 million, consisting of $8.6 million of nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures, such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx, and $131.9 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the third quarter includes $79.9 million incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, excluding working capital adjustments. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $24.3 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress, and $18.7 million for gross augmentation and tower upgrades. The substantial majority of augmentation CapEx is reimbursable to us by our customers. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $12.4 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of all of our towers and 74% of our domestic towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 33 years. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $7.6 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $500 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.3x. During the quarter, and on October 1, we settled the remaining outstanding principal of our 4% convertible notes for $378 million in cash and 9 million shares of common stock. The settlement was neutral to our share count as the stock portion of the transaction was fully hedged. Also during the quarter, we paid $327 million to early settle 32% of the outstanding warrants that were sold in connection with the issuance of the 4% notes. Subsequent to the third quarter, we had early settled an additional 7% of the warrants for $74.3 million. Pro forma for these settlements, and based on the recent stock prices, our work liability now consists of 5.1 million underlying shares with a value of approximately $340 million. We expect to settle the remaining warrants in cash on or prior to the end of the first quarter of 2015. On July 1, we issued $750 million in principal of senior notes. The notes have a cash coupon of 4.875% that will mature in 2022. The net proceeds from the offering were used to call our outstanding 8.25% senior notes, pay conversion obligations with respect to approximately $121 million aggregate principal amount of our 4% notes and for general corporate purposes. On October 15, we issued 2 tranches of Secured Tower Revenue Securities through our existing SBA Tower Trust, generating a total of $1.54 billion in gross proceeds. The offering had a weighted average coupon of 3.29% and a weighted average maturity of 7 years. Net proceeds from the offering were used to prepay in full $680 million of outstanding Secured Tower Revenue Securities and to repay the $300 million outstanding balance under our revolver, which has been drawn to partially fund the October 1 settlement of our 4% notes, as well as for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and the settlement of a warrants. At the end of the third quarter and pro forma for the October 15 financing, we had $7.7 billion of outstanding debt with a weighted average coupon of 3.9% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.8 years. We currently have no outstanding balance under our $770 million revolver. Based on specified covenants, we have available to us today the full $770 million under the revolver. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the quarter and currently have $150 million remaining on our existing $300 million authorization. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As you have heard, we did have another great quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance across almost all key financial metrics. Once again, we led our industry in many important growth metrics. Our organically leasing activity, which has been particular strong this year and materially ahead of our initial expectations, was once again the primary reason for our outperformance. We are experiencing strong demand across the entire portfolio, both domestic and international. We are seeing the benefits from that demand in both our leasing and services segments. We expect to benefit from continued solid levels of activity for the next several years as carriers build out their initial coverage footprints, to be followed by capacity spending as consumer adoption increases. Our customers have been very clear that network speed and quality is now and will remain a primary focus. There has been much commentary from our customers and peers about the current and expected growth in mobile data use. And much detail has been provided, so I won't repeat that here. I will point out a few product events that I find particularly exciting. The first is the iPhone 6 Plus as well as similar large-screen smartphones. With the larger screens, these devices will facilitate much more mobile video traffic than has previously been the case, putting further demands on networks. Next is Wi-Fi in the car. To provide that service, connection with a cellular network must be maintained. I think this will support additional infrastructure needs nationwide, particularly in less urban markets and highway corridors, where SBA is particularly strong. Third are the upcoming offering of connected watches. While initially touted as communications devices, many say the greater innovation and use will come in health care, where at some point we will all be able to monitor our vital signs real-time and noninvasively. That's all pretty exciting stuff and should certainly help support the need for additional wireless infrastructure going forward. It has been clearly proven over time that wireless data growth in a world of limited spectrum, if service quality is to be maintained, requires more equipment. It really is that simple. The path to better network speed and quality is more infrastructure, and we are seeing the results in our executed new leasing business and backlogs. As a result of anticipated continued strong demand from our U.S. and international customers, we are guiding to strong organic leasing growth again in 2015. In the third quarter, we once again experienced strong leasing demand across the entire portfolio. Same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 14% on a gross basis and 11% on a net-of-churn basis, including iDEN-related churn. The U.S. led on a gross basis, followed closely by Brazil. On a net basis, Brazil led the company because there was no churn to speak of. These same-tower results were well ahead of our expectations and the primary reason for the increase to our 2014 outlook. We attribute our leasing success to a combination of quality assets, strong execution, good contracts and the excellent demand from our customers. In the third quarter, in the U.S., we executed high numbers of both new tenant leases and amendments. Amendment revenue once again made up the substantial majority of incremental leasing revenue in the U.S., approximately 70%. AT&T and Verizon continue to be very busy and represented, once again, the substantial majority of our new business in the quarter. We continue to have contributions from Sprint due to its Network Vision project and also now from the 2.5-gig project. T-Mobile remains active on its 4G upgrade, and T-Mobile activity has been accelerating as we have moved through the year. Our backlogs continue to be healthy. We continue to see strong activity in our international markets. Leasing activity is mostly new leases, but there is a growing amount of amendment activity. We had a big leasing quarter in Brazil. International cash leasing revenue and tower cash flow grew materially year-over-year, once again, primarily due to the portfolio growth. International tower cash flow margins were strong and only slightly behind those in the U.S., reflecting strong execution. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made in Brazil year-to-date and look forward to continuing our positive momentum. Next year, we expect to build materially more towers in Brazil. We continue to finalize leasing relationships with the carriers from which we expect an increase in our new leasing business. The Oi closing remains on track for December 1, and we expect to end the year with approximately 7,000 towers in Brazil, making us the second largest tower company in that market. We continue to follow carefully the potential for consolidation of wireless carriers in Brazil. Should it occur, it may be disruptive short term to the network development activities of those carriers involved. Long term, we believe it will improve the health of the market and lead to greater aggregate network investment. Our services segment produced another quarter of strong results for us in the third quarter, once again with the primary contributors being Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as increased activity levels with Verizon. We expect continued strong services segment contribution for the remainder of 2014 and through 2015. We have increased our services outlook for 2014. Our initial services outlook for 2015 is greater than what our initial 2014 outlook was, although less than our expected 2014 actual results. 2015 outlook for services reflects continued strength, but also some uncertainty as to the magnitude of Sprint's 2.5-gig activity in 2015. Our operational performance across the entire company was very strong in the third quarter. Strong tower cash flow and services margins drove our adjusted EBITDA margin to an industry-leading 67.5%, almost 300 basis points above the year-ago margin. We think to have produced that level of margin while growing materially internationally and increasing SG&A expense to manage that international growth is a real accomplishment. The strong adjusted EBITDA results we had in the third quarter drove our equally strong AFFO and AFFO per share results. As our initial 2015 guidance indicates, we expect another strong year. Our 2015 outlook contemplates between 9% and 10% same-tower cash revenue growth before iDEN terminations, which is the same level we guided to 1 year ago in our initial 2014 outlook but below the 13% gross growth rate we actually expect now for 2014. 2014 has been an unparalleled year for organic leasing activity, well above our expectations a year ago in terms of revenue added per tower. While we anticipate strong leasing activity for years to come, our 2015 guidance reflects a return to levels of growth similar to what we experienced in 2011, 2012 and 2013. On a net basis, our 2015 outlook also contemplates negative impacts of approximately 1% associated with FX rates as compared to rates experienced in 2014, and approximately $16 million to full-year leasing revenue associated with the 2015 iDEN lease terminations, representing a little more than 1% of our projected 2015 cash leasing revenue. 2015 will be our last year of meaningful iDEN churn. Within our 2015 site leasing revenue outlook, we have included non-iDEN churn of approximately 1.5%. This churn rate is within our typical assumed range of 1.0% to 1.5%. Our churn estimate is based on termination notices we have received to-date and an estimate of potential future churn that might impact our 2015 results for which we have not received any notice to-date. The assumed churn includes our estimate of potential terminations that have been or may be received with regard to legacy leases with Metro, Leap and Clearwire. We have had some acquisition-related churn with respect to these tenants since 2013, so we view it in the normal course. With regard to the legacy leases with these 3 tenants, they currently represent approximately $80 million of the company's total annualized cash site leasing revenue. A portion of this revenue was contemplated to churn off during 2015 and is reflected in our outlook. Based on amendments and extensions already received, communications with the parent carriers and our own internal analysis, we believe at least 1/3 of this $80 million will be retained long term. Incremental churn from these 3 carriers may keep our annual churn rate at the high end of our historical 1% to 1.5% range for the next 2 or 3 years. But we don't expect that there will be additional material impact to our future growth rates. We have included no material contribution in 2015 from DISH, Public Safety or any other customer that was not reasonably active in 2014. Please keep in mind that our 2015 outlook reflects site leasing revenue on a GAAP basis, while our tower cash flow adjusted EBITDA and AFFO outlooks are all on a cash basis. Total noncash leasing revenue in 2015 is estimated to be approximately $54.8 million compared to $57.4 million in 2014, a $2.6 million difference. As is our custom, our outlook includes only those towers we own, intend to build or have under agreement to acquire as of today, and we do not guide to any stock repurchases. We expect to end 2014 at the high end of our target range of 7.0 to 7.5 turns net debt annualized adjusted EBITDA, as we continue to settle for cash the warrants related to our retired 4% convertible notes so as to prevent any share dilution. Next year, we intend to continue our historical behavior of investing in either portfolio growth and/or stock repurchases to maintain leverage within our target range. We believe this behavior has created and will continue to create superior value over time. With respect to portfolio growth, we will look both domestically and internationally and believe that we will continue to find attractive opportunities that will meet our investment requirements. We are reaffirming our annual goal of 5% to 10% portfolio growth in 2015 while maintaining our target leverage levels. Our initial 2015 guidance reflects a lower percentage of portfolio growth, reflecting only those acquisitions we have under contract today. And if we are successful in consummating some additional acquisitions, I would expect our initial 2015 outlook to increase. Our initial 2015 guidance reflects a level of discretionary capital investment well below 2014 levels and well below our guided AFFO. We will have significant liquidity that could be deployed for additional asset growth and/or stock repurchases. Based on our estimated 2015 year-end run rate adjusted EBITDA, we could invest approximately an additional $1 billion into portfolio growth and still maintain our target net debt annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage levels. Our access to capital and balance sheet are both in great shape. Our undrawn $770 million revolver and anticipated AFFO generation are more than sufficient to fund pending and plenty of additional investment activity. We have no refinancing obligations prior to 2017. If we pursue additional investments, as is our goal, those would, as necessary, likely be funded with additional debt financing, which is currently readily available to us at attractive rates. Our recently completed $1.54 billion tower revenue securities issue is a great example of our market acceptance. With that offering, we have established a debt structure that compares very comfortably with our peers as to weighted average, rate, tenor and percentage fixed rate, although we choose to operate at materially higher leverage. We intend to continue our balance sheet strategy and leverage targets as we believe them to contribute materially to shareholder value creation. In the aggregate, we believe our initial 2015 outlook is strong, with potential opportunities for improvements throughout the year, just as has happened in 2014. Our focus next year is straightforward: execute well against the favorable macro environment; add quality growth assets; and continue to take advantage, if necessary, of what is expected to be a favorable financing market. We expect to once again produce material growth across a number of key metrics, including growth in AFFO per share. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. Our employees worked really hard to achieve the goals for our customers. Our employees do a great job. Our customers recognize that. And as a result, we are a preferred provider for our customers' network needs. Our customers are and, we think, will remain extremely busy in improving and expanding their wireless networks. We look forward to continued success as we finish this year and move into 2015. Laurie, at this time, we'll take some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Dave Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So thanks for all the detail. I guess I want to make sure, Jeff, I kind of understand the kind of baseline core growth guidance, same-store sales domestically, that you're giving. You're seeing, I think you said 13% gross right now, but you are expecting 9% to 10% next year. But that's before iDEN. If you could just kind of bridge the growth rate we have now realized in the third quarter year-over-year to what you're guiding to and try to boil it down to a same-store sales domestic apples-to-apples core growth rate, that would be super helpful because there's obviously a lot of confusion with what's happening with Clearwire, PCS and Leap. And then I think the second question would be just in terms of AT&T and Verizon being busy. I think Verizon has been quite clear that they continue to plan to spend as much as they can. I think there has been greater questions about AT&T's network development momentum into the second half and into the first part of next year. Are you getting any sense that there is a slowdown there? Or kind of revisiting what their rate of investment is in the network? I'd appreciate it.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Okay, I'm going to let Brendan chime in here and make sure I get this right. But the difference between the 13% and 9% to 10% is basically 3 things: 1% of that is FX; 1% of that is just what happens when you add the same amount of revenue to a tower on a same-tower basis and then you carry that forward to the next year, which some people have called the law of larger numbers, which leaves the 1% to 1.5%. And that last delta is of the amount -- it basically relates to the amount of revenue added per tower that we are forecasting now for 2015 or at least at this point in the year. And those are levels that we were -- that's where we kind of were a year ago, David. And actually, in probably each of the last 3 or 4 years, it was that amount of revenue added per tower. It just so happens that we had a blowout year or are having a blowout year in 2014. And it actually does segue a little bit into your second question. I mean, one of the thoughts behind where we're guiding to right now is we're watching AT&T. There has certainly been widely reported expectations of their slowdown. I have to tell you, we're not seeing much, but we are perhaps seeing a little bit. And then the other part of that will be is we're taking -- we'll enjoy it as it comes, but not get too far out over our skis with respect to the magnitude of Sprint's 2.5G activity. We're kind of waiting to see how that pans out as well. So your 2 questions are related. Does that help?
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Well, it does on the second part for sure. If you could just -- I was just trying to understand, if I take your next year's domestic same-store sales tower growth rate, net of regular churn of 1.5%, net of $16 million iDEN, what is that growth rate that you are starting out looking at?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, first of all, we're talking about company-wide growth rates, and you're trying to reduce it to U.S. But all the comments are around company-wide growth rates, which is why the FX [indiscernible]. That's why I gave that answer. Brendan, go ahead. You take a shot at that.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes. So basically, David, the way that it works is we're saying we're going to have 9% to 10% growth pre-iDEN churn, and that's on a currency-constant basis. So we're in the 7% to 8% range when you back out the FX impact and the iDEN churn. As it compares to the current year, we're basically different for the reasons that Jeff mentioned, which are: the law of large numbers are just -- as we add the same amount, it's a lower percentage year-over-year; plus we are projecting 1% to 1.5% less lease-up. The other difference is basically churn. The 13% is a gross number. The 9% to 10% is net of normal churn. It's not net of iDEN, but it's net of normal churn. So really you're comparing -- 10% to 11% compares to the 13% that we had for this year.
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So 7% to 8% is kind of the core baseline domestic growth rate apples-and-apples for the U.S. market?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: No. No, for the whole company.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: That's for the whole company.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: And that's net of everything.
Operator: And we'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays Capital.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just tailing on those prior questions around the sort of the growth rate expectation, it does seem as though you're taking a much more cautious approach to AT&T and to Sprint at the moment. I'm wondering, clearly, '14 was a stronger growth rate and investment cycle than you had anticipated, what could drive further surprises to the upside when we think about '15 right now, when we're looking at the different initiatives by the different carriers?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, I mean, keep in mind that the growth rates that we're putting forth today are exactly what -- the same ones we've put forth a year ago, and obviously, we were very pleasantly surprised by actual results well ahead of expectations. And what drove that was all 4 carriers having fair amounts of activity and continuing to not only complete coverage, but also begin to densify their networks for capacity. All that can still be there today. The operational needs, we think, are just as strong today as they were then. I think the real issues that we're taking a conservative view on today are budgetary issues with respect to several of our clients as opposed to operational needs, which are every bit as strong as they were this time a year ago, when we were basically guiding to the same type of growth rate.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then if I may, one other sort of area of new spectrum build has, of course, been T-Mobile's 700 megahertz A block. You've mentioned some of the commentary around Sprint. I was wondering if you could provide us a little bit of commentary around where your expectations are for that network build in terms of within your -- the context of your growth rate anticipation.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, we believe Sprint will be very active in certain markets with its 2.5G. But I don't have many -- or much more insight beyond what they've already publicly stated, which is that they're going to focus their initial efforts on certain more urban markets. And really, what we do with Sprint next year will be a function of what the geography is that they tackle on that project.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then -- apologies. On T-Mobile's 700 megahertz A block?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: No, I'm sorry. I thought you were referring to Sprint. No, the T-Mobile actually is, as I mentioned, very active. And it's mostly with A block work, although we are just, I believe, on the cusp of starting more 700-megahertz business. And actually, that is -- we are -- within our guidance, we expect T-Mobile to be stronger; Verizon to continue with strength; and then as I mentioned earlier, a bit of conservatism around AT&T and Sprint. That's how we're viewing the 4 U.S. customers within the context of next year.
Operator: And we'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's Richard for Phil. Just a follow-up on David's question. It looks like you're implying that the U.S. domestic organic growth rate is about 6%. What was it at the beginning of last year when you guided? Was it around this level or a little bit higher? And is that 6% number kind of correct?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: It's a little bit higher than that, closer to 7% for the U.S. And that would be fairly consistent because we had the iDEN -- similar iDEN churn expectations last year as we do this year. So I would say it's basically about the same as it was a year ago.
Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then the other M&A churn is probably taking the place of other churn this year?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Well, our other non-iDEN churn expectations are probably slightly higher going into next year, but not really outside of the range that we typically expect. We usually see 1% to 1.5%. We have, over the last year or 2, probably been closer to 1% in actuality, and we're projecting 1.5% going into next year, but it's not a material difference.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: So that -- as your tallying up the differences, that would be 50 basis points.
Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And a final question, I guess, not looking out too far ahead but for '16 then, as iDEN churn goes away and there is only this churn left, things should get better in '16 on a churn basis?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes.
Operator: And we'll go to Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
Unknown Analyst: This is Will [ph] for Kevin. We were wondering how do you evaluate a share repurchase plan versus M&A opportunities. Specifically, if Verizon were to break up its tower portfolio, would that make it more interesting to you relative to a share repurchase?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, that's a difficult question to ask. I mean, ultimately, whether we're interested in any particular acquisition or not will depend on the price and the terms. And if we find that the price and the terms attractive and we can fund the transaction, stay within our target leverage levels or at least be around that such that we can easily be within them within 1 year, we will be interested in that transaction. Now at the same time, we'll be looking at stock repurchases, depending on where the price of the stock is, and evaluating one versus the other. As we have always stated, and I think our behavior has been consistent, when it's kind of a jump ball, we favor portfolio growth because we think EBITDA growth, when well executed and well priced, is the best way to create additional shareholder value.
Operator: And we go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: This is Armintas for Simon. I was hoping to get more color on the trends in Brazil. Obviously, American Tower had a strong quarter and you seem to be reiterating similar commentary. And also on the portfolio growth, are you considering other markets? I know previously you've said 25% to 30% of total revenue from non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue. So if you were to grow the portfolio instead of share buybacks, would you look at Brazil or some other markets?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, we still are of a mind with the 25% to 30% non-U.S. as a current limitation. Our guidance next year, about 13.5% of revenue would be in Brazil, the only real non-U.S. dollar-denominated country to speak of, so obviously well within that. So Brazil has been good. Activity levels are up. We are watching how the recent elections shake out in terms of where the country's interest rates, inflation rates, pace of investment go. But the needs for Brazil remain tremendously strong in terms of additional infrastructure. The consumers want it. The government wants it. So we remain very bullish in Brazil, and we would continue to look for additional opportunities there. And we'd also look elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere, where we're not today, particularly in South America. And I think that will be our focus for the next year as opposed to anything outside of the Western Hemisphere.
Operator: And we'll go to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Yes, it's Ric. A couple of questions. One, last year, I think you started at $16 million of iDEN churn and I think you heard you say iDEN churn in the quarter was only $1.7 million. So where did iDEN churn -- is it looking like it's going to end up in '14?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: In terms of its total impact on '14?
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: It's going to end up closer to $14.5 million-ish with an expectation for Q4 here.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Sure. Okay. And the expectation for '15, is that $16 million? And again, on those least favorable terms as far as the most expensive sites come off first?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Correct.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And when you look at the rest of the world, Jeff, you'd have to maybe set up more SG&A platforms as you look around the world. How do you kind of think about -- again, it's not this year, as you just mentioned, but how do you think about what regions of the world might be interesting and what would be involved in setting up the platform? And like in Brazil, where you acquired a company that brought in some talent, how long does it kind of take to set up other geographic focuses?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, a key issue would be how you go in: do you go in kind of de novo, where it's going to take a year? We've never actually done that. We've gone in and always had some local existing talent on the ground, where you can really get up and running quite a bit faster. As I think about the world, I think you probably would need -- right now, one of the attractions of South America for us is we can kind of share a lot of SG&A with our -- within our Latin American markets. I think you'd have to break up the rest of the world into at least 3 regions, probably each one deserving of its own mini SG&A group. And that would be Europe, Africa and Asia would be the 3 components. So we haven't gotten anywhere close to doing any of that yet. We have thought about it, of course, some. But I think the real key to answer to your question, Ric, is how you win there.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Sure, makes sense. And maintenance CapEx seems to be going up a little bit as we look at the guidance in 2015 being $30 million to $40 million versus what had been kind of high $20 million range. Is that just that your asset base is getting larger with the growth in the portfolio? Is there something changing on the maintenance side?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, it a mix of a few different things. That's part of it, that we obviously have a lot more assets that need to be maintained. We're doing some work on some of our older assets to make sure that they are kept up, and we expect to anyway. So we've increased it for that. And that nondiscretionary CapEx also includes some general corporate stuff, such as IT projects and other system-related initiatives. So it's kind of a mix of all those things.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Is there some special projects in IT that would cause it maybe to drop back down in '16? Or is this kind of what we should expect on a run rate basis for the long term?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: This is probably towards the higher end of what we would expect on a run rate basis. But of course, the portfolio will continue to grow, we would expect, too. So I would imagine that would offset any less, lesser amount.
Operator: And we'll go to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP: You guys have been growing significantly faster than your public company peers pretty much all year. And your guidance is starkly different than the other company that's given guidance. Could you just talk about, I mean, from your perspective, what is it about your portfolio that grows faster? Is it TowerCo on Mobilitie assets? Or are your sites located in better areas? Any color on how you view your business and why you've achieved superior growth rates would be helpful.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, I think it's a combination of many things. It's the ability to select assets, probably, a little bit better, given some of the very large portfolios some of our peers have bought. A lot of a building has gone on here over the years. So we had the good fortune to create a lot of our assets. And we actually bought from other people like us that were builders for the tower industry. I think we've also -- we've been very faithful to a pricing discipline over the years, where every additional incremental piece of equipment that a customer wants to put on, for the most part, we are able to monetize. And I think the combination of all those things, and plus we execute well, we really do believe that our services business and our services roots make us better operators. I think the combination of all those things adds up to the highest growth rates in the industry.
Operator: I'll turn it back to our speakers now.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Great. Well, we appreciate everyone joining us today. And we look forward to our year-end Q4 call, which should be some time in February. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn it over to your host, Mr. Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks John. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for SBA’s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we'll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2014 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results, and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, July 25, 2014, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G has been posted to our web site, sbasite.com. With that out of the way, I'll turn it over to Brendan to comment on our second quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark, good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another very strong quarter in all areas. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $340.5 million or a 21.8% increase over the second quarter of 2013. Domestic cash site leasing revenue increased 13% to $276.6 million and international cash site leasing revenue increased 171.2% to $48.6 million. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including our two recent acquisitions in Brazil. iDEN-related churn during the quarter had a negative impact of $1.7 million. We continued to experience strong leasing demand both domestically and internationally. Amendment activity continues to be significant and represented the substantial majority of incremental leasing revenue in the second quarter, reflecting a combination of coverage and capacity related 4G spending by our customers. The big four U.S. carriers contributed 90% of our consolidated incremental leasing revenue in the quarter. We continue to maintain leasing backlogs record levels. Tower cash flow for the second quarter of 2014 was $259 million or a 27% increase over the year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 79.6% compared to 77.6% in the year earlier period. Our services revenues were $43 million compared to $44.8 million in the year earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $10.9 million in the second quarter, compared to $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2013. Services segment operating profit margin was 25.4%, compared to 19.8% in the year earlier period. SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $25.4 million, including non-cash compensation charges of $6.1 million. SG&A expenses were $21.5 million in the year earlier period, including non-cash compensation charges of $4.9 million. Increases were primarily attributable to increases in employee related costs and specifically to headcount increases in Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA was $251.1 million or an increase of 27.8% over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.2% in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 63.9% in the year earlier period. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 31.8% to $70.6 million, compared to $129.5 million in the second quarter of 2013. AFFO per share increased 31% to $1.31 compared to $1 in the second quarter of 2013. Combined changes in the Brazilian and Canadian exchange rates during the second quarter versus our guidance, positively impacted leasing revenue by $1.3 million and adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by approximately $700,000each. Net loss during the second quarter was $9.5 million compared to a net loss of $35.9 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the second quarter was $0.07 compared to a net loss of $0.28 per share in the year earlier period. Quarter end shares outstanding were 129.1 million. In the second quarter, we acquired 45 sites for $28.5 million in cash. SBA also built 51 sites during the second quarter. We ended the quarter with 22,305 sites. 15,038 of these sites are in the U.S. and its territories and 7,267 are in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2014 were $79.1 million, consisting of $6.7 million of nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures, such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $72.4 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the second quarter includes $28.5 million incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, excluding working capital adjustments and paid earn-outs. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $17.4 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress and $12.4 million for gross augmentations and tower upgrades. The substantial majority of augmentation CapEx is reimbursable to us by our customers. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $13.3 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial, and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years, the land underneath approximately 72% of all of our towers and 74% of our domestic towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 31 years. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the first quarter with $6.9 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $149.9 million. Our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.7 times. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA and net cash interest expense, was 3.5 times. During the quarter, we settled the early conversion of $121.5 million in principal of our 4% convertible notes for $121.5 million in cash, and 2.7 million shares of common stock. The settlement was mutual to our share count, as a stock portion of the transaction was hedged. We expect to settle an additional 11 million principle of the 4% convertible notes in the third quarter, with the remaining 367 million in principle, maturing on October 1 of this year. Also during the quarter, we paid $276.2 million to early settled, 30% of the outstanding warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the 4% notes, which are scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2015. Subsequent to the quarter, we paid $66.7 million to early settle an additional 7.5% of the warrants.  Pro forma for these two transactions and based on recent stock prices, our warrant liability consisted 10.3 million underlying shares with a value of approximately $605 million. We expect to settle this obligation in cash. On July 1, we issued $750 million principal of new senior notes. The notes have a cash coupon of 4.875% and will mature in 2022. The net proceeds from the offering will be used to settle the principal amount related to the early conversion of our 4% convertible notes, to call our outstanding 8.25% senior notes and for general corporate purposes. At the end of the second quarter, and pro forma for this financing, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 4.1% and our weighted average maturity is approximately five years. We currently have no outstanding balance under our $770 million revolver. Based on specified covenants, we have available to us today, $720 million under that revolver. We did not purchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter, and currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. As you have heard, we had another excellent quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance across all key financial metrics. Once again, we expect to lead our industry in many important growth and margin metrics. Our organic leasing activity was strong again in the second quarter, and a prime reason for our outperformance. Based on our year-to-date activity, current backlogs and pending portfolio growth, we are once again announcing meaningful increases to our 2014 outlook. In the U.S., we expect to benefit from elevated levels of customer activity for the next several years, as carriers build out their initial 4G coverage footprints, to be followed by capacity spending, as consumer adoption increases. Scheduled spectrum auctions in a number of our markets, will add additional spectrum resources to our customers, which in turn come with build out requirements and will necessitate additional infrastructure needs that we expect will be a source of additional customer demand for years to come. In the second quarter, we once again experienced strong leasing demand across our entire portfolio, both domestic and international. Same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 12.7% on a gross basis, and 10.2% on a net of churn basis, including iDEN related churn. This is higher than our expectations, and one reason for the increase to our outlook. We attribute our leasing success to a combination of quality assets, strong execution, good contracts, and excellent demand from our customers. Strong execution was particularly evident with tower cash flow margins up 200 basis points over the year earlier period. In the second quarter, in the U.S., we executed high numbers of both new tenant leases and amendments. Amendment revenue once again made up the substantial majority of incremental leasing revenue in the U.S. Amendments are for both coverage and capacity, and many amendments represent the first or second equipment change or addition, after the initial 4G deployment. Our customers continue to request larger equipment loads for both leases and amendments, which has a favorable impact on rate. AT&T and Verizon continue to be very busy, and represented a substantial majority of our new business in the quarter. We saw another quarter of material contribution from Sprint, due to its network vision project, and T-Mobile remains active on its 4G upgrade. The contributions from both Sprint and T-Mobile continue to come mostly in the form of amendments, with the level of activity form T-Mobile in particular, up substantially compared to the last two quarters, although still well back of AT&T and Verizon levels of activity. Our backlogs remain large and continue to replenish. Based on current activity, we have included a small leasing benefit from Sprint 2.5G in our 2014 outlook, but nothing yet from the T-Mobile 700-MHZ business. We have included no contribution on our 2014 outlook from any prospective customer that is not currently reasonably active, so that would exclude Dish and public safety. Please keep in mind, that our 2014 outlook reflects site leasing revenue on a GAAP basis, while our tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO outlooks are all on a cash basis. Our services segment produced strong results again for us in the second quarter, with all four major U.S. carriers contributing. We executed extremely well, producing a record services margin. Our services backlog remains high, we expect continued strong services segment contribution through 2014, and have raised the midpoint of our full year services outlook by $20 million to reflect those expectations and our second quarter outperformance. We continue to see strong activity in our international markets in both organic leasing and portfolio growth. Internationally, we are seeing strong growth in new sale sites, with a lot of basic 3G coverage build still ongoing in our markets, and a small but increasing amount of 4G coverage builds. International leasing activity is mostly new leases, but there is a growing amount of amendment activity. International cash leasing revenue and tower cash flow growth grew materially year-over-year, once again, primarily due to portfolio growth. International tower cash flow margins were strong, and only slightly behind those in the U.S., reflecting strong execution. Our operational performance across the entire company was very strong in the second quarter. Strong tower cash flow and services margin drove our adjusted EBITDA margin to an industry leading 68.2%, another record for SBA, topping our first quarter results. We think to have produced that level of margin, while growing materially internationally and increasing SG&A expense to manage that international growth, is a real accomplishment. The strong adjusted EBITDA results we had in the second quarter drove our equally strong AFFO sand AFFO per share results. We announced an acquisition from Oi, of an additional 1,641 sites, which is expected to close in December of this year. Our thinking behind that acquisition is as follows; this is a great deal for us. It was exclusively negotiated, given our strong relationship with Oi. These are high growth wireless sites, purchased at a lower multiple and price per site, than the acquisition we closed with Oi at the end of the last quarter. Given our positive history with Oi, we expect the integration of these sites to go very smoothly. While our motivation here was primarily financial, there was also a strategic rationale behind the acquisition. We continue to be very optimistic about the Brazil market long term. There is a large and likely, never to be repeated number of communication sites available for purchase this year in Brazil. We wanted to participate in those opportunities, at least to the degree necessary to secure our position in Brazil, as a substantial tower operator long term, similar to the position we have built in the United States. With the closing of the Oi transaction by year end, we will own approximately 7,000 sites in Brazil, which we believe will secure that position. With our long term position believed secure, we expect our focus in Brazil for at least the remainder of this year will be organic growth and new site builds, perhaps with some smaller tuck-in acquisition similar to our historic mom and pop activity in the U.S., should those opportunities arise. I am very pleased with the progress we have made in Brazil year-to-date and we look forward to continuing our positive momentum. We continue to finalize leasing agreements with carriers, from which we expect an increase in our new leasing business in Brazil. Higher expectations around our Brazil business, due in part to stronger than expected second quarter results, are one of the drivers to our increased 2014 outlook. We continue to perfect and fine tune our thinking on the potential scope and size of our international activities. We are convinced that international expansion, if well executed will create substantial value for our shareholders long term. Currently, we believe the most value will be created, if we continue to source the financing for our international activities in the U.S. debt markets, denominated in U.S. dollars. We believe the local financing options in the international markets that we are interested in are currently too expensive relative to the U.S. markets, even after factoring in the foreign exchange benefits of matching some expenses to revenue, in local currency. With such an approach, managing the amount of our U.S. dollar denominated EBITDA, relative to our U.S. denominated debt, becomes a primary risk control and focus. Managing these items involves limiting our non-U.S. dollar activities, reducing leverage, and/or obtaining financing denominated in local currencies. Because I believe our balance sheet management and leverage has been a critical driver of our shareholder value creation, particularly in these accommodative debt markets, our current thinking is to limit our non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue into approximately 25% to 30% of total revenue. There are a number of variables that of course go into that outcome, some of which change everyday, so this will be a constant area of analysis and adjustment for us. I believe we are years away from approaching those limits, based on our current assessment of the international activities that interest us. Based on the midpoint of our 2014 full year outlook for total revenue, this year we expect non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue to comprise approximately 11.5% of the total, growing to approximately 15% in 2015 as we see full year contribution from our 2014 acquisitions. The practical impact of limiting our non-U.S. dollar denominated activities, is that long term, if we are to continue to maintain our target leverage as is our current goal, we will have material amounts of capital, which we would look to invest in U.S. dollar denominated investments or stock repurchases. With respect to portfolio growth, long term, we will continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities, certainly in our existing markets, and potentially some new markets. Although our preference currently is to stay in the western hemisphere. Our 2014 guidance reflects only those acquisitions we have under contract today, and if we are successful in consummating some additional acquisitions, our 2014 outlook could increase. Shorter term, our focus is to satisfy our obligations under our 4.0% convertible notes and the related warrants for cash, including consummating an additional financing, as set forth in our outlook. We expect to be substantially complete with that task by year end, and end the year with leverage around the high end of our 7.0, 7.5 times target range. Financing markets continue to be very accommodative, and we expect the contemplated financing to occur in the secured debt markets at very favorable rates. We are very pleased with our recent $750 million high yield offering, a market which we knew we needed to access by year end, once we agree to the acquisition of the additional 1,641 sites from Oi, although neither of which were contemplated in our last outlook. We chose to go into the high yield market earlier, given the strength of the market at that time, and we are glad we did. As our guidance indicates, we expect the current strength at our business to continue through 2014. Our focus remains the same; execute well against the favorable macro environment, add quality growth assets, and continue to take advantage of what is expected to remain a favorable financing market. With an annual portfolio of growth goal already achieved, leverage within our target range and tremendous liquidity, we look forward to continuing to realize strong revenue and tower cash flow growth on our high quality assets. We believe we have SBA ideally positioned for future success. We expect to once again produce material growth across a number of key metrics, including growth in AFFO per share. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. Our operational results were very strong in the second quarter, continuing the strong results that we have been producing since the beginning of the year. Those results come from the efforts of many, and I thank all those, who contributed to our second quarter success. We look forward to reporting continued success, as we move through 2014. Shawn, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question is going to come from the line of Ric Prentiss. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Jeff Stoops: Good morning.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Couple of questions; first on organic growth. Obviously 10.2% net same tower revenue growth pretty strong. What's implied in your 2014 guidance midpoint, as far as what that organic, kind of same tower revenue growth rate would be?
Brendan Cavanagh: Ric, it currently implies approximately a 10% growth rate, which is actually an increase from where we were previously. We have been a little bit higher than that in the first half of the year. We actually did take up our expectations around organic growth for the second half of the year, from where they were previously. Although, we do not have them at the same level that we actually experienced during the first half. So you can kind of think about it as close to 10.5% in the first half of the year-to-date, and closer to 9.5% for the second half of the year, blending to approximately 10%.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, we have been inching it up, Ric, as we move through the year, given the outperformance. But we are -- because we have outperformed really so much in the first half, we are just a little hesitant to go to that same level, although there is nothing that we see, and no reason why we couldn't potentially do that again.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Little bit of conservatism, just to be safe in the year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. And I mean, I think the focus is we have been moving up the base assumption all year long.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Right. And then on the organic side also, I think both you guys mentioned that amendment activity in the revenue term was more significant than new co-los. Is there some kind of percent you can kind of throw to us there, as far as amendment leasing revenue, from amendment versus new co-los?
Jeff Stoops: It's about 75-25 for us in the quarter.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Okay. And then on external growth, Jeff, I think you hit pretty strong about where you want to keep your non-U.S. dollar denominated to grow to. When you think about portfolio growth historically 5% to 10% kind of targets; at what point, does stock buyback become more interesting, or how do you guys kind of, everyday kind of look at that? Do I buy my own stock, do I keep buying assets?
Jeff Stoops: Asset growth has always been, Ric, our top priority, and I think it will continue to be our top priority, now with the few bands around it, based on the targets and the thinking that we outlined. We will always also consider stock repurchases, if the relative value appears attractive; because we are in the midst of cleaning up the converts, and settling the converts and the warrants this year -- people shouldn't really expect, it would kind of be counterproductive to that process to be in the market, buying our stock this year. But I do expect, we will be taking a strong look at allocating capital in that direction in years to come, and it will be a question of, do we find better acquisition opportunities. I mean, the one constant that I believe right now, and you kind of run your models off this is that, we do believe that the 7 to 7.5 times target leverage level is the right spot for us to operate in. That will throw off certain amounts of additional investment opportunity, which will either go towards growth or stock repurchases.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Makes great sense. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Amir Rozwadowski. Please go ahead.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Thank you very much and good morning folks.
Jeff Stoops: Good morning.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays: We have gotten some great color in terms of some the carrier initiatives you folks have mentioned. I did want to ask, if we are looking at some of the larger carriers that we have seen already report results, it does seem as though, there is a bit of a front-end loaded element to their CapEx outlook for the year. Now I realize, that there is a bit of a nuance, when it comes to translating their CapEx outlook versus the visibility that you folks have in your business. But just trying to [indiscernible] here, I mean, how much should we think about the visibility that you folks have, in terms of overall capacity spending, for not just the duration of 2014, but also going into 2015?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, we have never had perfect visibility of course Amir, because only a fraction of what the carriers report as CapEx actually goes on the towers. So I don't know that we can -- you should not take what we say as a 100% correlated indicator of what our customers are going to be doing; but I will tell you that, obviously, we are familiar with the reports and the statements of our customers. We really don't see any material change in activity levels, and obviously we don't, because we guided I think so strongly going forward. If anything, there might be a slight pull back on some new leases versus amendment activity, but the amendment activity is really a race to finish certain levels of 4G networks, we don't see that slowing down at all. So I think people should look at our guidance and say, its really not going to affect SBA.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays: That's very helpful. And then if I may, you've mentioned that you've included a small amount of that Sprint's 2.5 GHZ go into your outlook, and nothing on the 700 MHZ [indiscernible] In terms of the discussions with carriers though, I mean, where do you think in terms of timing and potential scope of those types of investments? I mean, it just seems as though, both new spectrum pieces are strategically important to those carriers. So I am just wondering, how to think about sort of the opportunity set that could present itself, once you start including that into your outlook?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well that will be primarily a good conversation for next quarter, when we roll out our 2015 outlook, which is where we would expect much more material contributions from those two items.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Great. Well thank you very much for the incremental color.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of David Barden. Please go ahead.
David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Good quarter. Maybe two if I could, maybe Brendan, I think you called out that December month, that you're planning on closing the Oi transaction being accretive to guidance, and you could kind of give us a little color as to how much that added and kind of your comfort level that December is a meetable target for closing that? And then second, maybe Jeff, there is some conversation out there about how important the AWS-3 auction is really going to be for the tower companies, because its more likely than not going to be able to be broadcast through existing antennas. But I know that you guys have had contract structures, that very specifically call out the spectrum bands as well, as opportunities to monetize the relationship with the carriers. So if you could elaborate a little bit of how you see the AWS-3 auction impact you guys or the business, it would be helpful color. Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: David, first on the Oi deal; we have included the assumption that it will close December 1st for purposes of our guidance. We have excluded that, because we do think that that's the most likely closing date, so that's why we put it in there. So I think at this point as we sit here today, the odds are very good, that's when it will close. The impact to our guidance was approximately $4 million of incremental leasing revenue added, and closer to $2.5 million to $3 million on the TCF line.
Jeff Stoops: On the AWS-3 auctions, David, we really do not have spectrum specific charges that we would ask our customers to pay in the absence of new or changed equipment, and that has been our operating philosophy for years, it’s the one that's appreciated and understood by our customers. So what will happen or what will need to happen, and I don't have the actual specs yet of what the deployments will look like, is if the AWS-3 spectrum deployments involve new or changed equipment, we will have an opportunity to increase our leasing revenue from that, and if they don't involve those things, we will not [ph].
David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, that's clear. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question then will come from the line of Jon Schildkraut. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Couple if I may, first I was wondering if you could give us a perspective of how much investable capacity you have left? I think that it was about $1 billion you were highlighting out at PCIA, and then its really good color in terms of the organic growth rates that you provided. Could you give us a breakdown of what it looked like your U.S. assets and internationally, and then specifically on the U.S., any incremental color about how tower co and mobility assets are doing would be appreciated? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the capacity, we have announced Oi, so that's over $500 million, and we are going to direct probably the rest of our capacity this year, Jonathan, towards cleaning up the warrants for cash. So folks should not really look for a lot of material acquisition from us, there will be some mom and pop stuff as we move through the year. But we will look to have a clean start with our capital deployments and our capacity in 2015, and we will be able to give you some more color on that next quarter when we rollout full year guidance. In terms of the growth rates, we are not going to get too granular, go country-by-country, but I will tell you that Brazil and the U.S. were higher than the 12.7 company-wide and Central America and Canada were lower.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners: Thank you. That's helpful. And tower co, mobility?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, they continue to do well and perform ahead of plan. They continue to attract less amendments, but more than their disproportionate share of new leases.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners: Great. And I did notice that you took up your new builds slightly versus last quarter's expectation. Was that around deploying a little bit more new sites down in some of your international markets, or are you looking to do new builds in the U.S. as well?
Brendan Cavanagh: That's really around Brazil and is the flow-through effect of some large build-to-suites that we have been awarded, that I think we talked about last quarter.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick. Please go ahead.
Phil Cusick - JP Morgan: Hey guys, can you hear me?
Jeff Stoops: Sure Phil.
Phil Cusick - JP Morgan: Thanks. So just a couple of things; one, can you help us think about how much of your AFFO is coming from the services business this year, based on the guidance? And then second, Jeff, can you expand on your sort of maximum 25% to 30% of revenue from international went into that? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: You can only take -- the services piece, Phil, it's approximately $38 million of AFFO is implied in our guidance, for full year AFFO. On the latter, Phil, it has been a culmination of a lot of intense analysis and modeling, and basically gets down to this, as long as there continues to be such a wide discrepancy in economics between borrowing in the U.S. and borrowing in the forward markets, we are going to stick to the U.S. funding sources.
Jeff Stoops: So with that as your base, you have to manage then to repay that in U.S. dollars. So we kind of triangulate around leverage in U.S. dollars, we triangulate around cash interest coverage ratio in U.S. dollars. We use as kind of baseline, the fact that we want to stay in the 7 to 7.5 times leverage range, and then all of those things, we have certain goals and targets, that is what produced the 25% to 30% non-U.S. dollar denominated international target. We are very pleased with the kind of the thoughtful approach we have taken here, and I am pleased to be able to kind of enunciate it to our investors really, pretty clearly, and it has been something that we have been thinking a lot about all year long.
Phil Cusick - JP Morgan: Good. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Jeff, you touched on public safety, saying that you were not including anything in 2014. But obviously, with AWS-3 coming up, the funding is starting to come in too, better relief. Have you had any more kind of color into when you might start to see some activity, and going to maybe get some benefit in 2015, or is it still out a little bit beyond that? And if you could just touch on small cells and ExteNet, what are you seeing in terms of demand from carriers, and how are you thinking about that opportunity? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: To be honest with you, Simon, I haven't really dug in to the degree that we will, by the time we give our 2015 guidance, as to what the timing will be, with public safety, I don't know. I can't say yet, how much activity, if any, we will see in 2015. But stay tuned to that. Remind me to answer that question next time around. On ExteNet, they are staying very busy; volumes of small cells clearly are up from where they have been over the last couple of years. We think they are doing a good job. We are happy to be a part of it, and we will see where the future takes that relationship. But we are pleased with the way things are going.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen: Okay, thank you. Two questions, one modeling, as it relates to the converts. So the converts on the balance sheet as of the second quarter were still $370 million. Can you just walk us through, what the anticipated cash premium that you expect to pay for what remains on the balance sheet, so we'd start thinking about our models in terms of reducing the cash portion, obviously taking out the 370, but then what other remaining cash portions should we be subtracting out of our cash balance? And then also, what the implied total share count should be, exiting the year? Obviously, it has bounced around a little bit, in terms of how it's reported on a GAAP basis. Just wanted to make sure I had the right total share count assumed, based on what's happening with the converts, as we exit the year. And then, my other question just has to deal with network services segment of the business; can you just remind us what the historical correlation has been to the site rental business, and whether that's historically proving to be a leading indicator of any type of demand going forward? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Colby, this is Brendan. On the converts, as of the end of the second quarter, you're right, it was about $379 million of principal that was left, and that will mature on October 1st, and we will settle that, at that time. There is a -- when you talk about the premium associated with it, we are fully hedged against the premium, so the actual timing of sort of experiencing that premium and paying off the principal, are not necessarily in-sync, because the premium for us is basically satisfied through settling the warrants that were sold at the time that we issued the convert. We have begun unwinding some of those warrants already, and as was mentioned in the release, we through -- into the third quarter here, have already unwound 37.5% of the warrants. So basically what this means is that, at October 1st, we will settle the remainder of the principal, $379 million, there will be no impact on the share count. We have guided to doing additional financing to clean up the rest of the warrants, so throughout the rest of the year, by the end of the year, our guidance contemplates settling all of the remaining warrants for cash, and excluding what we have already settled and announced that, based on yesterday's stock price, would be valued at approximately $605 million.
Jeff Stoops: On your network services question Colby, if you were able, not sure it's possible, but if you were able to gather all the networks services business revenue and then look at it, it would be a good indicator of future leasing activity. In our case however, while you should expect from our guidance that we do expect strong leasing activity. Our network services business actually has a much different mix, than where we happen to be enjoying most of our incremental leasing revenue. For example, the Sprint 2.5G project is a big contributor to our services business, but not nearly to the same degree to our incremental leasing revenue. So in general as a whole, it is a correlator, but if you actually get very granular and look at our business, where it's coming from versus our leasing business, it's actually pretty different, which I think is a good sign, it shows that everybody is busy doing something.
Colby Synesael - Cowen: Great, thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Then Colby, on the share count, you asked I think an assumption of approximately 130 million, maybe slightly less than that at year end is reasonable. Shouldn't be really any different, materially different than where we are today, because the converts are not anticipated to have any impact on that.
Colby Synesael - Cowen: The only other incremental increase this year, that is typical comp etcetera?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, there would be minor things like that, exercise of stock options or something.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, our plan and our expectation and goal all along here has been to cash settle these warrants, so our share count would not increase, which is why we are devoting a lot of our otherwise investable capital for the back half of the year, into settling the warrants.
Colby Synesael - Cowen: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question then will come from the line of Jonathan Atkin. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us a review on how the tower industry in Mexico might evolve, given some of the divestitures that may happen in that market? And then domestically, you've given the stats for land ownership or under control, 74%. What would be the pure ownership stats for your U.S. towers?
Jeff Stoops: That's probably about 30% Jonathan. On Mexico, we are watching it with lot of interest. We have chosen historically to not enter Mexico up until this time, in part, based on the concentration of carriers there. So this could change all that. But just this week, some statements were made by America Movil, that we are looking to spin out and operate independently, the towers. So that would be very interesting, because if that happens, all of the sudden, you will have a very big dominant player down there, that will be -- I am sure, a strong competitor going forward. So we have to take all that into consideration.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Great. And then one last question on the guidance; you are excluding T-Mobile 700, but I think you said in your script, that you are actually seeing some activity there. So is it just conservatism, that explains why it wouldn't be in the guidance, or it does not have any --
Jeff Stoops: The amendment activity in the business that we are seeing from T-Mobile is not 700 yet. Its metro change-outs, its some other things, but its not 700 megahertz.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Joe Scavone [ph]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jeff, last quarter, you had mentioned that you had stepped up the work on the reconversion. Can you just give us a sense of how quickly you could convert, if you felt the timing was better to do it sooner rather than later, and then with the work that you have done, do you have an updated timeline that you could share with us?
Jeff Stoops: I am going to let Brendan handle that.
Brendan Cavanagh: We have been doing some work around it, just to make sure that we have all of our facts ready, so that we would have the flexibility to go, whenever we feel its appropriate. We could conceivably, if we wanted to, we think we could conceivably convert effective next year, January 1. But at this point, we don't necessarily see the need to do it at that time, but we will continue to evaluate it, and remain flexible and available to do it, when the time seems right.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, we are doing work Joe around our E&P position. We have concluded, we are still years away from positivity which would be one catalyst to convert. So really our focus will remain watching the political landscape, and seeing if there is any real chance that the laws get changed. Our current thinking and the advice from a lot of folks is that, that is not going to happen. But that's something we monitor very closely.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question then will come from the line of Michael Bowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest: Okay. Good morning. Thank you very much. Couple of questions. I think last quarter, you had mentioned that the international growth rates, the core growth was a little bit less. I am sorry if I missed it, but I wanted to see if you could give us an update on that this quarter. And then secondly, can you help us think a little bit through the reasons why your amendment driven revenue will be a higher percentage of your revenue growth, than say, your other two competitors, and how we should think about that going forward? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: We picked up a quarter, this quarter, and dropped off a quarter that we had last quarter in Brazil. The only towers that we have owned down there, that go into the calculation, are our Vivo 800 towers, because those are the only ones we have owned for a full year. And the timing is such, that we just picked up a lot of business, which turned that -- those towers and that metric from a lagger to a leader, and that's why it happened. And in terms of the -- I really don't want to get in comparisons with our peers. We are seeing a tremendous amount of activity. For us its 75% amendments that we are enjoying and our revenue recognition. It’s a busy time out there, and as you could see from our guidance, we expect to continue the strength through the rest of the year.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest: Just to follow-up on that, do you think that as we move into 2015, that that 75% comes down more to maybe a 50-50 level, or how should we think about it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well we will see how the AWS turns out, and what that means. That could be a whole new flurry of amendments. We think that the 2.5G in the 700 megahertz business will all come, mostly in the form initially of amendments. We think that there is still a lot left to do by AT&T and Verizon. So while I'd be hesitant to say, it will be the same high rate, all through 2015, and looks like it will be in 2014. I think its going to be pretty strong.
Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest: All right. Thank you very much guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question then comes from the line of Mike McCormack. Please go ahead.
Mike McCormack - Nomura: Yeah, hi guys, thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on what you're seeing out there with respect to Wi-Fi adoption on your carriers. How many carriers are actually embracing it, and then thinking about some of the stuff that people are talking about with Comcast. Is cable at some point -- maybe excited to deploy the macro network, with some sort of Wi-Fi technology? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: I guess its possible Mike. I have not seen or heard of any concrete plans for cable companies to deploy macro sites. I think of seeing the same thing you are, which is a lot of talk around Wi-Fi in the home or in the -- around the urban markets. Wi-Fi, whether its deployed by the cable companies or by anyone, wi-fi has been around for a while. It is a fixed location solution. It is not a mobility solution. So we continue to see it as part of the growing infrastructure of wireless, helps people kind of continue to get hooked on video and things like that. But its not something, that has in any way, impacted our business and I don't think it will.
Mike McCormack - Nomura: Jeff, just made another clarification on your M&A strategy, you mentioned western hemisphere obviously, but what is it about the eastern hemisphere that you don't think is appropriate for SBA?
Jeff Stoops: I will speak generically by region. Europe, we are not sure that the growth for the price to be paid there, based on the deals that we have looked at, is our cup of tea. Africa is an interesting market, but its still very much in development, we are watching it. But Africa adds that whole new element of operational challenge, that is not present in the western hemisphere, which is power. Lot of the African tower business is about the provision of power. So we find that different. And in, you can't really go to China, because of the way the laws work there for real estate owned companies. And in India, we have looked and we have been there, and we just -- again that is not our cup of tea. We do -- we have clearly experienced the strategic value of staying in the western hemisphere, because of where we are located in South Florida. We have a huge pool of resources that we can pull on, to deal with the Latin cultures, and the various countries. We have people now employed at SBA, that come from every single country in Central and South America, and our travel ability from here is also -- makes it much easier to operate. So that's our current thinking.
Mike McCormack - Nomura: Great. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We have a question from the line of Kevin Smithen. Please go ahead.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie: Thanks. Jeff, you have had some very nice improvements in tower cash flow margins. Can you give some more details on operational achievements in Brazil, and your confidence level in that business? I know you have kind of felt that you had a sort of a learning process there, where are you in that learning process, and are some of the PCS leverage we saw this quarter, how much of that came from Brazil?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, a fair amount came from Brazil, Kevin. We continue to move up our progress curve, quite rapidly, I am pleased to say. And that is an area, where we are bringing a lot of U.S. learned experience in terms of operating efficiencies, to a market that didn't really think or pursue that before. So that has been, and I think, will continue to be a good source of margin expansion for us. The other thing about margins, and we have some of this in the U.S. with our mobility assets, but for the most part, all of our Brazil assets, the margins are actually even higher. But the way GAAP makes you account for ground leases, when they are reimbursed to you by the carrier, is you have to expense them yourself, and the you gross-up the revenue, which is obviously because its required by GAAP, how we do it. But our true economic margins are actually much higher.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie: As you look to 2015, do you feel that you have the right portfolio of assets in Brazil? Or there are potentially more deals you could do there? And obviously, given your comments about regional expansion, it seems like if there is no more deals in Brazil and the U.S. that share repurchase might be more -- might be higher up on your capital allocation list, relative to the last few years?
Jeff Stoops: If in fact that's the way the portfolio opportunities play out, that would be true, because we do intend to stay capitalized at 7 to 7.5 times range. I do think there will be additional growth opportunities in Brazil. I think there will be some opportunities in other countries in South America that we are not currently in. So I think, folks should expect a mix of those capital allocations in the future, but our bias will be continued portfolio of growth, in markets we want to be in, but we are not going to just grow the portfolio, obviously for the sake of growing the portfolio, to the exclusion of stock repurchases, which we think, if well executed against our high quality assets, will be a good source of shareholder value creation for years to come.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Kurn. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Okay Shawn. This will need to be our last question.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research: Thanks guys. Just to circle back to the tower cash flow margins. It looks like in the U.S., your domestic costs actually declined year-over-year? I was wondering what drove that decline, and is this the trend that you think, you can manage going forward?
Brendan Cavanagh: I am sorry Spencer, can you repeat what declined year-over-year?
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research: Your cash leasing costs, in the U.S.?
Brendan Cavanagh: I think there is a couple of things where we had some benefits during this quarter. We had significant outperformance in the area of property taxes for one, and as well as maintenance costs. Some of them were just good timing, but we've also had an active program of challenging property taxes and trying to reduce those costs, so some of it would be associated with that --
Jeff Stoops: And buying our land.
Brendan Cavanagh: And of course, that's a good -- we are also obviously active in buying our own land, or doing long term pre-paid easement. So that's reducing the [indiscernible] expense.
Jeff Stoops: I doubt, Spencer, and this is a preview of the 2015 guidance. I doubt we are going to project that we are able to continue to reduce that cost line in absolute dollars. I think, we certainly would expect to continue to project margin expansion. But not sure, we will be able to actually reduce absolute dollars going forward.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research: Got it. Thanks so much.
Jeff Stoops: Sure. Okay, well that is all for this quarter. We appreciate everyone's attention, and we look forward to our next results.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for SBA’s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we'll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2014 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others that affected historical results may affect future results, and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, May 2, 2014, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted to our website, sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Brendan.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night we had another very strong quarter in all areas. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance for leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $309.3 million or a 13.1% increase over the first quarter of 2013. Domestic cash site leasing revenue increased 12.8% to $268.7 million and international cash site leasing revenue increased 67.2% to $29.6 million. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including our acquisition of 2,113 towers from Oi in Brazil which closed in late November of 2013. iDEN-related churn during the quarter had a negative impact of $1.4 million. We continued to experience strong leasing demand both domestically and internationally. Amendment activity continues to be significant and contributed over 75% of incremental leasing revenue in the first quarter, reflecting a combination of coverage and capacity related 4G spending by our customers. The big four US carriers contributed over 90% of our consolidated incremental leasing revenue in the quarter. We continued to maintain leasing backlogs at record levels. Tower cash flow for the first quarter of 2014 was $237.5 million or a 20.5% increase over the year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 79.6% compared to 77% in the year earlier period. Approximately 90% of our tower cash flow was generated from our domestic sites. Our services revenues were $36.2 million compared to $39.6 million in the year earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $8.8 million in the first quarter compared to $7 million in the first quarter of 2013. Services segment operating profit margin was 24.3% compared to 17.6% in the year earlier period. SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $24.7 million, including non-cash compensation charges of $4.5 million. SG&A expenses were $20.4 million in the year earlier period, including non-cash compensation charges of $3.8 million. Increases are primarily attributable to increases in employee related costs and specifically to headcount increases in Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA was $226.7 million or an increase of 20.7% over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 67.8% in the first quarter of 2014 compared to 63.5% in the year earlier period. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 21.8% to $153.8 million compared to $126.3 million in the first quarter of 2013. AFFO per share increased 20.4% to $1.18 compared to $0.98 in the first quarter of 2013. Combined changes in the Brazilian and Canadian exchange rates during the first quarter versus our guidance positively impacted leasing revenue by a de minimus $224,000 and adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $125,000 each. Net income during the first quarter was $1.4 million compared to a net loss of $22.4 million in the year earlier period. Net income per share for the first quarter was $0.01 compared to a net loss of $0.18 per share in the year-earlier period. Net income for the quarter was positively impacted by $17.9 million gain on currency hedges related to the Oi acquisition of 2007 sites which closed March 31. Quarter end shares outstanding were 128.8 million. In the first quarter, we acquired 2,188 sites for $900.6 million in cash, including the acquisition of 2007 sites from Oi. SBA also built 57 sites during the first quarter. We ended the quarter with 22,263 sites, 15,034 of these sites are in the US and its territories and 7,229 are in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2014 were $947.5 million, consisting of $4.7 million of nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $942.8 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the first quarter includes $900.6 million incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, excluding working capital adjustments and paid earn-outs. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $16.3 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress and $11.1 million gross augmentations and tower upgrades. The substantial majority of augmentation CapEx was reimbursed by our customers. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $9.3 million to buy land and easements [ph] and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of all of our towers and 74% of our domestic towers. At the end of the quarter, the remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control is approximately 31 years. At this point, I am going to turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the first quarter with $6.9 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $363.2 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.2 times. Pro forma assuming a full quarter of operational results from the Oi acquisition, our leverage ratio was 6.9 times. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense was 3.4 times. During the quarter, we obtained a new seven-year delayed draw $1.5 billion term loan B. The note was issued at a 25 basis point discount to par. The first funding of $750 million occurred in early February and the remaining $750 million funded in late March. Interest will accrue at LIBOR plus 250 basis points with the 75 basis point LIBOR floor. Net proceeds from this financing were used to repay in full the $290 million balance on our existing term loan B to repay the $390 million outstanding balance on the revolver to fund our [indiscernible] of our 4% convertible notes in cash and to settle any premium with shares of common stock. Concurrent with any conversion, we will settle the call portion of the associated bond hedge whereby we will receive an equal number of shares as those issued to the noteholders. As a result, outstanding share count will not be impacted by the conversion of these notes under the current settlement election. We anticipate settling the remaining warrant portion of the associated hedge in cash no later than the first quarter of 2015. Based on the recent stock prices, our current cash obligation to settle these warrants is approximately $750 million. We received conversion notices totaling 259,000 of principal during the first quarter and 121.3 million thus far in the second quarter all of which conversions will settle in the second quarter. As of the end of the first quarter, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 4.1% and our weighted average maturity is just under five years. We currently have no outstanding balances under our $770 million revolver. Based on specified covenants we have available to us today $675 million under the revolt. We did not repurchasing any shares of our common stock during the quarter and currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. As you’ve heard, we had an excellent quarter, exceeding the high-end of our guidance across almost all key financial metrics. Once again we led our industry in many important growth and margin metrics. Our organic leasing activity was particularly strong in the first quarter and a prime reason for our out-performance. Based on our year to date activity and current backlogs, we're announcing sizable increases to our 2014 outlook, almost all of which are due to organic leasing and services activity. We expect to benefit from elevated levels of customer activity for the next several years as carriers build out their initial 4G coverage footprints to be followed by capacity spending as consumer adoption increases. Commentary from our customers has been very clear that network speed and quality is now and will remain a primary focus. The path to better network speed and quality is more infrastructure and that is true in all of our markets. In the first quarter we experienced strong leasing demand across our entire portfolio both domestic and international. Same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 12.0% on a gross basis and 10.4% on a net of churn basis, including iDEN related churn. This is higher than the growth rate we assumed in our initial 2014 outlook and it’s the primary reason for our increase to the outlook. We have not assumed the higher first-quarter same tower actual growth rate through the rest of the year for outlook purposes and if activity in the rest of the year were to match year to date activity levels, we would expect actual leasing results to exceed the midpoints of our outlook. We attribute our leasing success to a combination of quality assets, strong execution, good contracts and excellent demand from our customers. Strong execution was particularly evident with tower cash flow margins up 260 basis points over the year-earlier period. The first quarter in the US was another very busy quarter with respect to new leasing business, exceeding our very strong fourth quarter on the basis of gross incremental leasing revenue added net of escalation benefits. We once again executed high numbers of both new tenant leases and amendments. Amendment revenue made up the substantial majority of incremental leasing revenue in the US. Amendments are for both coverage and capacity and many amendments represent the first or second equipment change or addition after the initial 4G deployment. Our customers continue to request larger equipment loads for both leases and amendments which has a favorable impact on rate. AT&T and Verizon continued to be very busy and represented well over half of our new business in the quarter. Mobilitie and TowerCo assets we acquired in 2012 continued to outperform with respect to new leases as they were under indexed to AT&T and Verizon. We saw another quarter of material contribution from Sprint due to its network vision project and T-Mobile remains active on its 4G upgrade. Our backlogs remain large and continue to replenish. On the leasing side, we are starting to see 2.5G business from Sprint and have yet to see any 700 megahertz business from T-Mobile. We have included a small leasing benefit from Sprint 2.5G business in our 2014 outlook but nothing yet from the T-Mobile 700 megahertz business. We have included no contribution in our 2014 outlook for any prospective customer that is not currently reasonably active, so that would exclude DISH and public safety. Please keep in mind that our 2014 outlook reflects site leasing revenue on a GAAP basis while our tower cash flow adjusted EBITDA and AFFO outlooks are all on a cash basis. Total non-cash leasing revenue in 2014 is estimated to be approximately $56.7 million. Our services segment produced strong results again for us in the first quarter with all four major US carriers contributing. We executed extremely well with services margins as high as they have been in at least 10 years. Our services backlog remains high. We expect continued strong services segment contribution through 2014 and have raised the midpoint of our full year services revenue outlook by $10 million to reflect those expectations. We continue to see strong activity in our international markets in both organic leasing and portfolio growth. Internationally we are seeing strong growth in new cell sites with a lot of basic 3G coverage builds still ongoing in our markets and increasing amount of 4G coverage builds. International leasing activity is mostly new leases but there is a growing amount of amendment activity. International cash leasing revenue and tower cash flow grew materially primarily due to portfolio growth. International tower cash flow margin was [indiscernible] and only slightly below or behind those in the US reflecting strong execution. While we experienced strong growth in all of our international markets, most of the aggregate international growth was in Brazil. We had another very active quarter in Brazil. We closed on our acquisition from Oi of 2007 sites on March 31. We made good progress in Brazil on finalizing leasing agreements with the carriers from which we expect an increase in our new leasing business in Brazil. We also received a large new tower build award putting us well down the road toward our goal of being a major builder of towers in Brazil. Higher expectations around our Brazil business, including a more favorable view on exchange rates is one of the drivers to our increased 2014 outlook. I am very pleased with the progress we've made in Brazil year to date and look forward to continuing our positive momentum. We will continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities in Brazil although now having on the scale we believe that our strategic needs have been satisfied. Our operational performance across the entire company was very strong in the first quarter. Strong tower cash flow and services margins drove our adjusted EBITDA margin to an industry-leading 67.8%, a record for SBA. We think to have produced that level of margin while growing materially internationally and increasing SG&A expense to manage that international growth is a real accomplishment. Strong adjusted EBITDA results we had in the first quarter drove our equally strong AFFO and AFFO per share results. With respect to portfolio growth with the Oi acquisition of 2007 sites, we’ve already satisfied our portfolio growth goal for all of 2014, with hundreds of additional new builds expected between now and year end. We will continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities certainly in our existing markets and potentially some new markets although our preference currently is to stay in the Western Hemisphere. Our pro forma leverage post the Oi transaction is 6.9 times below our target range of 7.0 times to 7.5 times net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA. We have room under our leverage targets to pursue additional portfolio growth. Our 2014 guidance reflects only those acquisitions we have under contract today and if we are successful in consummating some additional acquisitions our 2014 outlook could increase. We have plenty of resources with which to pursue additional portfolio growth. Our access to capital and balance sheet are both in great shape. Our cash on hand undrawn $770 million revolver and anticipated AFFO generation gives us more than $1 billion of available capital. Should we seek additional financing for acquisition, the capital markets are currently very accommodative. Our outlook assumes we use our cash on hand and contemplates a $1.3 billion debt refinancing to fully cash settle the remainder of our 4% convertible notes and the related warrants and call the remaining 244 million of our 8.25% senior notes. We anticipate seeking such refinancing in the third quarter and have assumed a 4% refinancing interest rate in our 2014 outlook. As our guidance indicates we expect the current strength in our business to continue through 2014. Our focus remains the same: execute well against the favorable macro-environment, add quality growth assets and continue to take advantage of what is expected to remain a favorable financing market. With our annual portfolio growth goal already achieved, leverage within our targeted range and tremendous liquidity, we look forward to continuing to realize strong revenue and tower cash flow growth of our high quality assets. We believe we have SBA ideally positioned for future success. We expect to once again produce material growth across a number of key metrics, including growth in a AFFO per share. Before we open it for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. Our operational results were very strong in the first quarter, the strongest in recent memory. Those results come from the efforts of many and I thank all of those who contributed to our first quarter success. We look forward to reporting continued success as we move through 2014. And Tom, at this time we’re ready for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Emrie Love [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Quick question, you said that the majority of the revenue leasing activity is coming on the amendment side. Can you give any color as to what the trend is of that split, amendments versus new installations and maybe what you see as the outlook for the balance of the year?
Jeff Stoops: We – starting last year, about middle of the year we began to see a shift towards more new leases, more co-locations versus amendments, although even through perhaps the lowest contributing quarter from amendment it was still around 50%. Then in the fourth quarter we actually saw very big jump, again in the amount of amendment activity and that amendment activity has carried through the first quarter, it’s carried through our existing backlogs. And we do -- I don't know exactly how much of the splits between new leases and amendments when 2014 is all said and done will be the case, but we do expect for the full year to have sizable contributions from amendments.
Operator: Next question today comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin.
Unidentified Analyst: So at the beginning of the year, I think you were baking in about 9% to 10% organic site leasing growth in your guidance. And you’re obviously coming in well ahead of that, I think it was – I think you said it was 12% so far this year. What are you basing in for the full year now and then what are – is that a rate that we can expect you to be able to grow out for the next few years?
Jeff Stoops: Well, it’s hard to answer the last part of your questions. But the levels of activity that have produced these growth rates today we think should stay substantially the same for years to come. Now what we have in our current and updated outlook is a 10% net cash revenue growth, is that correct, Brendan?
Brendan Cavanagh: That’s right.
Jeff Stoops: So up from where we initially put forth guidance but not quite as high as what we actually experienced in Q1.
Unidentified Analyst: And what would cause revenue growth, organic revenue growth to slow down from Q1? It sounds like there is a lot more activity coming in the back half of the year but it isn’t included in guidance, if anything it seems like it should accelerate?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I think it’s just a healthy dose of conservatism.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin [RBC Capital Markets]
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: I wondered if you could give us a sense of what’s happening at your site in terms of the eight physical decommissioning of iDEN gear and then the same question as it relates to the – taking down of CDMA by T-Mobile?
Jeff Stoops: We’re not seeing much take down of CDMA by T-Mobile, Jon. On the iDEN sites there are a number of towers and we started this process a year ago where we’ve evaluated what we think of the asset post iDEN termination. And in some cases we decided to decommission those towers. I think we have some more of that yet to come this year but as we move into 2015 and beyond those decommissioning numbers should to begin to slow.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: I mean you’ve made certain assumptions with regard to the financial impact but I was curious when the actual physical de-installation keeping pace, so that is kind of behind the question, and if you can also maybe give us a sense of M&A thought outside of the US, there may be further assets for sale for instance in Brazil or nearby or even further out markets and just curious kind of to get your sense to your appetite for participating in that type of deal?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, just to be clear on your first question about the iDEN, you were talking about Sprint decomming their equipment as opposed to us decomming towers, is that right?
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: Correct.
Jeff Stoops: We are seeing Sprint decom equipment at the site, for the most part they have shut down their network. It's really more a function of just getting to all the sites I think from a resource standpoint to actually remove equipment but that doesn't necessarily sync up with the timing of the leases decomming or churning off which will take place over several year period. So I would say we’re only partly through the actual physical decommissions.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the M&A side, Jon, we continue to be interested, we’ve had a long history of creating shareholder value through successful portfolio growth. I do believe we have more of that in our future. I think it is safe to say that the opportunity set is probably greater outside the United States than it currently is in the United States. So we will continue to look around the globe as I mentioned in the comments, we are more interested in continued Western Hemisphere growth. But we do -- we are interested in the right portfolio growth where we’re confident that it’s going to lead to increased value.
Operator: Our next question today comes from line of Amir Rozwadowski [Barclays Capital].
Amir Rozwadowski – Barclays Capital:  Jeff, you mentioned on prior, response to a prior question that there is a healthy dose of conservatism to your outlook [indiscernible] to ask is how much conservatism?
Jeff Stoops: I didn’t, we didn’t really quantify it. I mean if you extrapolate the rate of same tower revenue or same tower cash revenue growth in Q1 at 10.4 versus 10 on a net basis that’s implied in the outlook, you probably could come up with some numbers.
Amir Rozwadowski – Barclays Capital: And then you mentioned – you’re still seeing a healthy amount of amendment activity in the marketplace. If we’re thinking about sort of the opportunity set for new tower leases, I mean there has been a lot of questions around the amount of investment that would be required for densification purposes, I would love to hear sort of any insight you have as to when you expect to see down level of investment pickup in earnest and how we should think about the opportunity set there relative to the amendment activity?
Jeff Stoops: Well, it’s interesting because what we're seeing now in large part on the amendments is densification. As I mentioned a lot of these amendments are going on sites where there already has been an initial 4G rollout. So we’re literally seeing another amendment on top of that and in some cases the second amendment all after the initial 4G deployment has been rolled out. So we view that as densification as well. But I think all the factors that are at play increasing wireless demand that you’re going to end up with shrinking cell densities. And I think that bodes very, very well for not only increase amendments but also increased new cell co-efficiency.
Operator: And our next question is from David Barden [BofA Merrill Lynch].
David Barden – BofA Merrill Lynch: Two questions if I could. Jeff, just with respect to your comments about the loading of the towers increasing, could you elaborate a little bit, is that really about an increased deployment of remote ratio head ends or is there some other kind of structural change in the network architecture you're seeing that’s going to be incrementally additive to growth? And then second question I guess is there is a constant kind of chatter about the T-Mobile Sprint merger, one of the theories is that Sprint might be slowing down its network build in order to preserve some of the upside opportunities that might exist down the road by building one combined network rather than two separate networks. Are you seeing any -- in your pipeline of business with Sprint that would suggest that there is hedging or slow rolling to builds to maybe accomplish some of those goals, if you could just shed some color on that would be great?
Jeff Stoops: I mean it’s possible, David, because what we've seen out of Sprint is a lot of activity but it's all about the initial network vision project. So going beyond the network vision project, other than just 2.5G business which is just really get started, I don't know that we've seen certainly the levels of activity from Sprint that we’ve seen from say AT&T or Verizon. So you may be right there. Sprint has been very busy but it’s still pretty much all centered around the initial network vision project. And on the loads, most of the action is now going on, or comprised of the remote radio heads and it's really just the volume of equipment, we’re seeing many many installations now where there is north of 20 lines and 20 antennas.
Operator: And we have a question from Jonathan Schildkraut [Evercore Partners].
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: Two, if I may. First, just going through the release last night, I noticed there was a big jump in the straight-line assumption for the year. Obviously, you had some really good leasing, but I was wondering if there was a little bit more behind that? And then second, I was wondering if there was any color in terms of what you're seeing on the tower, the two-transmitter, two-radio design I think that most of the carriers went out with initially. Everybody's been talking about an upgrade here to 4T4R, and I was wondering in terms of your towers, where you thought that was?
Brendan Cavanagh: Jon, first on the straight line, basically all of that increase is associated with Brazil and specifically the two Oi transactions that we did, just over the last two quarters the leaseback from Oi includes a minimum escalator although all of the lease escalation down there are tied to the Brazilian CPI index, there is a minimum that’s built into the leaseback from OI in both of those deals, which creates a very large straight-line component, that quite honestly wasn't contemplated in the initial guidance numbers that we gave out, we only included the cash piece as there were still a lot of information to process around calculating that straight-line. And so we started to recognize in the first quarter, have included the increase in our guidance associated with that.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, on the equipment Jonathan, we’re not seeing a lot yet on the new architecture, most of what we’re experiencing now is the historic radios on ground and radios on the tower business and that’s -- we think there's a lot of that business left to go before we get into the next generation of architecture.
Operator: And our next question comes from Phil Cusic [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Hi this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the equipment. I guess you're saying that there is first and second amendments on the initial deployment. Can you give us a sense on how far along that process that we're in? Is it 10%, 20%, or few first few [indiscernible] or has this been going on for a while? And I guess with that, in the outlook, are we still looking at a 75%/25% amendment co-location mix for the year or do we expect ago to more of a 50:50 by some point later this year?
Jeff Stoops: I think it will be somewhere between 75 and 50 as we move through the whole year. And I'm sorry what’s your question again?
Unidentified Analyst: In terms of hitting those -- can you give us a sense of how many initial 4G deployments have been hit the first or second time and where do you think that might go?
Jeff Stoops: Well that is a great but difficult question to answer, because it’s really all going to be driven by the local site traffic patterns, how much data is being promulgated over that particular site. But I mean our history has, as you know any future applicability maybe half of the sites over time are going to see second, third amendments, for the basic 4G deployments.
Unidentified Analyst: And one final one, in terms of the network services margin, can we see this level above 20% versus the historical high teens going forward?
Jeff Stoops: I think we’re going to have strong margins, I don't know if we’re going to have north of 20% margins every quarter throughout the year but I do think we’re in an environment here where over the course of the year we’re going to have probably the strongest margins that we’ve had.
Operator: And we have a question from Simon Flannery [Morgan Stanley].
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: There has been a lot of talk in the earnings season about the rapid growth in data and people deploying small cells and the increasing use of Wi-Fi. Can you update us on ExteNet and your position towards small cells and how you think macro cells versus small cells versus Wi-Fi will play out over time?
Jeff Stoops: Well, we continue to enjoy our relationship with ExteNet. They’re busier today than they were several years ago, we think that’s going to continue to grow and we think small cells are definitely going to have a place in network architecture. But clearly from our results they’re not cutting into the macro business and we really see continued strong growth in both small cells and the macro side of the network architecture.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Is there any sense of you becoming -- getting a bigger ownership in ExteNet or are you comfortable with where things are today?
Jeff Stoops: We will see, we will see, we do not have the right to control that issue. But we have a relationship with ExteNet and should the opportunity arise we certainly would take a look.
Operator: And next, we will go to the line of Ric Prentiss [Raymond James]
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: Thanks, good morning, guys. Obviously very strong organic growth, also appreciate the domestic versus international break-outs. As you think about that 10.4% net of churn 1Q experience, how would you think that looks international, domestic, as you look at your ‘14 guidance? I would assume iDEN churn also needs to come up through the year since it was pretty low in 1Q.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, it will come up a little bit and to be honest with you, our domestic same tower growth rate was slightly higher than our international, because we’re still progressing and making, trying to get up to hitting on all eight cylinders in our Brazilian market. And we had -- the only towers in Brazil that were included in those calculations were 800 towers that we acquired at the end of 2012 and we’re seeing all kinds of great prospects and momentum with – getting these leasing agreements in place to get that up. But candidly the domestic same tower growth rate was slightly higher than international.
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: And then you mentioned a large build order in Brazil, but you didn't change I don't think your build guidance. Has that been something you've been working on for a while and what kind of magnitude are we looking at?
Jeff Stoops: We just got it, that may prove to give us cause to increase that over the year, it’s about 500 tower new builds award that we got.
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: And obviously, some of it will probably slip into ‘15 as well given the time?
Jeff Stoops: Oh, yes, absolutely.
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: And then the final question is, thinking through the M&A outside the US question, how do you manage the visibility of a great business with the volatility of some of the FX things we've seen? Do you feel you're getting large enough in Brazil? I'm just trying to think of how you manage the risk, if you will, of a diversified portfolio.
Jeff Stoops: Brazil is a great market, it’s got a tremendous future for new network investment, but it does have the FX issues. Over time, over 10, 20 year history, the FX of the reais versus the US dollar has moved in a fairly predictable pattern but that is definitely something that would mitigate our desire to get even larger in – and I can’t give you a mathematical answer, Ric, as to how much of our overall exposure that we would be willing to subject to FX risk, there are definitely limits there that will factor into how big we will ultimately get in any non-US market [ph].
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: And obviously doing builds also get you a lower-cost of asset down there too?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, I mean the reason we are down there is really for this new – for the new build business because there’s so much to be done down there, we acquired some scale and some operating competency but we’re just now on the cusp of doing what we really want to be doing down there which is lot of new builds.
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: And I think I've heard Brendan say in the past, two-thirds of the pops, but one-third of the towers in Brazil, is that still kind of the thinking?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah their average cell site services 4000 people versus the 1000 in the US.
Operator: And our next question is from Michael Bowen [Pacific Crest Securities].
Michael Bowen – Pacific Crest Securities: Can you talk a little bit about organic growth going forward? Because we keep on getting a lot of questions with regard to how good can it get and really what inning are we in? And then second question, with regard to core growth rates, you guys have talked about 9% to 10% pre-iDEN churn, can you help split that out domestic versus international?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, the domestic gross number was 12.2 and the international number was slightly less than that. Those are the gross numbers. And in terms of how far it goes, again that’s a question the answer to which will be definitely and driven by how far wireless data goes, the things that will drive that will be some additional spectrum auctions which are on the horizon 600 MHz we think will have a very large impact in terms of additional core organic growth in the US. The 700 MHz in Brazil we think the same, so the combination of wireless data growth and new spectrum we think gives us a pretty long runway here.
Michael Bowen – Pacific Crest Securities: And lastly in Brazil, there are some pretty sizable portfolios down that are still potentially up for sale. How should we think about it or how are you guys thinking about timing, price, and how long these processes typically take, so we can potentially start at least thinking about layering this into a long-term model?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, we have an interest in some of those assets for the right price, going back to the comment I made to Ric that we do think that there is a limit on how much we would want to grow in Brazil. We don't think we’re at that limit yet. So those, there are some assets out there that for the right price we would have an interest in.
Michael Bowen – Pacific Crest Securities: One last quick one. With your guidance, can we also assume that you're still not including the additional 50 million pop coverage from Sprint and the 100 million with 2.5 at Sprint?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, on the leasing side, little bit in the services, there is little bit of that in the services outlook but not on the leasing side.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Colby Synesael [Cowen and Company]
Colby Synesael – Cowen and Company: Two questions. First off, on international and the escalators, can you remind us what percentage of your escalators are fixed outside the US versus tied to CPI? And then what your assumptions are in your guidance for those that are tied to CPI? And then my other question just real quickly, just wanted to reaffirm your thoughts on REIT in terms of timing?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, on the escalators Colby, all of our escalators internationally are fixed with the exception of Brazil where all of the escalators in Brazil are tied to CPI, the one exception to that as I mentioned earlier in discussing the straight line component is that the Oi deals that we did, both of them have a leaseback from Oi on those sites, so that’s over 4000 leases. Those do have a minimum escalators, so they’re tied to the CPI but at no less than a minimum which is 6.5%. So all of our Central America leases have fixed escalators that mirror generally what we see here in the US in the 3% to 4% range.
Jeff Stoops: Yeah on the REIT status, as we’ve said many times we do see REIT election in our future. It’s probably as every month goes by, getting closer, I don't know that it will be something that we do this year. We’re watching a lot of the goings on around proposed law changes in that area, and that is something that may cause us to accelerate things. We're not at a point yet and it will not be this year where we would have positive earnings and profits, for purposes of making an encouraging [ph] distribution which we think is an important timing event as to when we might otherwise elect status. So I mean in general without giving you exact date I would say we probably stepped up our work on the area of ultimately electing REIT status.
Colby Synesael – Cowen and Company: Yeah but I think previously you had said maybe 2020 or even beyond and it sounds like I guess that's potentially changing now?
Jeff Stoops: I think it will be before that.
Operator: The next question today comes from the line of Mike McCormack [Jefferies & Company]
Mike McCormack – Jefferies & Company: Jeff, maybe just a quick comment on this Sprint build. You said it's obviously fairly small right now, but just wondering if you're seeing that, is it widespread and small or is it very concentrated? And then secondly, Wi-Fi, the small cell opportunity, a lot of cable companies out there are talking about trying to do a build. Do you view that as a threat or a potential opportunity, if we were to see Wi-Fi deployed on more of a macro basis?
Jeff Stoops: I think the Sprint is wide, there is a lot of geographic areas where that is, so it’s not narrow macro although as I mentioned the volume is not quite there yet, we think that's yet to come. And on the cable, on the Wi-Fi method of delivering signal is really still more of a fixed location type of technology. So we really don't see it as a threat to macro sites, all of these cable companies that are talking about this, at least the ones that I have seen have talked about having roaming deals with the one, the cellular providers. And you really have to have macro sites to provide the mobility aspect of wireless service. So much as we don't believe that small cells will impact the macro sites, we feel that it’s been way about Wi-Fi.
Mike McCormack – Jefferies & Company: Jeff, do you think though that as cable companies become more ubiquitous in trying to offer some sort of, whether it's a retention strategy or a wireless strategy and right now they're doing these Sprint networks in each individual home, but maybe an opportunity at some point down the road for you guys to have that deployed in a more widespread basis?
Jeff Stoops: Certainly there will be a lot of money spent in that area. I'm not exactly sure that the economics will prove as interesting to us as our core tower business.
Operator: And gentlemen there are no further questions queuing up at this time.
Jeff Stoops: Great. Well, I appreciate everybody joining us today on the call and we look forward to our second quarter earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for standing by, and welcome you to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Fourth Quarter 2013's Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we'll discuss in this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2014 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others that affected historical results may affect future results, and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, February 26, 2014, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined by Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Brendan to comment on our fourth quarter results.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another strong quarter in all areas. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance for leasing revenue and exceeded the high end of our guidance for tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Changes in the Brazilian exchange rate during the fourth quarter versus our guidance negatively impacted leasing revenue by $400,000 and adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $200,000 each. Total revenues were $335.4 million, up 14% over the year-earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $292.5 million or a 12.1% increase over the fourth quarter of 2012. As a reminder, on a sequential basis, approximately $3 million of site leasing revenue in the third quarter of 2013 was nonrecurring. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including our initial Brazil acquisition of 800 towers, which closed at end of 2012, and our second Brazil acquisition of 2,113 towers, which closed in late November 2013. iDEN-related churn during the quarter had a negative impact of $1.3 million. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue continues to come from the U.S. and its territories, with approximately 8.6% of total leasing revenue in the quarter coming from international operations. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $217.6 million or a 16.4% increase over the year-earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 78.3% compared to 77.7% in the year-earlier period. We have been able to expand our international operations with little impact to our tower cash flow margins. We continue to experience strong leasing demand both domestically and internationally. Amendment activity continues to be strong, still contributing over half of incremental leasing revenue in the fourth quarter. New collocation leases contributed just over 40% of our new leasing revenue added in the quarter. This is up from about 15% in the fourth quarter of 2012. The big 4 U.S. carriers contributed approximately 90% of our consolidated incremental leasing activity in the quarter. We continue to maintain leasing backlog at record levels. Our services revenues were $42.9 million compared to $33.1 million in the year-earlier period, reflecting generally higher activity levels and work mandated to us by our Sprint Network Vision contract and T-Mobile 4G agreement. Services segment operating profit was $9.2 million in the fourth quarter compared to $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Services segment operating profit margin was 21.4% compared to 17.6% in the year-earlier period. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $21.7 million, including noncash compensation charges of $4.1 million. SG&A expenses were $19.6 million in the year-earlier period, including noncash compensation charges of $3.3 million. Our overhead efficiency continues to improve as we grow. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.7% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $209.4 million or an 18.3% increase over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 65.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 64.7% in the year-earlier period, notwithstanding a much higher contribution from our lower-margin services business. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 23.1% to $139.1 million compared to $112.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. AFFO per share increased 21.6% to $1.07 compared to $0.88 in the fourth quarter of 2012. Net loss during the fourth quarter was $19.2 million compared to a net loss of $52.6 million in the year-earlier period. Net loss per share for the fourth quarter was $0.15 compared to a net loss of $0.42 per share in the year-earlier period. Quarter-end shares outstanding were $128.4 million. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 2,138 sites for $321.1 million in cash. SBA also built 119 sites during the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with 20,079 owned sites. 14,886 of these sites are in the U.S. and its territories and 5,193 are in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $403.9 million, consisting of $5.7 million of nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $398.2 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the fourth quarter includes $321.1 million incurred in connection with tower acquisitions excluding working capital adjustments and paid earn-outs. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $21.7 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress, $23.3 million related to the purchase of new offices and $14.8 million for Gross Augmentations and tower upgrades. Of the $14.8 million augmentation figure, approximately $10.7 million or 73% was simultaneously reimbursed by our customers, resulting in net augmentation cash expenditures to us of $4.1 million. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $15 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of all of our towers and 73% of our domestic towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is slightly over 30 years. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the fourth quarter with $5.9 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $175 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is 6.8x. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.3x. During the fourth quarter, we paid $55.5 million in cash and issued approximately 192,000 shares of common stock to settle the warrants associated with our 1 7/8% convertible notes. We have no further obligation with regard to these notes and the related warrants. Earlier this month, we obtained a new 7-year delayed draw $1.5 billion Term Loan B. The note was issued at a 25-basis-point discount to par. The first funding of $750 million occurred on February 7 and we expect the remaining $750 million to fund next month. Interest will accrue at LIBOR plus 250 basis points with a 75-basis-point LIBOR floor. This spread and LIBOR floor represent a combined improvement of 50 basis points compared to our previous Term Loan B, which we issued in 2012. Net proceeds from this financing were used to repay in full the $290 million balance on our existing Term Loan Bs and to repay the $390 million outstanding balance on our revolver. The remaining proceeds will be used to pay for our pending 2007 site Brazilian Oi acquisition and for general corporate purposes. As of the end of the fourth quarter and pro forma for the recent financing, the weighted-average coupon of our outstanding debt is 4.1% and our weighted average maturity is 5 years. We currently have no outstanding balance under our revolver and the full $770 million in commitments is available to us. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter and currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As you have heard, we did have another very good quarter, nearing or exceeding the high end of our guidance across almost all key financial metrics. Once again, we led our industry in many important growth metrics. SBA continues to perform in strong and steady fashion. Our organic leasing activity was particularly strong all through 2013 and the primary reason for our outperformance. We experienced strong demand across our entire portfolio, both domestic and international. In the U.S., we are seeing the benefits from that demand in both our leasing and services segments. We expect to benefit from these elevated levels of activity for the next several years as carriers build out their initial 4G coverage footprints to be followed by capacity spending as consumer adoption increases. Commentary from our customers has been very clear, that network speed and quality is now and will remain a primary focus. The path to better network speed and quality is more infrastructure. We are seeing strong activity in both amendments to existing carrier sites and new site locations in the U.S. and our backlogs remain large and continue to replenish. Internationally, we are seeing strong growth in new cell sites with a lot of basic 3G coverage builds ongoing in our markets. We look forward to the buildout of 4G in many of our international markets in the future. As a result of anticipated continued strong demand from our U.S. and international customers, we are guiding to strong organic leasing growth once again in 2014. A portion of the increase in our 2014 leasing revenue outlook is due to higher than anticipated -- previously anticipated organic leasing activity. In the fourth quarter, in the U.S., we had a very busy quarter with respect to new leasing business. And we signed up another high number of both new tenant leases and amendments. Our customers are requesting larger equipment loads, which has a favorable impact on rate. AT&T and Verizon continue to be very busy and represented well over half of our new business in the quarter. As a result, the Mobilitie and TowerCo assets we acquired in 2012 outperformed because they were under index to AT&T and Verizon. We saw another material contribution from Sprint due to its Network Vision project and T-Mobile remains active on its 4G upgrade. We have just started to see 2.5G business from Sprint and have yet to see any 700-megahertz business from T-Mobile. Although there is a chance both could contribute to leasing revenue in the second half of 2014, neither is yet reflected in our leasing outlook for 2014. Our services segment produced another strong level of activity for us in the fourth quarter, once again with the primary contributors being the Sprint Network Vision and T-Mobile 4G projects. Services revenue of over $170 million in 2013 was an annual record for SBA by a wide margin. Our services backlog remains high. We expect continued strong services segment contribution through 2014, although we do expect in our 2014 outlook reflects our work on the Sprint Network Vision project tapering off as the work we were contracted to perform near completion, some of which will be offset by new work on Sprint's 2.5-gigahertz initiatives. We continue to see strong activity in our international markets in both leasing activity and portfolio growth. Leasing activity is mostly new leases, but there is a growing amount of amendment activity. We had a busy year end in Brazil. We closed on our first acquisition from Oi of 2,113 sites and entered into agreement to acquire another 2,007 sites from Oi, which is scheduled to close March 31. We will continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities in Brazil, although now having gotten to scale, we believe that our strategic needs have been satisfied. We are on the process of establishing substantial newbuild and leasing capabilities in Brazil. We now have about 35 experienced employees in Brazil, on our way to 50 to 55 by year-end. We will continue to expand our Brazilian workforce as we grow. But with much of our back-office functions located in the U.S., we expect our Brazilian overhead to grow in the future at a fraction of the rate of growth we expect in Brazilian revenue. With respect to portfolio growth, we had another strong year exceeding the high end of our portfolio growth goal in 2013. We're off to a very strong start in 2014 and we anticipate exceeding the high end of our annual goal by the end of the first quarter. We will continue to look for additional opportunities certainly in our existing markets and potentially some new markets, although our preference currently is to stay in the Western Hemisphere. With our leverage currently below our target range of 7.0 to 7.5x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA and within the target range pro forma for the pending Oi transaction, we are seeking additional portfolio growth, notwithstanding already having exceeded the high-end goal of 10% annual portfolio growth on a pro forma basis. Our 2014 guidance reflects only those acquisitions we have under contract today. And if we are successful in consummating some additional acquisitions, our 2014 outlook could increase. We have plenty of resources with which to pursue additional portfolio growth. Our access to capital and balance sheet are both in great shape. Our recent $1.5 billion Term Loan B transaction was very successful and resulted in our lowering our weighted average cost of debt, increasing our average tenure and putting over $150 million into the bank. That additional cash borrowed and currently unused negatively impacts our 2014 outlook for cash interest expense, but the terms were very attractive and we like the liquidity. Our cash on hand, undrawn $770 million revolver and anticipated AFFO generation gives us more than $1 billion of available capital. We have substantially more available when you consider our ability to settle all or a portion of our 4% convertible notes due October 2014 in stock to maintain target leverage should we find a large, attractive acquisition opportunity. Our outlook assumes we use cash on hand to call the remaining $244 million of our 8.25% senior notes and contemplates a $1.3 billion debt refinancing to fully cash-settle our 4% convertible notes without any settlement for stock, so a cash refinancing is contemplated there. We anticipate seeking such refinancing in the third quarter and we have assumed a 4% refinancing interest rate in our 2014 outlook. As our guidance indicates, we expect the current strength in our business to continue through 2014. Our 2014 outlook continues to reflect same-tower cash revenue growth similar to 2013 in the 9% to 10% range before iDEN terminations. We have included no material contribution in 2014 from any customer that was not reasonably active in 2013, so that would exclude DISH and Public Safety. We are anticipating in our services outlook some Sprint 2.5G activity, although not yet in our leasing outlook. Please keep in mind that our 2014 outlook reflects site leasing revenue on a GAAP basis, while our tower cash flow adjusted EBITDA and AFFO outlooks are all on a cash basis. Total noncash leasing revenue in 2014 for the straight-line impact is expected to be approximately $44 million. In the aggregate, we believe 2014 will be another strong year for SBA. Our focus this year is straightforward: execute well against a favorable macro environment, add quality growth assets and continue to take advantage of what is expected to remain a favorable financing market. With our annual portfolio growth goal already under contract, leverage within our target range and tremendous liquidity, we look forward to continuing to improve our international capabilities and realizing strong revenue growth on our high-quality assets. We believe we have SBA ideally positioned for future success. We expect to once again produce material growth across a number of key metrics, including growth in AFFO per share. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. Our employees worked really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. They do a great job. Our customers recognize that and as a result, we are a preferred provider for our customers' network needs. Our customers are and, we think, will remain extremely busy improving and expanding their wireless networks. We look forward to continued success as we move through 2014. And Amanda, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Jeff, I want to go back on one of the last things you've talked about, the same-tower revenue growth, and I think you said 9% to 10%. Now is that GAAP, not cash?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: No, that's cash. Correct.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: That's cash.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes. The way we look at that is we take off everything we had in Q4 of 2013 and look at where we're projecting to be in Q4 of 2014. And then taking out the impact of the acquisitions, it pencils out to about 9% to 10% growth rate.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And then the iDEN termination or iDEN churn that will be in 2014, how much of a negative is that, that would come down off that number?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Approximately 1.5%.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And is there an ability to look at what the growth rate is domestically versus internationally since you have now increased the portfolio by the fourth quarter?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. I mean, it's -- we're still getting Brazil off the ground, but we're probably 8% to 9% U.S. and then the remainder in international. So you're talking 300 or 400 basis points higher because of the lower number of sites and the lower amount of revenue off which that's basing. All in company-wide, 9% to 10% before iDEN.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Makes sense. There's been a lot of consternation it seems with FX rates the way they're going. People trying to figure out, given that international might be 11% to 13% growth, how does FX affect that? How do you look at return on invested capital on those international portfolios, given that growth rate you're seeing?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we're looking for, over time, 300 to 500 basis points above what we're expecting in the U.S., which will be a low double-digit number. So as we move through our 5-year plus time horizon, Rick, that's what we're modeling and expecting to get.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And comfort -- with the FX, you can't control FX, obviously, but comfort that still put minor work in Brazil. You mentioned you're looking at acquisitions in the Brazil market.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we're -- we believe there will be some additional assets available and we will continue to -- no, my point in my comment was we feel like our strategic geographic flag has been planted with enough scale that we're in good shape there to proceed on a more of a build-to-suit basis. But just as we have always in the U.S., we'll be looking for good acquisitions that make eminent financial sense going forward.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: So still a lot of comfort that investing in international even in Brazil is going to be a good return.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: For the right price.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: And Rick, we do consider FX when we're looking at what our plans are. And one of the ways that that's mitigated is that all of the escalators in our lease agreements in Brazil are tied to inflationary indexes down there. So those tend to come in at a much higher rate, which is a mitigant to the risk of a weakening FX rate.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then augmentation, $15 million in the quarter, 73% reimbursed. If you look at your 2014 guidance, what's the expectation of what augmentation is in the CapEx and what reimbursement might be?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Well, the augmentation is in at -- roughly what we had for this year, so you're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million to $60 million for the year. From a reimbursement standpoint, we would expect that to continue at a similar clip. Although that doesn't -- when we give guidance, we're putting the gross amount in our discretionary CapEx. So the reimbursements are capitalized and amortized into income over the term of the lease agreement that they're related to.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Exactly. So you spread that over 7, 10 years or whatever the remaining lease is.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Right.
Operator: Next in queue is David Barden with Bank of America.
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a couple. This first, Brendan, it feels like or sounds like the iDEN churn has not been at the worst case, which you've baked into your guidance. Do you -- would you still have, I think, the worst case baked into the forward outlook? But do you have some kind of increased level of comfort or communication with Sprint on their intentions and the expectation that maybe this is more of an overly conservative view at this stage of the game? I think the second question is real quick, a smaller one is, just on the -- subsequent to the fourth quarter ending disclosures, you talked about a small portfolio that you bought that the implied value per tower is $1.5 million, which is a big number. I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit on that deal. And then just lastly, in terms of -- on Rick's question, just international. There's obviously a lot of other international portfolios that have been thrown out there in Africa, in India. Your wheelhouse has been really the Latin America and to a lesser degree Canada markets. Are you kind of interested in venturing further afield? Are you comfortable kind of in your home base here?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Okay. David, first, on the iDEN, we have been assuming worst case, which is made up of 2 things, which is the total number of leases that they are entitled to terminate in any 1 quarter and we've assumed that they'd terminate the highest dollar leases first for purposes of guidance. They have been terminating their full allotment in terms of number of leases each quarter. However, they've not necessarily been the highest dollar leases first. Based on what we've learned to date, we were able to pick up about $1 million to our revenue guidance for 2014 based on actual notices versus that worst case assumption. It is possible and probably likely that there will be some additional pick up during the year. We continued with the convention though that we've been using and, frankly, I think that pickup will be relatively immaterial. And as we get further along, the -- what's left, the average becomes closer to what we would expect them to terminate.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: On the acquisitions, David, we did acquire some very high cash flow sites, high-quality towers, had some really nice tenants beyond the big 4 folks like the Coast Guard and guys who we're very comfortable with, big installations, big dollar rents, and we acquired that for a mid-teens multiple. We're very happy with that transaction but that was what that was all about. And in terms of future expansion, we are deciding this year how much additional international growth we're going to pursue. On a pro forma basis, we have about 15% of our revenue internationally. 10% of that -- well, 2/3 of that is in Brazil. So we're considering where we want to go. Given that there will be some limits on how far we want to take that, which I can't define for you today, we are likely to be able to satisfy everything we want to do inside those limits within the near-term by continuing to stay in the Western Hemisphere. So that makes not impossible, but I think unlikely that, at least for the next year, we'd do anything outside the Western Hemisphere.
Operator: Next in queue is Jonathan Atkin.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Yes, I wondered in Brazil if you could kind of tell us of the portfolios that you -- the towers that you have bought and closed on what kind of lease-up you -- contribution you saw. And now that you kind of have a team on the ground, how do you feel about integrating kind of all the systems and records? Are you ready -- is there going to be further improvements in your ability to accommodate demand on those sites? Or do you have more kind of back-office work that you need to do?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, really the only sites that we've had for any period of time, Jonathan, were the 800 Vivo sites, which we probably added 20, 30 leases on. Happy with those numbers. The telecom towers stuff came in, in September. I know we've added some leases there, probably a little bit on the Oi 2013. Obviously, we don't own yet the Oi 2007. So where we are is we are continuing to develop the master terms and conditions with the carriers, which is a process and kind of a norm that we need to have down there to truly be hitting on all 8 cylinders. That process is well underway. We're almost done with everybody there. We are adding some folks. We will continue to improve our leasing capabilities and transfer as quickly as we possibly can, the skills, the culture, the methods that we've learned in United States over the years to Brazil. But we still have a little bit more to do down there in terms of people cultivation.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then in the U.S., can you tell us how much of your growth was basically MLA-driven versus kind of falling outside of activities relating to MLAs within the carriers you've been signing with?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, with the -- I mean, the T-Mobile MLA was all kind of already included because that had a stepped-up escalator over time. So some of that contributed in the fourth quarter but not any kind of different than where it had been previously. On the Sprint deal, we recognize on a cash basis the amendments as they are installed, although they were -- the payment terms were obligated. So there was some but a little bit. The vast, vast, vast majority, Jonathan, which we've kind intimated because we said most of the activity was from AT&T and Verizon, was outside of any MLA-type structure.
Operator: Next in queue is Jonathan Schildkraut.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: So 2 questions that jump out. First, on the international side, just to dig in a little bit more. Jeff, you talked about 15% of the revenue being pro forma, about 10% coming from Brazil. I also -- we've talked about in the past that a good portion of your revenues outside of the U.S. are U.S. dollar-denominated. So I just wanted to make sure I understood if it was just the Brazil that is foreign currency denominated amongst the international? And then my second question just has to do with Sprint Spark and T-Mobile 700-megahertz, if those carriers pick up activity around those 2 spectrum band in the back half of the year, how does that roll through the reported numbers at SBA, given the MLAs?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: On the international, the only other country that is not U.S. dollar-denominated, Jonathan, is Canada, which is a fairly small piece of the remaining 5%. On the -- and I'm sorry, your last question on the Sprint and T-Mobile. The T-Mobile 700 is totally outside their existing 4G modernization agreement with us. And the Sprint 2.5G could fall inside or could fall outside depending on how much on a per-site basis the agreed-upon equipment bucket has already been filled before the 2.5G equipment comes on. So that will be determined on a site-by-site basis. We know that there'll be some additional leasing revenue because we know some buckets have been filled. Can't tell you how much at this point.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And if I can just ask 1 more question, we're going through the calculation around the converts for later this year. We're showing, I don't know, call it, $825 million, $850 million of incremental capital on top of the face value. I just want to make sure that that's in line with what the company is seeing. And then I was wondering if there were warrants similar to the 1.75% convert warrants.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Jonathan, that number is in line with what we think is obviously subject to change depending on movements in the stock price, but that's in the right range. And that really is the value on the warrants because we have a bond hedge that offsets the notes that effectively makes them settleable at just their face amount. So it's really the warrants that drive that incremental premium, that $800 million, $850 million that you're talking about and they are similar to the previous deal. They just have different terms.
Operator: Next up is Michael Bowen.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Two. First, on EPS, I think you've mentioned some asset impairments and I'm sorry if I missed it, but if you could talk a little bit about that. And secondly, with regard to Sprint, we talked a lot about the 2.5 gigahertz, but I want to go back. Sprint has talked about an additional 50 million POP coverage using the 800 and 1,900-megahertz. And I think, heretofore, you've said that's not -- that is also not in your contemplated 2014 guidance as well. And if that is the case also, are you seeing activity there and can you give us some color around that?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: I'll take the first one, the asset impairment question. There was a -- there's a higher amount of what we call asset impairment and decommissioning cost and it's really -- this year relative to previous years, and it's really attributable to my concerted effort on our part this year to focus on towers that are -- over the last 17 years that are underperforming sites that we've made a focus on decommissioning those sites, recovering some of the costs that we incur on a regular basis associated with those sites. These are nonrevenue-producing sites or iDEN-only sites, where we've determined that Sprint will no longer be using those sites so we've decommissioned those. So basically what goes through that line is the cost of writing down the carrying value of those assets, as well as the actual cost of taking down the tower to the extent that we'd do that. Most of that line is a noncash item. It's a write-off as opposed to actual cash expense.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: On the Sprint, we have not seen a lot yet of that, although we have seen some that's come in the form of brand new leases and outside of the existing MLA agreements.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And again, that's not contemplated in your '14 guidance, correct?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: No, it's not.
Operator: Now we'll move on to the line of Jonathan Chaplin.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP: This is Spencer Kurn in for Jonathan. One of the biggest concerns amongst investors is the potential impact of a Sprint-T-Mo merger. I was wondering if you could just talk about how you view the impact -- the potential impact of the merger. And just in general, what sort of impact have you seen from consolidating events?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, one of the benefits and one of the reasons that we did enter into MLAs with Sprint and T-Mobile was to reduce the risk of that possibility, Jonathan. And in doing so, we got greatly extended lives. So our average T-Mo lease now has 6 years left and our average Sprint lease now has 8 years left. The overlap, where they're both on the same site, if you lost the shortest-term lease of those 2, it's about 6% of revenue and that, of course, if it occurs at all, would be spread out over a long period of time. The big consolidation that you might draw comparisons to, although it's very dissimilar, was when Cingular acquired AT&T. That was very different because they're working on the same technologies and it was a much easier integration. And I think the decommissioning there was much less -- or had a much greater potential. And at the end of the day, we had on a combined basis, higher revenue from that combined company than we did from each of its predecessors because they still had a lot to do on their networks to now support new services for the combined subscriber base. And we think that something similar would occur if Sprint and T-Mo ever got together, although the initial integration would be much more difficult and I think the initial decommissioning would be much slower because of the disparate technologies that they both use.
Operator: We'll move on to the line of Phil Cusick.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Richard for Phil. Just a clarification on the Sprint Spark stuff. That seems like it's going to be on a case-by-case basis, but how would you move that into guidance? Is it something that you need to get a better clarity around or sizing of it? Or is it just something that is going to kind of come through in the results as you go through?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: The latter. We'll just probably take it in through actual results.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then on the T-Mobile side, would that warrant another MLA or an update in MLA? Or do you think that the 700 would be more on a site-by-site basis?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Don't know the answer to that yet. It's still a little early. I mean, T-Mo hasn't even acquired Spectrum yet. Although there have -- discussions have begun as to how it might get deployed.
Operator: We'll move on to the line of Armentez Chavitchez [ph].
Unknown Analyst: Yesterday, one of your peers talked about an aspirational goal of doubling their AFFO per share by 2017. And I think one of the things that the Street struggles with is keeping your leverage target, particularly in the out years. So I was hoping you could help us understand better the long-term capital allocation, how acquisitions, buybacks, status fits into all of that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, our primary focus has been and will continue to be portfolio growth that meets our returns. We think growing AFFO per share is preferable by growing the top line and EBITDA line. But having said that, given the strength in the organic business and the quality of our assets, we can create a lot of AFFO per share growth through buying back our stock. If we -- if the world changes on the capital market side, we would, obviously, take those changes into account and, perhaps, look to adjust our leverage levels. Today we're extremely happy and convinced that where we are levered and what our target leverage range is, is the right place to be. If we only became a stock repurchaser, we may bring that down some. But in terms of our particular aspirational goals, I mean I would, as we've talked about all along, our aspirational goal is at least 20% compounded AFFO per share growth for the foreseeable future and that clearly gives you more than a double in 5 years. And I think a good and solid component of that and where people should easily see that the way we do is by maintaining target leverage, provided the capital markets stays the same.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.
Mark DeRussy: Well, thank you, all, for joining us and we look forward to our next get-together when we report first quarter results. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark DeRussy, Director of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for SBA's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we'll discuss in this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2013, 2014 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others that affected historical results may affect future results, and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed at any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, November 5, 2013, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com. With that, I will turn it over to Brendan to comment on our third quarter results.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another great quarter on all fronts. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Total revenues were $332.1 million, up 39.2% over the year-earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $287.5 million or a 37.7% increase over the third quarter of 2012. Approximately $3 million of site leasing revenue in the quarter was non-recurring and was comprised of fees for temporary equipment placement. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including the impact of the TowerCo acquisition, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2012, and our initial Brazil acquisition, which closed at the end of 2012. iDEN-related churn had a negative impact of $1.5 million. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue continues to come from the U.S. and its territories with approximately 7% of total leasing revenue in the quarter coming from international operations. The impact of changes in Canadian and Brazilian exchange rates during the quarter versus our guidance was de minimis. Site leasing segment operating profit was $219.5 million or an increase of 35.3% over the third quarter of 2012. Notwithstanding a record services quarter, site leasing still contributed substantially all, or 96%, of our total segment operating profit. Tower cash flow for the third quarter of 2013 was $211.7 million or a 35.8% increase over the year-earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 78.2% compared to 79.3% in the year-earlier period. Sequentially, and adjusted for non-recurring revenue, tower cash flow margin increased 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2013. We continue to experience strong leasing demand, both domestically and internationally. Amendment activity continues to be strong. And new lease activity continues to trend higher. New collocation leases contributed just over 1/2 of our new leasing revenue added this quarter for the whole company, and just under 50% domestically. This is up from about 30% in the second quarter. The big 4 U.S. carriers contributed approximately 80% of our consolidated incremental leasing activity in the quarter. We have a solid leasing backlog and expect a strong finish in 2013 and a strong start to 2014. Our services revenues were $44.6 million compared to $29.8 million in the year-earlier period, reflecting generally higher activity levels and work mandated to us by our Sprint Network Vision contract and T-Mobile 4G agreement. Services segment operating profit was a record $9.4 million in the third quarter compared to $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2012. Services segment operating profit margin was 21% compared to 15.8% in the year-earlier period. SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $21.8 million, including noncash compensation charges of $4.1 million. SG&A expenses were $17.6 million in the year-earlier period, including noncash compensation charges of $3.6 million. Our overhead efficiency continues to improve as we grow. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 6.6%, a decline of 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $203.7 million or a 39% increase over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 64.6% in the third quarter of 2013 compared to 64.7% in the year-earlier period. Strong organic margin expansion from our leasing segment was slightly offset by the inclusion of the less mature TowerCo and Brazil towers, and an increase in our lower margin services revenue. Adjusted for non-recurring revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin did increase 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of 2013. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 44.2% to $134.3 million compared to $93.1 million in the third quarter of 2012. AFFO per share increased 36.8% to $1.04 compared to $0.76 in the third quarter of 2012. Net income to SBA Communications Corporation during the third quarter was $21.5 million compared to a net loss of $52.4 million in the year-earlier period. Net income for the quarter was positively impacted by a $6.9 million gain on the mark-to-market of the company's currency hedge entered into in connection with the previously announced Oi acquisition, and a gain of approximately $27.3 million on the sale of a bankruptcy claim against Lehman Brothers related to a hedge terminated in 2008. Net income per share for the third quarter was $0.17 compared to a net loss of $0.44 per share in the year-earlier period. Quarter-end shares outstanding were 128.1 million. In the third quarter, we acquired 279 tower sites and the rights to 4 additional communication sites for $91.1 million in cash. SBA also built 73 towers during the third quarter. We ended the quarter with 17,889 owned towers. 14,915 of these towers are in the U.S. and its territories and 2,974 are in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2013 were $124.8 million, consisting of $4.7 million of nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $120.1 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the third quarter includes $91.1 million incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, excluding working capital adjustments and paid earn-outs. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $14.3 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress, $1.2 million related to the purchase of new offices and $13 million for gross augmentations and tower upgrades. Of the $13 million augmentation figure, approximately $10.9 million or 84% were simultaneously reimbursed by our customers resulting in net augmentation cash expenditures to us of $2.1 million. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $13.5 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years, the land underneath approximately 71% of all of our towers and 73% of our domestic towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 30 years. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the third quarter with $5.7 billion of total debt. We had cash, cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $243.3 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.7x. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.2x. During and subsequent to the third quarter, we paid $74.3 million in cash and issued approximately 393,000 shares of common stock to settle the warrants associated with our 1 7/8% convertible notes. We have no further obligation with regard to these notes and the related warrants. As of the end of the third quarter, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 4.3%. And our weighted average maturity is 5 years. We currently have no outstanding balance under our revolver. And the full $770 million in commitments is available to us. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter, and currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As you have heard, we did have a great quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance across almost all key financial metrics. Once again, we led our industry in many important growth metrics. Our organic leasing activity has been particularly strong this year and the primary reason for our outperformance. We are experiencing strong demand across our entire portfolio, both domestic and international. We are seeing the benefits from that demand in both our leasing and services segments. We expect to benefit from these elevated levels of activity for the next several years as carriers build out their initial coverage footprints for 4G to be followed by capacity spending as consumer adoption increases. Commentary from our customers has been very clear that network speed and quality is now and will remain a primary focus. The path to better network speed and quality is more infrastructure. And we are seeing the results in our executed new leasing business and backlogs. We are seeing increasing amounts of cell splitting in the U.S. And our new tenant backlog is at an all-time high. Having said that, we have just experienced another wave of amendment applications, which has pushed our amendment backlog to a 2013 high. Internationally, we are seeing strong growth in new cell sites with a lot of basic 3G coverage builds still ongoing in our markets. We look forward to the buildout of 4G in many of our international markets in the future. As a result of anticipated continued strong demand from our U.S. and international customers, we're guiding to strong organic leasing growth again in 2014. In the third quarter, we had a very busy quarter with respect to new leasing business. And we signed up the highest number of new tenant leases in years. In addition to an increased of volume of new leases, our customers are requesting larger equipment loads, which have a favorable impact on rate. AT&T and Verizon continue to be very busy and represented well over 1/2 of our new business in the quarter. Both customers were active with new leases and amendments. We saw another material contribution from Sprint due to its Network Vision project. And T-Mobile remains active on its 4G upgrade. We have not yet seen any 2.5G business from Sprint, although we expect to see material activity in 2014. Our services segment produced another record level of activity for us in the third quarter, once again with the primary contributors being the Sprint Network Vision and T-Mobile 4G projects. We expect continued strong services segment contribution for the remainder of 2013 and through 2014, although we expect that our 2014 outlook reflects our work on the Sprint Network Vision project tapering off as the work we were contracted to perform nears completion. We expect Sprint to stay very busy with leasing activity. We continue to see strong activity in our international markets. Leasing activity is mostly new leases, but there is a growing amount of amendment activity. We had a busy quarter-end in Brazil. We closed on the acquisition of an independent tower company with a quality employee force and a sizable new build backlog. The transaction closed at the end of September. The integration is going well. And we now have about 30 experienced employees in Brazil ready to close and integrate our pending 2,113-tower Oi acquisition. We will continue to expand our Brazilian workforce as we grow, but with much of our back-office functions located in the U.S. We expect our Brazilian overhead to grow in the future at a fraction of the rate of growth we expect in Brazilian revenue. With our leverage currently below our target range of 7.0x to 7.5x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, and at the low end of the target range pro forma for the Oi transaction, we are seeking additional portfolio growth. We will look both domestically and internationally and believe that we will continue to find attractive opportunities that will meet our investment requirements. We are reaffirming our goal of 5% to 10% portfolio growth in 2014, while maintaining our target leverage levels. Our initial 2014 guidance reflects a lower percentage of portfolio growth, reflecting only those acquisitions we have under contract today. And if we are successful in consummating some additional acquisitions, I would expect our initial 2014 outlook to increase. Our access to capital and balance sheet are both in great shape. Our undrawn $770 million revolver and anticipated AFFO generation are more than sufficient to fund pending investment activity. If we pursue additional investments, as is our goal, those would likely be funded with additional debt financing, which is currently readily available to us at attractive rates. With respect to our expected obligations related to our 4% convertible notes due October 2014, our outlook contemplates a $1.4 billion debt refinancing to fully cash settle the convert obligations, and to call the remaining $244 million of our 8.25% senior notes. We anticipate seeking such refinancing in the secured and securitized markets and have assumed a 4% refinancing rate in our 2014 outlook. As our initial 2014 guidance indicates, we expect the current strength in our business to continue into 2014. A primary driver of the substantial growth we expect to set forth in our initial 2014 outlook is strong same tower cash revenue growth similar to 2013, which we expect to finish the year in the 9% to 10% range before iDEN terminations. We see a tremendous amount of amendment activity again in 2014 at an increased number of new leases. We have included no material contribution in 2014 from any customer that was not reasonably active in 2013. So that would exclude DISH and Public Safety. We are anticipating in our services outlook some Sprint 2.5G activity, although not in our leasing outlook. Please keep in mind that our 2014 outlook reflects site leasing revenue on a GAAP basis, while our tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO outlooks are all on a cash basis. Total noncash leasing revenue in 2014 is estimated to be approximately $43 million compared to $66 million in 2013, a $23 million difference. As is our custom, our outlook includes only those towers we own, intend to build or have under agreement to acquire as of today. And we do not guide to any stock repurchases. As a result, we are today, including in our initial 2014 guidance a level of discretionary capital investment well below 2013 levels and well below our guided AFFO. As I mentioned earlier, it will be our goal to invest additional material amounts of capital in portfolio growth or perhaps stock repurchases or both. Assuming the one refinancing contemplated in our outlook ahead of the maturity of our 2014 convertible notes, we will have significant liquidity that could be deployed for additional asset growth and/or stock repurchases. Based on our estimated 2014 year-end run rate adjusted EBITDA, we could invest approximately an additional $800 million into portfolio growth and still maintain our target net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage levels. In the aggregate, we believe our initial 2014 outlook is strong with potential opportunities for improvement throughout the year. Our focus next year is straightforward: execute well against the favorable macro environment, add quality growth assets and continue to take advantage of what is expected to be a favorable financing market. We expect to once again, produce material growth across a number of key metrics, including growth in AFFO per share. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. Our employees work really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. Our employees do a great job. Our customers recognize that. And as a result, we are a preferred provider for our customers' network needs. Our customers are and we think will remain, extremely busy improving and expanding their wireless networks. We look forward to continued success as we finish this year and move into 2014. Rochelle, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I had 2 questions, if I could, Jeff or for Brendan. First is on portfolio growth and the goals that you have for 5% to 10%. Obviously we've been watching the valuations in the sector for these types of large deals at least creep up, we saw 21x for the GTP business, we saw 22x for the AT&T tower business in terms of EBITDA multiples on run rate performance. And I was wondering if you kind of look at that as an obstacle to growing your business at an accretive rate. On the other hand, do you see that as an opportunity to comp yourself to those types of deals? And then the second question I had was just quick on some of the comments you made, Jeff, around Sprint. It just was a little fuzzy to me. It sounds like you're expecting there to be a tapering off of the Network Vision spending from Sprint in the 2014 guidance. You also expect there to be new spending on the 2.5-gig rollout, but you haven't included that in your forward-looking guidance. If you could just fill that one up for me, it'll be great.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. Let me take the last one first, Dave. Our Sprint Network Vision activity was the result of the kind of master negotiation that we did with Sprint a couple of years ago. And it involved on all of our towers taking out CDMA equipment, adding in a whole new array of CDA -- CDMA equipment. So a lot of work. What the 2.5G work will -- it will be less than that on a per job basis because what we expect will happen will be Sprint will add to its existing mounting heights several antennas, which will still be still a nice job for us, but it won't have the same magnitude that the CDMA kind of rip-and-reinstall project had. And the reason we haven't included any leasing in our -- from 2.5G in our 2014 outlook is until Sprint actually decides what they're going to do, there will be some cases where we get additional leasing revenue, where they no longer have any additional capacity under the agreement we signed. But where they do have some capacity and they can fit that in, we may not see any additional leasing revenue on that particular site. So we're going to wait until we get a little bit clearer picture of the leasing activity before we roll it into guidance. Does that make sense?
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, that's clear.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Okay, good. On the pricing, first, I would certainly agree with your comment that the prices that have been paid recently certainly underscore the value that we're creating here at SBA. And it just makes our underwriting and our working to find these opportunities that much more stringent. There are still plenty of opportunities out there in both the U.S. and the international markets where we're very confident that we can pursue, hit our goals and still return double-digit IRRs in the U.S. and growing 300 to 500 basis points from there in the international markets. We have to work a little bit harder, but there's plenty of opportunities out there for us to accomplish those goals.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: You folks have mentioned that looking at sort of 2014, you're going to be opportunistic around some potential opportunities for adding additional towers. Clearly, we've seen some of the larger deals take place recently in the domestic market. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of what types of opportunities you're seeing in the international arena in terms of bolstering your tower portfolio?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we think there will be more larger transactions available in the international markets where you will continue to see some carrier divestitures that, again, for the right opportunities and with the right returns, we would be interested in. We are continuing to focus our primary efforts in the Western Hemisphere, in the Americas. But having said that, Amir, if you look at what we have under contract today, and you back out 2,113 Oi towers, the rest of our backlog is all in the United States. So there remains a lot of 5, 10, 20, 50-tower opportunities, which of course has always been our bread and butter and an area that we remain very active in and expect to continue to do so.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then I guess, building upon the prior question, are a lot more tower opportunities perhaps, even smaller ones coming to market given some of the valuations we've seen from a deal perspective, i.e. our folks now intrigued about perhaps, unloading their tower opportunities given where valuations are in the marketplace. And do you see a disparity between international sort of valuation of some of these assets versus the domestic valuations?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, in general, you are -- we are able to find lower pricing on a multiple to tower cash flow in the international markets. I don't know that any one is rushing to sell today, notwithstanding some of the valuations that have been posted because while you may have that as one motivation, I think a lot of people share our views, our positive views about the future and the ability to put additional tenants and revenues on their towers. So I think it's a balance.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then if I may, one last question. We have gone, I believe, from you folks and some other folks in the industry that there still seems to be some challenges when it comes to capacity, be it hiring enough folks to do some of the installs that we've seen taking place, given the amount of activity taking place in the domestic market. I was wondering if you could give us sort of an update there? Are you seeing a little bit easing capacity in terms of getting enough tower climbers and so forth in order to meet the demand that you're seeing in the marketplace?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It's still tight. And we expect that, that will cause some of the work that our customers would've liked to have gotten done in 2014 to spill into -- or 2013 to spill into 2014. Even though we've had a record year and expect to finish with a record year in services, we could've actually done better if we had more people. I don't know how much more, but it would've been more. So you do still have some of that dynamic in the marketplace.
Operator: And next question from the line of Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.
Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: From a high level, one of the questions that comes up a lot is what's the best way for a tower portfolio to grow in terms of mix. Is it urban, suburban exposure versus rural? Is it the exposure to certain tenants? Is it the number of tenants per tower? Jeff, what are you seeing today as the characteristics that you think put a tower portfolio in the best position to grow? Or is there just an element of luck in this where you got those locations in that 1 year that your customers want, you end up doing better. If you can help us think about where you are on that today in terms of this philosophy for the portfolio?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, you have to have good locations, Mike, whether it's urban, suburban or rural. So you might call that luck. We hope that -- experience and skill that have led us to those good sites. I think our portfolio is perhaps less urban than some others. And we have consciously -- I mean that decision and that focus goes all the way back to mid-90s when we first got into this business with the belief that the big 4 U.S. customers would deploy and provide services on a nationwide basis. And that has proven true. And that has really been, I think, a big source of our success. I mean, in terms of tenant mixes, while there's a lot of other contributors out there, smaller Internet providers, you have a fair amount of government providers in both the U.S. and the international markets. We make decisions based off where we think the primary wireless service providers in those markets will be. So in the U.S., it's the big 4. In Brazil, it's the big 4. In Costa Rica, it's the big 3. And that's how we -- that is the basis upon which we want to build a portfolio.
Operator: And next question from the line of Colby Synesael of Cowen.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. Two questions, if I may. There's recent comments from Verizon and Sprint that they are pretty content with their current tower portfolio in terms of the amount of towers that they have. And obviously, there's still a lot of talk from the tower operators about cell-splitting and the growth that you expect from that. I was wondering if you could kind of just tie to those 2 together and explain how we could still see significant cell splitting based on the comments from Verizon and Sprint recently. And then the second question just has to do with additional churn beyond iDEN. I was just wondering, do you think it's too early to start being -- thinking about potential for 2G churn as we move into 2014 and 2015? And is there a way to kind of look at what perhaps happened in the industry in the past to kind of get a sense of when that might start to be a more meaningful impact?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. I'm not exactly sure of the Verizon comments. I know that they've made comments about not selling their towers. I don't know that they've -- I have not heard that they said that they're content with their number of cell sites.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, at a recent sell side event, they indicated that the 42,000 or 44,000 towers, I can't remember the number, that they're pretty content maintaining that number for the next few years.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, all I can tell you is what we're experiencing, which is very good demand for new cell sites from particularly the big -- from AT&T and Verizon in the U.S. and we think in the future also, T-Mobile and Sprint. And it really gets back to the fundamentals of the business, which is that with limited spectrum and the increasing needs and demands of consumers and the desires to put forth more services and faster speeds, there's really no other way other than through additional infrastructure. And that kind of basic connection has held true ever since we've been in the business. And I'm sorry, your second question?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: 2G churn. 2G churn.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: What has happened historically is as customers have migrated and basically reduced or, in fact, turned off technologies, they keep that equipment space and use it for other equipment. So we don't really anticipate that as companies move through 2G. What they'll do is they'll redeploy equipment in those spaces that will be 4G or 4G-advanced focused.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: And maybe I can make one comment on that just to clarify how our agreements are structured. As the carriers have migrated to the 3G and 4G technologies, they've amended existing contracts that we had that were originally in place for their 2G installation. And they don't have the ability to simply pull out their 2G equipment and reduce their rent based on the way our contracts are structured. So we have one agreement that covers their entire rights. And it's not set up with piecemeal pricing.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. And I would just close by saying that the increased loads, Colby, that we're seeing on these new leases would indicate that, that is not really going to be a concern.
Operator: Next question from the line of Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I'm going to ask for a little more clarity around the Sprint stuff as well, and just to make sure we're being clear here. It does sound like from Sprint, that they have this 55,000 cell site portfolio, which seems to be comprised of 38,000 sites that represent the core of Network Vision and to call it 17,000 that they essentially acquired from Clearwire. And it also seems that most, if not all, of those sites are likely going to see a tri-band installation over the next 2 years. So when you are previously discussing your Sprint agreement, and you gave some clarity around the extent to which it will or not see increased leasing on the additional loading. Was that just for the 38,000 sites? I'm just wondering how the Clearwire sites factor into the agreement you have with Sprint and the opportunity to gain amendment revenues as they put tri-band gear on those towers?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, it applies to all of it, Brett, and let me be real clear. Every touch of our towers that Sprint will do, whether M&A-ed or from a traditional Sprint site or a Clearwire site, we will have the opportunity to do the services work for that 2.5G installation. So that's every single one.
Benjamin R. Lowe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And what about amendment revenues? Because it sounds like the original Sprint...
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, let me get to that. Let me get to that. So the amendment revenue will be dictated by whether Sprint has any remaining capacity under the deal that we cut 2 years ago, the master deal that dealt with all kinds of things, including the iDEN terminations. So to the extent they have additional space that they can fit their 2.5G antennas in there, we will get the services work, but we won't get the leasing work. Now on the legacy Clearwire sites, that should result in some additional leasing revenue for us in almost every case. But we don't want to roll that in until we actually see it.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's fine. I just want to understand the difference between Clearwire and Sprint. And just one last question. You issued some shares this quarter to satisfy the warrants. You still have some authorization under the buyback. Are you thinking about maybe taking those shares back out of the market?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we're going to see how we do in portfolio growth. We're very committed in light of the environment in our organic growth and the debt markets to maintain target leverage at 7 to 7.5 turns. We'd like to fill that up through portfolio growth, but to the extent we conclude that we can't find the right opportunities there. We would certainly expect to turn our attention back to stock repurchases.
Operator: And next question from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: A few, if I may. First, you guys were kind enough to break out what the iDEN churn was in the quarter. And I was just wondering how the pacing of iDEN churn so far has matched up to your original forecast. And I know that for both this year and next year, you've sort of taken the most conservative approach in terms of order of magnitude and timing of iDEN churn. Secondly, it appears just based on commentary from a new cell site perspective that SBAC may be a little bit later in terms of the conversion to new cell sites from amendments. And historically, we've thought about SBAC as sort of receiving some of the benefits of network upgrades a little bit later. I just wanted to get your perspective on whether this also implies that maybe the high growth portion of your curve will extend a little bit further than some of your peers. And then finally, Jeff, you broke out some of the cash numbers, noncash numbers rather, around leasing. And it looks like, on a cash basis, you're expecting leasing to grow at about 12% site leasing next year. And your initial guide for AFFO growth is maybe 13%, 14%. And I was just wondering how we might think about the conversion of site leasing growth into AFFO growth?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Brendan, do you want to do the iDEN question?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, sure. Jonathan, with regard to what has happened for this year, we went into the year with an expectation of about $6 million of negative impact to our revenue numbers from iDEN churn. That was a worst-case scenario. It's going to end up approximately $4.5 million for the year based on the actual notifications we got. And that's simply because Sprint did not terminate the highest dollar leases first, although they did maximize their rights in terms of number of leases. For next year, the impact, as we mentioned, is $17.2 million on the full-year '14 guidance. And that's, again, assuming the worst case in terms of the timing and number of leases and dollar amounts or rent rates of those leases. If it turns out to be closer to the average, it would be approximately $1 million or so less than that $17 million.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: On the timing issue, Jonathan, we feel very good about continued years of activity. If you look at where our portfolio is today, we're probably, with the big 4, just over 50% amended for 4G and with the recent flurry of activity we had just in the last month or so on amendment backlog, that really gives us the expectation that, that number's going to continue to move substantially higher over the years. So the positioning that we have and the behavior and the rollout characteristics of our customers certainly gives us good confidence that we still have a fair amount of runway left for the full initial 4G amendment cycle. And then of course, you have capacity after that. And then finally, on the AFFO, I think the leasing revenue, remember when you do that, you have to take into account the iDEN terminations and all that to get a true growth rate perspective. And I think you will see that drop down almost entirely to the AFFO line. But what is also impacting the AFFO line next year is our contemplated $1.4 billion refinancing. And there's going to be some additional interest that goes along with that.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: That makes a lot of sense. I know that everybody's MLAs with Sprint differ. I'm just wondering if there were any sort of penalty clauses with your MLA with Sprint if they don't proceed according to the initial plan?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, there are requirements on both sides that would have some consequences if they're not met. I don't know that -- there is a -- I don't know if you're asking about a drop-dead date? There is that situation where whether they install their Network Vision upgrade or not, by a certain date, they are required to start paying the rental increase. I'm not sure if that's what you're referring to, Jonathan.
Operator: And next question from the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I think you referenced TowerCo earlier in the comments. I wonder if you could just review some of the recent acquisitions and how they're trending versus your expectations. And then we did see Crown elect early REIT conversion. Have you had any more thoughts about maybe following them?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. We are very, very happy with our Mobilitie and TowerCo acquisitions, Simon, particularly in light of some of the more recent transactions that really demonstrate the value in our sector. So we think we created tremendous value there. And they both happen to be trending ahead of plan and I'm most thankful to say, and you might recall that our theory behind those transactions was, that they were underrepresented with AT&T and Verizon, and would be strong candidates for cell-splitting and capacity infill. And those towers are on a kind of a per tower basis, leading our pack in that regard. So we're extremely pleased with the way all that was going. On the REIT front, I think there are a number of good reasons to convert to a REIT. And at some point in time, we will clearly -- we will definitely be a REIT. That is our intention. I personally think that to maximize our life as a REIT, we need to be paying a healthy dividend. And while we're currently compounding our AFFO per share the way that we are, we think it makes more sense to reinvest the proceeds. And we think that currently is the better way to create shareholder value. So while I think we'll get there eventually, I'm not sure that, that REIT election or announcement similar to what our peer did is imminent from us.
Operator: And the next question is from the line of Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP: This is Spencer Kurn in for Jonathan. I think we just talked about cash and leasing revenue growth looking in the 16% range for '14. Can you just clarify what your expectations are for organic growth?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we think it's going to be similar to the 9% to 10% before iDEN terminations that we're experiencing or expect to experience here in 2013.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP: Got it. And just to touch on the Sprint topic a little bit more. You've forecasted iDEN churn and no 2.5 deployments. Can you touch on what you're expecting for the rest of Sprint portfolio in terms of growth? Are you -- have you forecast any incremental site builds for their core sites?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Very little. We do have some Sprint growth in our numbers which emanates from the deal that we cut 2 years ago, where they're still deploying Network Vision equipment, and we get certain benefits and revenue recognition from that. And as Brendan mentioned earlier, I believe by the end of '14, we will start to accrue all the benefits from that transaction. So yes, we do have some of that in our guidance. But what I think is more interesting is we have seen a number of instances where Sprint has deployed new cell sites and also deployed equipment outside their allotted bucket in their agreements. And that has resulted in additional revenue opportunities for us. And we think that, that will continue into 2014.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP: Got it. And I think that going for the first half of this year, we were talking about organic growth in sort of the 8.5% range. And now it seems like you're talking about organic growth in the 9% to 10% range. What's been the major driver of that? Has it been this equipment deployment that's outside of the scope of the original MLAs? Or has it been something else?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: No, I think it's a wide range of things. The customers are just very busy. And they -- I believe they'll continue to stay busy. A lot of the commentary from our customers this quarter was around investment in the network and the desire and the need to continue to invest in the network. And it's really from a whole variety of things that has call us this performance on the organic side. I wouldn't single out any one thing.
Operator: And the next question is from the line of Michael Bowen of Pacific Crest.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: First question I have is on the iDEN negative impact of $17.2 million. Jeff or Brendan, how should we think about that in the first quarter of '14? Is that going to be a step function up? Because I think you said this quarter was $1.5 million? Or is it going to be more of a gradual increase to get to that $17.2 million? And then second question, Sprint also made some commentary outside of their 2.5-gig coverage. They said they're going to move to 250 million of POP coverage for LTE, even excluding the 2.5. So is that included in your '14 guidance?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Michael, on the Sprint question, it is essentially a step function. And basically, what it amounts to is the highest potential loss in Q1, which would be a little over $2 million in the first quarter of quarterly revenue. And then you would have that loss, obviously, for the entire year. So that component of it would be $8 million of the $17 million. And then the next quarter, you'd have a loss and so on. And so the $17 million is basically the accumulation of the total revenue to be recognized -- or to not be recognized, I should say, during 2014 associated with losing those leases.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: And on the specific inclusion of additional Sprint POP coverage, Michael, no, we -- that really didn't go into our 2014 outlook.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] You have a question from the line of Ric Prentiss of Raymond James.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions for you guys. First, Jeff, you mentioned that the Sprint Spark or the 2.5 gigahertz, you'd put it in when there was better clarity, given Sprint just announced it last week, but wants to have 100 million POPs covered by the end of '14, is this something you think we see within 3 months, 6 months as far as you getting clarity? I'm just trying to gauge how soon they've got to kind of get to you guys?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes. I think, Ric, given the timing of when we would talk about fourth quarter because it's a little bit later than the typically 1 to 3 quarter calls. We probably should have some more color next time we talk.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: That makes sense. We've also been picking up a lot of buzz in the industry, including a related company to Sprint about third-party gear again back to the old kind of LightSquared concept. It seems to be picking up a lot of buzz again that when we asked the Sprint-related company, they said that's one of the prime reasons they had done Vision was to be prepared for a third-party hosting. Can you update us a little bit about what that means for you guys, what if Sprint were to host third parties, what if they were to put some frequencies that they don't own into their equipment, how does that kind of play out?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Well, we did go down that track pretty far with LightSquared. So we had previously negotiated an arrangement where Sprint would have had that right and we would have gotten additional revenue for that. And it was equipment-specific. We had a detailed spec that we negotiated from. So the basic concept and theory is in place. And we're -- I think we'd be open and ready if that opportunity comes again, that it would clearly result in additional revenue to us because -- on the basis that Sprint would not own that spectrum.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Great, makes sense. And then on your backlog, I think I heard you say that there's about 200 or so towers in the first quarter of '14, M&A backlog, and those were U.S. Can you talk a little bit about what you're buying there? It looked a little expensive on a price per tower basis maybe.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. These are some real quality towers that average probably 2.5 tenants or more a tower. So these are a little more on the pricier side because their cash flows are much greater.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Makes sense, makes sense. And then on the organic growth that you've been talking to, is there a differentiation between the U.S. cash organic growth rate and the international organic growth rate?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It's a little bit less, less than 100 basis points off of our range in the U.S. and probably 200, 300 maybe 400 basis points more internationally. The 9% to 10% was a blend.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Right. So the U.S. would be more like 8% to 9% or 9-ish in the international or be above that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue. Back to you, gentlemen.
Mark DeRussy: Great. Thanks, Rochelle, and thank you all for joining us today with our third quarter results. And we look forward to our year-end call in February. Thank you.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And that concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Finance, Mr. Mike -- Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2013 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, August 2, 2013, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and the other information required by Regulation G, has been posted on our website, sbasite.com. With that, I will turn it over to Brendan to comment on our second quarter results.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another great quarter on all fronts. We were at the high end of our guidance for leasing revenue and exceeded the high end of our guidance for services revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Total revenues were $324.3 million, up 41.6% over the year-earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $279.5 million, or a 37.4% increase over the second quarter of 2012. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including the impact of the TowerCo acquisition, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2012, and our Brazil acquisition, which closed at the end of 2012. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue continues to come from the U.S. and its territories, with approximately 7% of total leasing revenue in the quarter coming from international operations. Site leasing segment operating profit was $211.7 million, or an increase of 33.3% over the second quarter of 2012. Notwithstanding our record services quarter, site leasing still contributed substantially all, 96%, of our total segment operating profit. Tower cash flow for the second quarter of 2013 was $203.9 million for a 33.8% increase over the year-earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 77.6% compared to 79.3% in the year-earlier period. As expected, year-over-year margins were slightly impacted by the addition of the less mature TowerCo and Brazil portfolios, but they are moving in the right direction. Sequentially, tower cash flow margin increased 80 basis points from the first quarter of 2013. We continue to experience strong leasing demand, both domestically and internationally. Amendments continue to be numerous and contributed the majority of U.S. leasing revenue added in the quarter, although we are seeing an increasing contribution from new leases for macro sites. Most of these amendments were LTE-related. The big 4 U.S. carriers contributed approximately 87% of our consolidated incremental leasing activity in the quarter. We have a solid leasing backlog and expect that the third quarter will be another strong one in terms of customer activity. Our services revenues were $44.8 million compared to $25.6 million in the year-earlier period, reflecting generally higher activity levels and work mandated to us by our Sprint Network Vision contract and T-Mobile 4G agreement. Services segment operating profit was $8.9 million in the second quarter compared to $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2012. Services segment operating profit margin was 19.8% compared to 16.1% in the year-earlier period. SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $21.5 million, including noncash compensation charges of $4.9 million. SG&A expenses were $17.7 million in the year-earlier period, including noncash compensation charges of $3.8 million. Our overhead efficiency continues to improve as we grow. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 6.6%, a decline of 110 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $196.4 million, or a 37.5% increase over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.9% in the second quarter of 2013 compared to 65.6% in the year-earlier period. Strong organic margin expansion from our leasing segment was slightly offset by the inclusion of the less mature TowerCo and Brazil towers and an increase in our lower margin services revenue. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 35.9% to $129.5 million compared to $95.3 million in the second quarter of 2012. AFFO per share increased 28.2% to $1 compared to $0.78 in the second quarter of 2012. AFFO for the second quarter includes a nonrecurring benefit of $500,000 for coupon interest expense not required to be paid upon conversion of our 1 7/8 convertible notes. AFFO for the first quarter of 2013 included a similar benefit in the amount of $3.6 million. Net loss attributable to SBA Communications Corporation during the second quarter was $35.9 million compared to a net loss of $53.5 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the second quarter was $0.28 compared to $0.44 per share in the year-earlier period. Quarter end shares outstanding were $127.8 million. During the quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real, slightly more than what was anticipated in our guidance. This negatively impacted our leasing revenue, tower cash flow and EBITDA by approximately $300,000, $150,000 and $100,000, respectively. In the second quarter, we acquired 44 tower sites and the rights to 6 additional communication sites for $36.4 million in cash. SBA also built 80 towers during the second quarter. We ended the quarter with 17,587 owned towers. 14,903 of these towers are in the U.S. and its territories, and 2,684 are in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2013 were $81 million, consisting of $3.9 million of nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $77.1 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the second quarter includes $36.4 million incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, excluding working capital adjustments and paid earn-outs. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $18 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress, and $11.8 million for gross augmentations and tower upgrades. Of the $11.8 million augmentation figure, approximately $10.6 million, or 90%, were simultaneously reimbursed by our customers, resulting in net augmentation cash expenditures to us of $1.2 million. These reimbursed amounts are treated as deferred revenue and amortized into site leasing revenue and, therefore, AFFO over the initial lease term. The amortization benefit in the second quarter from these reimbursed amounts was $3.1 million. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $14.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of all of our towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 30 years. On July 15, we announced we had entered into a definitive agreement with Oi, under which we will have exclusive use rights for 2,113 towers in Brazil. The purchase price is payable in Brazilian reais and is approximately BRL 687 million. We have hedged the conversion of the U.S. dollars to fund the transaction at an exchange rate of BRL 2.29 to USD 1. We anticipate the transaction to close at year end 2013. For the full year 2014, we anticipate these towers will generate revenue and tower cash flow of BRL 73.5 million and BRL 67.3 million, respectively. At this point, I'll turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the second quarter with $5.7 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $231 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7x, and our long-term leverage target remains 7x to 7.5x. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.1x. In April, we issued several tranches of Secured Tower Revenue Securities through our existing SBA Tower Trust, generating a total of $1.33 billion in gross proceeds. The offering had a weighted average coupon of 3.22% and a weighted average maturity of 7.2 years. Net proceeds from the offering were used primarily to: repay the $100 million outstanding balance under our revolver; to repay $500 million on a pro rata basis across our 2 outstanding term loan Bs; and to retire our 1 7/8 convertible notes. At the end of the second quarter, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 4.3%, and our weighted average maturity is 5 years. 8% of our debt is floating rate, and the remaining 92% is fixed rate. We currently have no outstanding balance under our revolver, and the full $770 million in commitments is available to us. During the second quarter, we spent $23.6 million in cash to early settle a portion of the outstanding warrants scheduled to mature during the third and fourth quarters of this year, which were related to our 1 7/8 convertible notes. There were approximately 2.7 million shares underlying the settled warrants, or approximately 20% of the total outstanding warrants. We did not purchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter and currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were very strong and therefore, we are once again able to increase our 2013 outlook in a number of key metrics. The driver behind much of this increase is the organic strength of our business, which contributed to a much greater degree than portfolio growth in the first half. We are expecting greater portfolio growth in the second half of 2013, which we believe may contribute minimally to our fourth quarter financial results, but more importantly, set us up for a very strong 2014. Domestically, our leasing and services businesses continue to be driven by the big 4 U.S. carriers, all of whom are once again very busy in the second quarter with LTE deployments. While amendment activity remains strong, we are seeing an increasing number of leases for new macro sites, up from Q1, and our new lease backlog is at an all-time high. AT&T was once again our largest customer in terms of incremental revenue added, with nationwide activity consisting of both amendments and leases for new macro sites. Verizon stayed active as well, and among other things, is deploying its AWS spectrum to add LTE capacity and adding new macro sites. Sprint remains engaged in the Network Vision project and is readying for the deployment of the 2.5 gig spectrum. T-Mobile has also ramped up its LTE deployment. All in all, it's a very busy time around our tower sites. Current activity levels with the big 4 U.S. carriers remain high, and our backlogs remain solid. Because of our second quarter success, we are increasing our full year 2013 outlook for site leasing revenue, notwithstanding that we have begun to experience a loss of iDEN revenue. As expected, Sprint has exercised its permitted number of iDEN terminations for the third quarter. We expect the same for Q4, and our outlook reflects that. Sequentially, the iDEN terminations represent a site leasing revenue loss of slightly less than $2 million in Q3 compared to Q2, which is less than the worst-case scenario we modeled. In anticipation of the iDEN terminations, we have initiated a new focus on culling from our portfolio those towers with current or expected future negative tower cash flow. In the second quarter, under this effort, we decommissioned 76 towers. While this activity obviously decreases tower count, it increases tower cash flow. We had a record services quarter, generating almost $45 million in revenue, which reflects how busy our domestic customers are on network projects. Services activity in general is up, plus we have certain work mandated to us through our Sprint Network Vision and T-Mobile 4G agreements. We are expecting our busiest services year ever this year, and we have materially increased our full year services outlook as a result of those expectations. I expect this increased level of activity to spill over well into 2014, primarily as a result of the limited human resources in the industry relative to the aggregate demands and plans for additional network upgrades and expansions. Internationally, we continue to see good levels of activity in all of our markets. Activity is still primarily basic 3G rollout, with some, but still not much, 4G activity yet. We expect the high levels of customer activity we are currently experiencing in the U.S. will be recognized in our Latin American markets in years to come. We are well ahead of expectations in our international markets with both higher revenue and lower expense compared to expectations. Our international business is growing faster than our U.S. business, as you would expect, given the relative size of each. We built and acquired towers in a number of our international markets in the second quarter and ended the year with solid backlogs -- or the quarter, excuse me, with solid backlogs in all markets. We are very pleased with the returns to date on our international investments. Our international growth and contribution to our business will be accelerated with our recently announced transaction to acquire use rights for the 2,113 towers from Oi in Brazil. Upon closing this transaction and others we have under contract in Brazil, we will own or control over 3,000 towers in Brazil, firmly establishing SBA as one of the top 4 independent tower owners in the country. We believe we will acquire the Oi towers on very attractive terms, which we have provided some certainty around by entering into the currency conversion hedge that Brendan mentioned earlier. The Oi towers are spread throughout Brazil, tend to be predominantly located in the more populous areas and are of good capacity given their origins as wireline towers. They have already demonstrated good suitability for wireless use as they currently have 1.15 tenants per tower, with additional wireless demand pending. Going forward, all of our Brazilian revenue and most of our Brazilian expense will escalate based on Brazilian CPI. We believe this structure, long term, will largely mitigate unfavorable changes in the exchange rate, although we do expect some short-term reporting volatility due to changes in the exchange rate. For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain excess cash flows in Brazil to continue to grow our Brazilian business. We expect that future wireless network development in Brazil will look a lot like what we have already experienced in the U.S., and we have well positioned SBA to participate in that growth. Age demographics, population growth, current wireless absorption, wireless technologies deployed, the current state of wireless infrastructure and the relative lack of a wireline infrastructure all bode very favorably for our business in Brazil for years to come. On top of that, you have 4 large competitive nationwide carriers and a pro-development regulator. Beyond wireless, Brazil has abundant natural resources, they export more than they import, and they have a better ratio of government debt to GDP than we do here in the U.S. We believe it is a good time to invest U.S. dollars in Brazil. We like Brazil a lot and believe that its prospects over the next 10 years will come closer to rivaling our U.S. experience and success than any other market we have explored. With the anticipated closing of the Oi transaction at the end of this year, we will have once again exceeded our portfolio growth goal of 5% to 10% per year. We remain interested in further portfolio growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria, and we typically are constantly evaluating a number of opportunities in that regard. We have a strong balance sheet and access to additional capital with which to pursue additional portfolio growth. We expect that portfolio growth will remain a material contributor to our growth story. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. We've been very busy these last 3 months, and I'm proud of our efforts. Our employees work really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. Our customers are, and we think will remain, extremely busy improving and expanding their wireless networks. Our employees do a great job. Our customers recognize that. And as a result, we are a preferred provider for our customers' network needs. We look forward to continued success as we move through 2013. And with that, Tom, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Michael Rollins representing Citi Investment Research.
Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the subject of prepaid rent in terms of what you guys are seeing on activity cash-in, what the noncash amortization in revenue looks like, and how you guys are approaching the definition of AFFO with regards to this operating practice that you and your competitors participate in?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. For the quarter, Mike, we had $11-ish million of gross augmentation expense, of which 90% of that was reimbursed to our -- by our customers. GAAP requires that those reimbursements be treated as deferred revenue and spread out and amortized into site leasing revenue over the remaining term of the lease, which is typically 5 years. And as we mentioned, our amortization benefit in Q3 was $3.1 million. But if you take a step back, I mean, the bigger picture, at least from SBA's perspective, is we work hard to try and minimize augmentation dollars. Because what an augmentation really means is that you have to create additional capacity to satisfy tenant demand. We actually prefer to have capacity and buy towers and build towers so that over time, you don't have to spend money to do that. So the augmentation area is one that we worked hard to minimize, whether the amounts are reimbursed or not. And in terms of our AFFO definition, we basically have taken our GAAP net income and backed off from there. So because the amortized amounts, in this case in Q2, $3.1 million, was included in our site leasing revenue. That becomes part of our AFFO definition. We think it's an appropriate way to go. Obviously, everyone needs to understand that. It actually spreads the amount of that deferred revenue out over a long period of time. So it smooths things out. And from a cash perspective, you have already received the cash. So the 90% of the reimbursements we do have in the bank. So actually, we are amortizing into revenue, currently, amounts well below the cash we have received from our customers for reimbursement. Brendan, do you have anything you want to add to that?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: No, that's a good summary.
Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And Jeff, I'll just follow-up with one other quick question. With the recent move in interest rates, how's that affecting the pipeline of transactions in terms of the bid-ask spread? And are you seeing the move in interest rates help lower some of the valuations that you're looking at within the pipeline of potential acquisitions?
Unknown Analyst: That was my question.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: The -- yes. We are starting to see the impact of interest rate sum. It's certainly more on top of mind for us than I think some of the sellers would like, which isn't unusual. I mean, there's always that traditional lag as market dynamics change between the current state of affairs and sellers' expectations and buyers' desires. But we're obviously very mindful of what our cost of capital is, and we grow the company because, and only if, we believe it's going to be better for AFFO per share in the future than not doing a particular deal. So we do take into account all of that, Mike. But as with any other business, I would suspect that market changes, it takes a little bit of time to work itself through both buyer and seller expectations.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Barden representing Bank of America.
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: First, Brendan, with respect to the guidance and the expectation setting for the back part of the year, I think that you basically called out that the big transactions that you have announced are going to be kind of closing towards the end of the fourth quarter. Could you kind of give us a rough sense as to the quantification of what those things are going to be contributing to the fourth quarter expectation? And then second, could we go back and kind of review the iDEN relationship? I guess, we've known about the expectation that's going to be feathering into the revenue in 2014 and for a couple years beyond that for some time now, but I think that the portfolio grooming aspect is somewhat new. Could you kind of tell us kind of how this is all working?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, David. With regards to the M&A, as we mentioned in the press release and on the call, the substantial majority of what we have under contract is not actually contributing anything to our second half of the year guidance. In fact, the M&A contribution to EBITDA for the second half of the year is less than $0.5 million. So when you look at deals like Oi, for instance, which is obviously the biggest thing that we have under contract, there's no operational contribution from Oi to any of our guidance number -- numbers, with the exception, obviously, of the CapEx number. With regard to the iDEN impact, we had previously been assuming the worst-case scenario in terms of what it would do to our second half of the year guidance. As we've gotten some actual notifications from Sprint as to which leases they'd be terminating, those numbers are a little bit better than that. Basically, for the second half of the year, we're picking up approximately $1 million or so improvement versus what we had previously guided to, based on the actual leases that they're terminating versus the ones we had assumed.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: In terms of the decommissioning, David, that is something that we actually began to plan around when we did the TowerCo acquisition. As we kind of thought through maximizing the portfolio, we did a lot of engineering work, a lot of our F-engineering [ph] work. And with a certain number of those towers that were single-tenant, iDEN-only towers, we concluded that we were better off, and it was our goal to actually decommission those towers, save the expenses. In some cases, there were -- particularly in a couple of spots in Southern California and other high land-cost areas, you had some very expensive ground rents. So this really was the -- this has been in the works in terms of planning for a while and is actually a big part of the underwriting of the TowerCo transaction. It also, of course, has application to our own towers. So -- I mean, I think you ought to look at it like -- there's 15,000 towers, the substantial majority of which are all very good and leasing up. Some are not. And if you have concluded, based on years of experience, that those are not, you think, going to lease up, you go ahead and cut your expenses and improve your tower cash flow.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Richard for Phil. I just wanted to clarify a little bit on the iDEN side. Are you expecting another $2 million down sequentially for the iDEN? Or is that just the $2 million for the year?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes. We are expecting -- each quarter, Sprint has the right to terminate up to 180 leases, and we would expect that they will terminate another 180 in the fourth quarter, which would represent approximately $1.5 million sequentially down.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Compared to the prior quarter.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Compared to the prior quarter. Right.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then shifting back to, I guess, the Brazil towers, there's not much this year, but obviously, it will be added next year. Is there anything that we should be expecting in SG&A at the end of the year? Or are you already staffed enough there at the end of the year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. We'll have some SG&A pickup, but it will be relatively immaterial, certainly in relation to the amount of revenue and tower cash flow being added.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And I guess, kind of finally, is the business case around those towers just the mobile aspect of it because DirecTV and, I guess, others are looking at fixed wireless in the region? Can -- is that playing into it at all?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: The business case is primarily underwritten on wireless. But just like in the U.S., we will seek to serve and court any potential user of those towers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. First, I think one of the big questions out there is MLA versus not-MLA. You guys had done an MLA with a couple of carriers, not with some other carriers. Talk to us a little bit about what the difference is in between an MLA and not-an-MLA as we look at amendment activity moving to new collocation?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, there would be nothing covered under any MLA that we have on new collocations. The 2 MLAs that we have, 1 with Sprint and 1 with T-Mobile, deal with amendments; or in Sprint's case, the wholesale change-out of their CDMA into their Network Vision project. And it's an amount of activity that is specified by its -- limited in scope to the amount of equipment that both those companies can add in exchange for an increase in rents. And our historical position on MLAs really hasn't changed. If we can quantify and limit the amount of additional equipment that a customer would like to have subject to an MLA and we could price it appropriately, we're fine with that and as evidenced by what we did with Sprint and T-Mobile. The types of MLAs that we have avoided, and I think we'll continue to avoid, are those that are unlimited in the amount of additional equipment that may be added at a particular mounting height.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And no stock buybacks in the quarter, but obviously, the tower stocks have been a bit sluggish of late. How do you guys think about buying back stock versus the M&A portfolio growth that you're looking at, and then also how that ties back to leverage?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. I think as we had done a couple of years ago, when we didn't see relatively attractive M&A opportunities relative to our own stock price, we bought back a lot of stock. In 2011, I believe that was -- maybe '10. And we'll do the same, Rick, I mean, it's kind of a constant balance of where the stock price is versus where we think we can deploy additional capital for portfolio growth at what prices. So it's a constant mix. I think we will want to stay fully invested to our target leverage amounts. We will continue to evaluate those, if, in fact, we reach the conclusion, which we have come nowhere close to reaching, that our future investment is primarily stock repurchases versus portfolio growth. But I think we're a long way away from that. I think it's safe to assume, while we won't top off the capital structure, the desired capital structure every quarter, I think you should expect that over time, we will stay in that 7 to 7.5 turns of leverage, and we're going to do it, hopefully, first through buying good towers and building good towers, but if not, through stock repurchases.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: One quick follow-on. On the decommissioning program, the pruning, if you will, what happens? Do you have to make it -- take it back to original condition? Is there money spent to actually remove the structure? And how does that flow through the CapEx?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It's a combination of things. I mean, a lot of it is -- sometimes, you just hand it over to the landowner, at which event, there is no cost. Sometimes, you take it down to the foundation. In a few cases, you have to take it actually a little bit into the ground, and it's all very situation-specific. But in general, all those costs are run through our asset impairment line, which you see in Q2 was much bigger than it was a year ago.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: And just to be clear on that, Rick, that line, which is actually labeled Asset Impairment and Decommissioning Costs, so you can see that clearly, is not only the actual cash cost of taking down towers to the extent that we need to do that, but it includes the write-off of any carrying value associated with those towers on the books. So some of that is just a book write-off as opposed to a...
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Noncash. It's not...
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Noncash. Noncash, right
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Right.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: A lot of flag poles could be out there too, though?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: A lot of flag poles?
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Give people the American flag and just leave the tower up there.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Oh, yes. Sure. There should be all kind of uses for them, I'm sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut representing Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: First, if you could, Jeff, maybe give us a color on where we are in terms of the amendment process -- or pardon me, the upgrade process on LTE, by carrier? In the past, you've given us some color. And then secondly, as you start to see new cell site applications come in, and then I guess we'll start to see those roll into revenue towards the end of the year and next, could you give us a sense as to whether or how that could impact your growth or the economics of the business as we look into 2014?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. I think on a carrier-by-carrier basis, Jonathan, we are probably about -- well, on the aggregate, we're about at the 50% mark with, I would say, Verizon being ahead of that; AT&T being -- I'm just speaking, of course, on our towers only, I'm not speaking to where they are in terms of their entire network. I don't know that. But on our towers, it would be -- Verizon would be higher than that. AT&T would be about at those levels. Sprint's probably about at that now. They've done a lot on Network Vision over the last 2 quarters, and T-Mobile would be behind that. So we still have a ways to go. Although in terms of incremental revenue added, if you just take the amount of new revenue that came from amendments and leases, you add it together, the -- while the percentage is still on the majority side for amendments, it actually grew 10% in Q2, more for leases. So leases are starting to close the gap in terms of their revenue contribution, in terms of new activity added, which is good. I mean, that's really what we were expecting. It was a big driver, of course, behind our 2 big deals last year, that we believe that cell splitting would be the next phase of activity, and we are seeing tangible real evidence of that now. In terms of the future, I think you don't have to obviously do as many leases as you do amendments to produce the same amount of revenue growth. I kind of think about it as it will be a elongation and a perpetuation of the good leasing growth that we've had over the last several years. You'll see strong, I think, revenue adds organically from this activity. You'll start to see tenants per tower grow, which you haven't seen a lot in this primarily LTE amendment world that we've lived in now for the last couple of years. And I think that the unit economics will continue to rise on the lease side, because what we are seeing is that our customers are adding -- they're coming to us and requesting more equipment for new macro sites than we have ever seen before.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Awesome. What is your current tenants per tower?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It's about 2.0, 2.1, and that will be diluted somewhat by the Oi transaction. But that's where we are today.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery representing Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Brendan, you went through the rates that you've achieved on your debt, and fixed rate in most cases. Also, the term has been pushed out to 5 years. But I think there is still a real concern amongst some investors about the impact of rising rates now and in the future. Is 5 years the right term? Do you think that there's maybe a benefit to sort of trading or paying a slightly higher rate but getting some 7-year, 10-year-type maturity on your debt here? How do you think about that given the sort of long lives on the asset side of things?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, sure. I mean, there is certainly -- potentially some benefit at the right trade-off. If you look at the most recent financing that we just did in April, the average life on the securities that we issued was over 7 years, I believe, or 7.2 years for fixed rate debt at a cost of about 3.25% fixed. So we did, in fact, think about that when we did that issuance. There was some 10-year paper issued there. And so we will continue to look at balancing tenure with rates and try to make the best decision possible when trading that off.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: I think, Simon, the -- your point is we accept it more at the unsecured level in the high-yield market. In the CMBS market, we've done a lot -- we've been active in that over the years and done a lot of historical analysis. And to stay in that market in a succession of 5-year -- basically refinancings, the long rates would have to move tremendously given the big difference between 5- and 10-year rates in that market for it to have ever made sense to go entirely long in that market. But I think that, that reflects the secured kind of highly-rated nature of that market versus the high-yield market.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First question. You talked about macro sites and obviously that being a little bit stronger. Maybe you can help us think through. It seems like one of the biggest sources of potential here is a Sprint network up at 2.5 gigahertz and a really sort of robust nationwide network. How do you think about what that means for macro cell site potential in your network? And then second question, just on -- service margins obviously have been, both revenues and margins, trending higher. I think you talked about sort of contributors to that and how that probably extends for at least the near term. And maybe help us think through the margin profile as well. Would you expect that to continue to be elevated?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. On the 2.5G rollout, Jason, the -- a lot of it will depend on where Sprint is on our particular towers with -- in terms of their permitted Network Vision load. And in some cases, they've used up their permitted load, which will result in additional leasing revenue to us for the addition of the 2.5G equipment. And where they can squeeze it in to their existing load it won't, because it's all kind of -- it's all dictated around the prescribed equipment levels that are in our deal with Sprint. Now what was said the other day by the Sprint folks was that they not only will hit all of their Network Vision sites, but go well beyond that, given the propagation characteristics of the 2.5G. Now obviously, that's a brand-new lease. I would imagine that -- well, I don't know. But it would make sense for Sprint to -- if they're going to deploy 2.5G on more sites, that they would add the full complement of equipment to handle voice and make the most out of that cell site. So it could have some great revenue opportunities for us beyond what we've already kind of agreed to with Sprint on the Network Vision side. On the services side, it will have a very big benefit because that will also be work that comes to us on the services side on our towers. So that's going to be a big contributor, we think, in 2014. In terms of the services margins, I mean, I don't know that they're going to keep going up. They've kind of been pleasantly surprising to us for over the last couple of quarters. But we do have enough work backlog mandated to us that I think you should expect for a very healthy second half of the year in services. And given the work that will spill over and this 2.5G work that I don't believe will really even -- it may hit some in the fourth quarter, but it will be primarily a 2014 event. Yes, I think we're looking at some sustained period of time where we have some very, very good services contributions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman representing Deutsche Bank.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was hoping I can ask a little bit more about the Oi deal. It has some terminology that I don't think we've seen before, this concept of a fixed wireline concession. I'm wondering, based on the history of the towers, is there anything structurally different about them? And then also, the margins are ridiculously high. Could you help us understand why they're so profitable and if that has implications for incremental margins as you add new tenants?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: They are beefy towers that are spread throughout the country, Brett. There are a lot of microwave. They were built for a lot of microwave, so they're good, strong beefy structures. I think they'll be very little -- certainly, within our expected lease-up, to hit our investment goals, we see very little incremental capital required to support that kind of demand. And I'm sorry, your second question?
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It's the margins are very high based on the numbers you broke out.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: That's because Oi continues to pay the ground rents.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So is there any revenue sharing or -- will incremental margins be as high as you typically see?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: No. I mean, everything that we would add to these towers, you would -- you're going to see the typical 90%-plus drop-down to tower cash flow.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And do you lose rights to the towers or anything at any point in time?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: There is a -- Oi -- the towers are tied to Oi's wireline concession, which is up for renewal in 2025.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I guess with AT&T and Leap's combination, can you talk a little bit about -- I know you guys put out a release a couple of weeks ago, but talk about any impact that you contemplate for 2014? And then I guess secondly, compared to the other 2 tower companies, your tone for the second half is decidedly more positive than the other tower cos, and I know you probably won't want to speak for their businesses, but what is leading you to be this much more positive in the second half comparatively to your competitors?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, I'll speak to the last issue first. I listened to both calls. I thought they were positive about the second half. I think, from an activity level, I heard some very positive things from my peers, which we echo and see things the same way. Now how they actually book that business and how it gets accounted for, I can't speak to. But in terms of operational activity, I think I -- we're all talking about high levels of activity, is my take on the calls. Brendan, on Leap?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, we don't -- we really don't expect any impact from an AT&T/Leap merger to our 2014 numbers. We obviously haven't given any 2014 guidance, and we can cover that when we do. But given that, that deal is not happening, given the fact that the overlap exposure is approximately 75 basis points of our total rent leasing revenue associated with Leap on sites where they overlap with AT&T, any impact would be very immaterial.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Very quickly, I didn't hear much update on small cells. If you could talk to that a little bit within your business context, that'd be great.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. We continue to see and field a lot of inquiries from our customers as to small cell deployments on our existing towers and rooftops. There has not been a lot of activity yet. I believe there's a lot of issues that are still being worked out in terms of equipment, backhaul power connections, but it is a topic that is having a lot of time spent on it by our customers. And I think it will be a contributor to our business in years to come. But in terms of its contribution so far this year, there really has not been any.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP: This is Spencer in for Jonathan. AT&T and Sprint have spoken about network expansion of about 20,000 sites between the 2 of them. Can you talk about how much of this has been factored into your guidance for this year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: None, really. None. We haven't taken into account anything beyond the base Network Vision deal that we got 1.5 years ago. So all that, Jonathan, to the extent it comes to pass, will be upside. I mean, we haven't -- and I'm not -- while we will get our fair share, I'm not sure, even if we knew it today specifically, that it would be a 2013 item. But to answer the question, none -- to the answer to your question, none of that is in our 2013 number.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP: And you also talked about customers requesting to put up more equipment than ever before on your sites. Does that imply that amendments, rates have been increasing for you? If you could talk about how they've been tracking over the last few quarters and relative to your expectations, that'd be helpful.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. Amendment rates have been ticking up, reflecting greater equipment requests and loads from our customers. And compared to where we thought things would be several years ago, there -- particularly when some of these master agreements were being discussed, they're well above those levels. Currently, they're well above those levels.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: One other commentary -- some of the commentary that came out of your prepared remarks was that there does seem to be some level of capacity constraints by personnel issues, in terms of being able to meet some of the demand out there. I was wondering if you could provide some color around that and if you see any easing going into the back half of the year, where you do expect to see sort of improved demand.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It's primarily around tower climbers. There is a shortage today relative to the work that's available today of tower climbers. So what it does is it generally pushes projects back. I mean, we've factored all that into our outlook, so I don't think that our outlook is at risk because of that condition. But I do think it will cause activity levels on both the leasing and the services side to spill over into 2014, which is one of the factors that drives our optimism around the future as well.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Yes, yes, yes. I just wanted to get a little bit of color in terms of -- it seems like this does provide a fair bit of visibility in terms of the projects that should roll into 2014, which I suspect supports your strong growth expectations.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of portfolio growth, I know you had mentioned that there is some impact relative to interest rates in some of the valuations for some of the assets that you folks are looking at. I was also wondering how you guys consider sort of fluctuations in currency at the moment. We've clearly seen some volatile markets, and one could argue that, that could provide an attractive entry point for you folks when looking at some of these assets abroad. I'd love to hear sort of your thought process around that.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we agree with you. And we find ourself in that position today in Brazil with our Oi transaction. We think our entry point on a converted U.S. dollar to Brazilian reai basis is very attractive today. From an ongoing perspective, our plans are to keep the cash in Brazil for the foreseeable future to grow the business. Now the real issue will be what point in time and when do we want to convert those reais back into U.S. dollars, and where will the exchange rate be at that time? That, I suspect, will be many years off and will be a topic of continued analysis and planning here. But it's a very good time, I think, given the long-term prospects of Brazil and some of the short-term pressures that I think are causing exchange rates to be what they are today, to be an investor of U.S. dollars into Brazil. So we're very pleased to have that opportunity.
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Could we see a pickup in momentum given sort of the favorable exchange rate from an M&A perspective for you folks?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we're always looking. We like to hear -- we like to meet our annual 5% to 10% portfolio goal. We'll do it again this year, and we'll be looking to do it again next year.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research: Great. Maybe as a big-picture follow-up to that. There's been a lot of discussion among certainly REIT investors, about how to value the international assets and what kind of ROIC premium you, as a buyer, place on international? What does that mean in terms of higher required site revenue growth. And how you view sort of initial ROIC dilution from prospective transactions that may need some CapEx, or single-tenant tower portfolios that may not be generating the same kind of AFFO that a U.S. portfolio would? Maybe if you could give a little specific color on your criteria and thought process, in general, on international. And then also, do you look at aggregate risk by carrier, or country risk. Does that kind of stuff play in? Or are you just very happy with Brazil and the opportunity for cheap valuations now?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, I think the latter is definitely true, Kevin. If you look at the -- I mean, some of the risks and the negatives you mentioned, I mean, none of them are present with the Oi transaction. If you looked at what we're paying and the revenues and the tower cash flows to be generated, that's a -- on a standalone basis, that's a hugely accretive transaction to us immediately. So we really think that's a very good example of buying right and taking advantage of current exchange rates. But having said that, we do generally apply a 500-basis-point increased return requirement for our Latin American investments. And we believe that, that is an appropriate spread to U.S. investing, to take into account the risks of international investing, at least in the markets that we're focused on.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research: And does that translate into a higher site revenue growth expectation of 200, 300, 400 basis points? Or it's hard to generalize?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It either has to do that, or you have to buy it at a lower price.
Operator: Our final question today will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on the Oi transaction. When you made the acquisition of the 800 towers in Brazil back in the fourth quarter, you paid about 17x tower cash flow. And it looks like for Oi, based on the numbers you've provided, it's about 9x tower cash flow. So I'm just trying to understand what the delta is? Is it just the FX that you just alluded to? Or is it just the rights ownership structure of what's happening with Oi? Also, just tied to that, when you look at your discretionary CapEx for the year of north of $800 million, it looks like your cash position could be a little low as we move into the end of this year. Are you expecting to raise additional debt or drawdown on the credit facility? And then the last question, just a point of clarification, did you mention then that for Sprint tied to iDEN, that the 76 towers that you decommissioned in the second quarter, that, that's the end of it? There's no more to be had? Or should we expect additional decommissions as we move into the back half?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: A lot of questions there. We will have some more decommissionings going forward. Not sure how many and exactly when, but there will be some more as we continue to analyze and make appropriate culls to the portfolio. On the Oi transaction, the difference between Vivo and Oi is largely the rights structure. We don't really see any difference in the revenue growth on those towers. And -- that was 2. I know there were a couple of other questions in there. I apologize.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just wanted to get a sense of your balance sheet. It looks like your cash position could be low moving into the end of the year with all these transactions.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes. We -- I mean, at this point, we have plenty of liquidity between the cash on hand and the availability under the revolver. The full revolver is available to us. So the largest outflow that we have ahead of us is for the Oi transaction, and we may have to dip into the revolver to handle that. But between cash flow from operations, cash on hand and the revolver, we do not have to do another financing.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Great. Well, listen. We appreciate everyone's time and attention this morning, and we look forward to reporting our third quarter results in the future. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2013's earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2013 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and the risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, April 30, 2013, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Brendan to comment on our first quarter results.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Thanks, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, we had another great quarter on all fronts. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for leasing revenue, services revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Total revenues were $313.1 million, up 62.6% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $273.5 million, or a 58.2% increase over the first quarter of 2012. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by -- both by organic growth and portfolio growth, including the impact of the Mobilitie and TowerCo acquisitions, which closed during the second and fourth quarters, respectively of 2012 and our Brazil acquisition, which closed at the end of 2012. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue continues to come from the U.S. and its territories, with approximately 7% of total leasing revenue in the quarter coming from international operations. Site leasing segment operating profit was $205.4 million, or an increase of 49.4% over the first quarter of 2012. Notwithstanding a big services quarter, site leasing still contributed 96.7% of our total segment operating profit. Tower cash flow for the first quarter of 2013 was $197.1 million, or a 48.9% increase over the year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 76.8%, compared to 80.4% in the year-earlier period. As expected, margins were slightly impacted by the addition of the less mature Mobilitie, TowerCo and Brazil portfolios and the way we account for the domestic Mobilitie towers, where we calculate tower cash flow margins by recording expenses as ours and grossing up revenue by the same amount in order to reflect the triple net reimbursement of these expenses by our tenants. We continue to experience strong leasing demand both domestically and internationally. Amendments continue to be numerous and contributed the majority of U.S. leasing revenue added in the quarter. Most of these amendments were LTE-related. The Big 4 U.S. carriers contributed approximately 88% of our consolidated incremental leasing activity in the quarter. We have a solid leasing backlog and expect that the second quarter will be another strong one in terms of customer activity. Our services revenues were $39.6 million compared to $19.6 million in the year-earlier period, reflecting generally higher activity levels and work mandated to us by our Sprint Network Vision contract and T-Mobile 4G agreement. Services segment operating profit was $7 million in the first quarter compared to $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2012. Services segment operating profit margin was 17.6% compared to 14.2% in the year-earlier period. SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $20.4 million, including noncash compensation charges of $3.8 million. SG&A expenses were $17.2 million in the year-earlier period, including noncash compensation charges of $3 million. Our overhead efficiency continues to improve as we grow. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 6.5%, a decline of 250 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $187.7 million, or a 54.5% increase over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.4% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 65.9% in the year-earlier period. Strong organic margin expansion from our leasing segment was slightly offset by the inclusion of the less mature Mobilitie, TowerCo and Brazil towers and an increase in our lower margin services revenue. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA is attributable to our tower leasing business. AFFO increased 66.2% to $126.3 million compared to $75.9 million in the first quarter of 2012. AFFO per share increased 46.3% to $0.98 compared to $0.67 in the first quarter of 2012. AFFO for the first quarter includes a nonrecurring benefit of $3.6 million for coupon interest expense not required to be paid upon conversion of our 1 7/8% convertible notes. Net loss attributable to SBA Communications Corporation during the first quarter was $22.4 million compared to a net loss of $22.6 million in the year-earlier period. Net loss per share for the first quarter was $0.18 compared to $0.20 per share in the year-earlier period. Quarter-end shares outstanding were 127.3 million. In the first quarter, we acquired 41 tower sites for $20.2 million in cash. SBA also built 62 towers during the first quarter. We ended the quarter with 17,539 owned towers. 14,926 of these towers are in the U.S. and its territories and 2,613 are in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2013 were $245.2 million, consisting of $4.7 million of nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures, such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx, and $240.5 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the first quarter includes $196 million incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, including $176 million paid in January, associated with our Brazil acquisition that closed at the end of 2012. These acquisition amounts are exclusive of any working capital adjustments and paid earn-outs. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $22.6 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress, and $8.3 million for gross augmentations and tower upgrades. Of the $8.3 million augmentation figure, approximately $7.7 million or 93% were simultaneously reimbursed by our customers, resulting in net augmentation cash expenditures to us of $0.6 million. These reimbursed amounts are treated as deferred revenue and amortized into site leasing revenue and therefore AFFO, over the initial lease term, notwithstanding our having received the cash today. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate $13.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 30 years. In a moment, Mark will provide details on our balance sheet positioning and our recently completed $1.33 billion financing. A portion of the proceeds of that financing will be used to satisfy obligations associated with the conversion or maturity of our 1 7/8% convertible notes. For the sake of clarity, I'd like to take a moment to go through in detail how the settlement of the convert will work. There are basically 3 separate instruments that must be settled: the convertible notes; the purchased call options, which we typically refer to as our convertible note hedges; and the written warrants. The amount to be paid by us under the convertible notes and the amount be paid to us by our counterparties under the purchase call options are both derived from the average value of our stock over the 45-day trading period ended last Friday, April 26. This average value of our stock over this period was $73.14. Absent the failure of Lehman Brothers, one of our counterparties under the purchased call option, regardless of our stock price, we would have had to deliver, on a net basis, solely the face amount of the notes on the final settlement day. However, because the value of the Lehman call option was lost as a result of their bankruptcy, we will be making a net cash payment on May 1 of $612 million, which will fully settle the convertible notes and the purchased call options. The settlement period for the warrants is different than that of the convertible notes and convertible notes hedges. The settlement period for the warrants will begin on August 1, and they will unwind over a similar 45-trading-day period. Because the Lehman bankruptcy did not terminate the warrants, we are subject to satisfying 100% of the original warrants sold. By way of example, at a $77 stock price, we would be required to pay approximately $125 million in settlement of the outstanding warrants. This payment can be made in either cash, stock or a mix of the 2 at our election. Because there are approximately 13 million shares underlying the warrants, every $1 moved higher in our stock price will result in an additional $13 million required payment. And every $1 moved lower will result in a $13 million reduction in our required payment. Under current accounting rules, this settlement will be reported through equity, and thus, will have no impact on the company's statement of operations this year. Hopefully, this clears up any confusion that may exist around the settlement of our convert. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the first quarter with $5.4 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $153 million. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.0x, and our target leverage ratio remains 7.0 to 7.5x. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.2x. In April, we issued several tranches of secured tower revenue securities through our existing SBA Tower Trust, generating a total of $1.33 billion in gross proceeds. The offering had a weighted average coupon of 3.22% and a weighted average maturity of 7.2 years. We issued at 7.3x leverage in the trust compared to 6.7x leverage in our most recent prior financing out of the same trust last July. We are very pleased with the outcome. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the $100 million outstanding balance under our revolver and to repay $500 million on a pro rata basis across our 2 outstanding Term Loan Bs. The rest of the net proceeds we'll use to satisfy unhedged obligations required to be satisfied in connection with the conversion or maturity of our 1 7/8% convertible notes. Pro forma for the April offering, the weighted averaged coupon of our outstanding debt is 4.3% and our weighted average maturity is 5.25 years. Compared to where we were -- where we ended 2012, this transaction increased our tender by almost 1 year, reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by increasing our fixed-rate debt to 90% of total debt and kept our cash coupon essentially unchanged. Additionally, during the quarter, we increased the total commitments under our revolver from $700 million to $770 million. We currently have no outstanding balance under our revolver and the full $770 million in commitments is available to us. We did not purchase any shares of common stock during the quarter and currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results show that SBA is off to a great start in 2013. Our financial results were excellent and as a result, we are able to increase our 2013 outlook in a number of key metrics. Our revised 2013 outlook implies year-over-year growth and AFFO per share well above 20%, providing what we believe is a solid foundation for continued value creation for our shareholders. Domestically, our leasing and services business continue to be driven by the Big 4 U.S. carriers, all of whom were once again very busy in the first quarter with LTE deployments. The lease-up we executed in the first quarter exceeded our expectations and is a continuation of the increased level of customer activity that started in the second half of 2012. AT&T was once again our largest customer in terms of incremental revenue added with nationwide activity. Verizon stayed active as well and began to deploy its AWS spectrum to add LTE capacity. Verizon's AWS deployments involved different and additional equipment on the tower compared to its 700 megahertz deployments, which provides us with additional revenue opportunity. Sprint is now fully engaged in the Network Vision project. We are seeing increasing numbers of installations completed for Network Vision, which is the event that triggers the commencement of cash revenue recognition for SBA. T-Mobile has also ramped up its LTE deployment. All in all, it is a very busy time around our tower sites. In the last 4 quarters, we have processed over 7,800 monetary amendments. We would estimate that on our tenancies from the Big 4 U.S. wireless carriers, LTE has been deployed on less than 40% of our sites, which implies much remaining amendment activity. Current activity levels with the Big 4 U.S. carriers remain high and our backlogs remain solid. While current activity on an incremental revenue added basis is mostly still amendments, we are also seeing an increasing number of new leases and our new lease backlog is at an all-time high. We believe this is the very beginning of the capacity infill stage of a wireless technology rollout, which is a stage that we believe will produce customer leasing activity for an extended period of time, certainly well into 2014 at a minimum. As a result, we are increasing our full year 2013 outlook for site leasing revenue, which continues to include a second half of the year loss of $6 million of iDEN revenue, reflecting the worst-case scenario pursuant to our agreements with Sprint. Any result better than the worst-case scenario will reduce that number and we have received no termination notices yet. Our services business was a good indicator this quarter of the level of activity among our customers. We saw none of the seasonal slowness typically associated with the first quarter. We had a record services quarter, generating over $39 million in revenue. Services activity in general is up, plus we have certain work mandated to us through our Sprint Network Vision and T-Mobile 4G agreements. We are expecting our busiest services year ever this year, and we have materially increased our full year services outlook as a result of those expectations. I expect this increased level of activity to spill over well into 2014, primarily as a result of the limited human resources in the industry relative to the aggregate demands and plans for LTE deployments. Internationally, we continue to see good level of activity in all of our markets. Latin America, in particular, is projected in the latest Cisco Visual Networking Index to have a compound annual growth rate in mobile data traffic through 2017 of 67% compared to the projected CAGR in North America of 56%. We expect the high levels of customer activity we are currently experiencing in the U.S. will be recognized in our Latin American markets in years to come. Our international business is growing faster than our U.S. business, as you would expect, given the relative size of each. International leasing revenue and tower cash flow grew 89% and 77%, respectively over the year-earlier period. We built and acquired towers in a number of our international markets in the first quarter and ended the year with solid backlogs for both leasing and new builds in all markets. We are very pleased with the returns to date on our international investments. In the first quarter, we continued to focus on integrating and maximizing the towers we acquired last year and improving our tower portfolio in general. Brazil is coming along nicely with good integration progress being made on the 800 towers we acquired at year end and growing leasing demand for those assets. We built and bought a total of 103 towers in the first quarter, split approximately equally between the U.S. and international. We continue to favor portfolio growth as our preferred growth for investment, and we remain confident in achieving our annual goal of 5% to 10% portfolio growth. We are currently evaluating a number of U.S. and international tower acquisition opportunities. We intend to continue to actively pursue new build and acquisition opportunities that we believe will meet or exceed our return requirements. We have almost $1 billion of discretionary spending capacity this year, based on expected AFFO generation and our revolver availability, all while still being able to maintain our target leverage levels. Speaking of leverage, we enjoyed a material reduction in leverage in 1 quarter off the organic strength of our business. On a pro forma basis for the funding of the Brazil transaction, we started the quarter with net debt annualized EBITDA leverage of 7.5 turns and ended the quarter at 7.0 turns, a reduction of a full half turn in only 1 quarter. It is this strength in our organic growth, together with low interest rates and accommodating debt markets that continues to give us confidence around our target leverage range of 7.0 to 7.5 turns. We continue to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity within our target leverage range. As Mark mentioned, we completed our largest single financing transaction to date in April, raising $1.33 billion in 5- and 10-year notes. Through this financing, we increased our percentage of fixed-rate debt and extended our average maturities. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our $770 million revolver, which is fully available, and repaid $500 million in term loans. The collateral remaining in our secured credit facility would support a reissuance of at least that $500 million in term loans today, and more over time should we choose to seek additional debt financing. As a result, our liquidity position and prospects are excellent. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. We have been very busy these last 3 months and I'm proud of our efforts. Our employees work really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. Our customers are and we think will remain extremely busy improving and expanding their wireless networks. Our employees do a great job, our customers recognize that, and as a result, we are a preferred provider for our customers' network needs. We look forward to continued success as we move through 2013. Paul, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll start out with Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore Partners.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Two, if I may. First, Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you alluded to amendments still driving most of your business. Could you give us a little color maybe in terms of percent or something, amendments versus new cell site applications? And then secondly, I did notice that this quarter had a higher number of tower decommissionings than we've seen in the past and I was wondering if we can get a little bit more color around that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Okay. On the splits, on the new lease versus amendment revenue was approximately 80% stilted towards amendments in Q1 actual documents signed up. But our backlog has grown quite a bit on the -- on both sides, but particularly on the leasing side. And that's probably now approaching 55-45-ish, still on the amendment side, but with big gains on the full lease side of it, which gives us the perspective of around cell splitting and future business that we mentioned, Jonathan. On the decommissioning, we have a lot of towers now and we kind of took a breath in the first quarter to really to go back and take an asset optimization approach to our portfolio. And those towers were ones that were either naked or were negative cash flow, and we evaluated those and decided that we felt we'd be better off without them rather than maintaining the expense to continue to own them, and so we decommissioned them.
Operator: And next we'll move to the line of Rick Prentiss of Raymond James.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions, if I could. First, Jeff, in your guidance, can you talk to us a little bit about Clearwire? You mentioned how Verizon, AT&T, the active Sprint, T-Mobile getting active, but what are you seeing as far as Clearwire and what's in your guidance? And has anybody started moving beyond what's covered in the MLAs?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, yes, we're definitely seeing activity outside of the MLAs. So the MLAs that we have signed are very equipment-specific, and we have seen instances where we have those -- many instances where more equipment is being deployed. On the Clearwire side, we are seeing increasing levels of activity, which is probably a material jump from where Clearwire was a year ago, but not certainly to the contributory level of the Big 4. So while it is moving in a positive direction, I would not yet say that Clearwire is a primary driver for increases in our guidance. In fact, that's not why we increased our outlook. So we remain hopeful and optimistic that in the future, that will be the case.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Great. And the second question is on the pipeline for your 5% to 10% growth in the portfolio. It seemed like on the fourth quarter call, there was maybe 96 to 100 towers in the backlog as far as deals to close or letters signed. It seems to be about a similar number now. Just trying to gauge how the pipeline is maturing along and then the cost to construct seems a little higher this time. I think you mentioned maybe that was work in progress, but wanted to touch on both those items.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, the pipeline continues to be good. What you don't see and what we don't kind of announce until it's signed is what we're working on. So we are actually working on a couple of things, which is taking some time in the first quarter, which hopefully will result in some increased numbers this time next quarter. So the actual signed and closed stuff, Rick, was, you're right. It looked like whatever we had, we kind of just replaced that and didn't add to that. But that's not really the story. The story is kind of the things that we're working on that we haven't yet got the contract. I'm going to let Brendan talk about the new build costs.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, Rick. It's a mix of a couple of things. It certainly is costs associated with towers that are in progress. You can't just necessarily take the CapEx that we report in a particular quarter and divide it by the number of sites that are finished in that quarter because some of the CapEx on the sites we finished was incurred previously and some of it is related to towers that aren't complete. In addition, it's a cash CapEx disclosure, so there are certain payments in the first quarter that actually related to sites completed at the end of the fourth quarter as well. It's just a timing issue. So on average, we're still seeing our costs in the $250,000 to $275,000 range domestically and much less than that internationally.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: When you say much less, so that being kind of less than $150,000 international?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: That'd be a good number.
Operator: And next from Nomura Securities, Mike McCormack.
Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Can you just comment on PCS and T-Mobile closing? Do you think you'll see further acceleration once that deal is closed? And then secondly, maybe some commentary on the competitive landscape in Brazil, particularly around 4G network sharing?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: The PCS-T-Mobile deal did close. The Metro represented slightly less than 3% of our aggregate run rate revenue. The overlapping mix there between T-Mobile and Metro where they're on the same tower, Mike, is about 1%. So we haven't seen anything yet. We may see something, but it's not going to be material. In Brazil, they're still working out exactly what the equipment sharing, network sharing means. It will mean probably something more elevated in terms of active sharing between TIM and Oi, which means we'll have to take all that into consideration as we price our product down there. In the case of Claro and Telefonica, or Vivo, it really isn't sharing of active electronics or any kind of equipment. It's really more of a tower-sharing type of agreement, which we don't think really is going to have any impact at all in terms of what we were expecting down there from those 2 carriers.
Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Jeff, just thinking about the -- you said AT&T obviously quite active in the quarter. Can you sort of identify whether or not that's VIP-related or is it too premature to be VIP?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: I don't think I know. I don't think they tell us when they're deploying, whether this was part of the regular rollout or part of the -- I will guess that most of the new leases, which we're seeing a nice number from AT&T and our backlog are probably VIP.
Operator: Then next from RBC Capital Markets, Jonathan Atkin.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: The 40% of your sites that have been touched by LTE, I wonder if you had a similar number in terms of the number of sites that have fiber deployed to them by at least 1 carrier? Would that be a similar percentage or would it deviate from that at all?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: That may be a bit higher. That maybe 50%, 55%, Jonathan. Although we don't -- because we don't really control our carriers' utilities, backhaul easement, we don't have perfect visibility, but we do try and track that. And I think that number is around 50%, 55%.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then I was interested in the triple net structure of the Mobilitie assets. And does it make sense at some point to try to revisit the terms of those contracts to make them more in conformity with the rest of your portfolio?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It does. It does. We're analyzing how we do that. Some of the issues involved with that -- the accounting for that is very complex. And at this point, we think it involves changing lease accounting, which has some crazy impacts that bear nothing in relation to the economic effect of what we'd be trying to accomplish there. So we're trying to sort all that through. But the big picture economic proposition there remains the same. It's something we'd be interested in purchasing and I would think something that T-Mobile might have an interest in selling. So stay tuned. We're still working on that.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then finally on the $6 million iDEN exposure, does that represent only second half of this year contracts that roll? Or is that -- and therefore, that number could increase in the out years if there's decommissioning?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, that number could increase in the out years. That's just a 2-quarter number, which is when the rights to terminate begin for Sprint as of July 1.
Operator: Then next from Morgan Stanley, we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Could you talk a little bit about some of the deals, the big deals, you've done over the last couple of quarters, Jeff, and just how the lease-up is tracking versus your expectations? And in terms of the portfolio growth this year, are you still -- we'll likely to see more of that in international markets primarily in Brazil or are you still focused on Central America as well?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, the 2 deals -- and including Brazil, 3 deals, are going very well. And those 3 deals are the primary recipients of new lease activity versus amendments because they both were underrepresented relative to the rest of our portfolio with AT&T and Verizon tenancies. So that's exactly what how we had hoped it would play out, and it is playing out. And a good portion of the new lease backlog that I mentioned is around those activities. And the portfolio growth, we certainly -- there's a lot going on and we're very committed and believe that we're well going to hit the 5% to 10% portfolio growth. But as, I think, I mentioned last time, Simon, I think as far as years pass, certainly compared to last year, I believe the mix of what we're going to do will probably be more international, maybe as much as 50% of what we'd grow this year might be internationally or perhaps even a little bit more.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. And so -- and looking at existing markets for international?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, there's a lot to do in the Western Hemisphere. We're still getting off the ground and running in Brazil. We have very high hopes and expectations for that market in particular.
Operator: Then next we'll move to the line of Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Jeff, quick question, you mentioned the new lease backlogs at an all-time high. Is this primarily cell splitting in markets where LTE has already been deployed at this point? And then maybe second question, just that the site development business obviously another strong quarter, how much visibility do you have from here in terms of how long you would expect this type of run rate?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: I do believe most of the new brand in leases, Jason, is cell splitting in markets that you have seen a basic LTE network deployed. Not 100%, but I think substantially all -- particularly the ones that were -- are from AT&T and Verizon. On the -- I'm sorry, your second question?
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I mean I'll ask -- maybe this could follow up on the first question. So you've said 40% of sites have LTE at this point. So if you're over indexing cell splitting in those markets, would you expect the backlog in cell splitting to accelerate as sort of that LTE amendment overlay percentage moves higher?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And how is that factored into -- is an acceleration factored into your guidance for the year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Probably not because of the 6-month lead time that you will typically be associated with the new lease. If -- and you know this, because it's always been this way. If you don't really have your new lease signed up by September 1, it's really not going to contribute to that particular year's fiscal results. So we basically have the second quarter of lease-up that will, at least on the new lease side, that will impact the rest of 2013. So I think you're probably looking more towards the impacts from all that in 2014 and beyond. On the services side, it was a good quarter, very busy. Our backlogs today are very solid, near or at all-time highs, which gives us the confidence around increasing our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year. But services, it's a short-cycle business. You can get an order in the second month of the quarter and have it completed by the third month and impact, which is -- what happened in the first quarter where we were -- we produced results that were substantially ahead of our outlook. So it is a -- on a project basis, it's a short cycle kind of business, but given the mandates to us for entire projects, particularly from Sprint and T-Mobile, we're very confident that it's going to be our busiest year ever this year and that activity will go well into 2014. So on an order basis, it's short cycle. But if you're mandated to have the entire project, as we are in those cases, it gives you a lot more visibility.
Operator: Then next, we'll move to Deutsche Bank and the line of Brett Feldman.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So if we look at Sprint and the decisions they need to make here, if their current set of transactions close as anticipated, they'll likely be deploying 2.5 spectrum that they'll have full control over it. It could also end up being that they do a transaction with DISH, in which case they could be deploying AWS-4 spectrum that they have full control over, or maybe even both bands. And so my question here is, could you remind us what's contemplated in the existing master lease agreement with Sprint so that whenever we do get an update from them on where they're taking the network, we can determine the extent to which that activity would be incremental?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, our agreement with Sprint allows them to deploy spectrum without an additional charge just for the sake of deploying spectrum where they own spectrum. So in fact, there was a combination there and they all -- and that DISH and Sprint became one, that would be how it worked. Now the real issue though is our agreement is also totally equipment-specific. So if new equipment, either antennas or receivers, transmitters or anything were required to submit those additional -- or to operate those additional frequencies, which has for the most part always been the case, that provides an amendment opportunity.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And so just to be clear, you said the agreement which is I guess essentially designed around Network Vision, if they go back to any site they've already contemplated and they can accommodate that spectrum in the existing gear, there's nothing unique for you. If they need new gear, that would be additive and then presumably any new cell sites, regardless of the spectrum, would be additive and as well. Is that correct?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: That's correct.
Operator: Then next we will move to Pacific Crest and the line of Michael Bowen.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Maybe a bigger picture question as you move through the year and you're looking at acquisitions, how is your approach different now than it might have been a couple of years ago? And then also, with regard to the tax rate, it's kind of gone up and down a little bit here. Can you give us any thoughts on how we might want to treat that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Acquisitions, we have remained, I think, in all cases, exactly the same as we were a couple of years ago with the exception that the reduced cost of debt has allowed us to reduce our estimates of our WAC. So we're able to basically pay more, yet get the same return spread that we've always been looking for over our cost of capital. That's really, really the only difference over the last several years.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, Michael, with regard to the tax rate, I assume you're talking about changes in the federal income tax rate. Obviously, it doesn't have much of an immediate impact on us, given our net loss position and the meaningful NOLs that we have to the extent that it fluctuates meaningfully in either direction. It may extend or shorten the time period until we eventually get to where we've used up our NOLs. But at this stage, we have such a long runway, roughly 8-plus years and the view towards potentially becoming a REIT, subsequent to that, that I'm not sure that it really has much of a meaningful impact.
Operator: Then next we'll move to the line of Colby Synesael of Cowen.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. Just wanted to go back to the 5% to 10% portfolio growth, just after being a little bit late on tower adds in the first quarter, and obviously, recognizing you have some M&A that you're working on. Is there any indication whether you feel at this point you'll be more towards the lower end or higher end of that range for the year? And then the other question just has to do with discretionary CapEx. You're effectively in line with your guidance this year. You didn't change your tower construction, still expecting 380 to 400, but you did increase your discretionary CapEx for the year by, I think, about $30 million. Just curious what that's in regards to?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: On the first question, it's too early to really say whether it will be at 5% or 10%. There's certainly plenty of stuff out there and plenty of time this year to achieve or even exceed the high end of the portfolio growth goal.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Colby, on the CapEx, we actually increased the full year guidance by $24 million. And it's really a mix of all the different things. We did sign up some M&A agreements. So roughly half, a little less than half of that is from new M&A deals under contract. We also outperformed a little bit our expectations in the first quarter on ground lease by us, so that carries through and is a factor contributing to the increase. And frankly, some of those costs that we talked about in the new builds earlier are also in there. So it's really across the board, but no one item is standing out.
Operator: Then next we'll move to New Street Research and the line of Jonathan Chaplin.
Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP: This is Spencer in for Jonathan. We've been hearing about the efficiency for deploying high-frequency spectrum on small cells. And with AT&T going to 40,000 and Clearwire deploying spectrum in the coming years, I was just curious as to your thoughts on the small cell business and if your perspective has changed at all?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, we're watching the small cell business carefully. We currently have a material minority -- material for ExteNet, minority investment in ExteNet, which is really how we're approaching the deployment of small cells and seeing how that works and whether that is in fact going to prove to be a multi-tenant business model similar to towers. Beyond that though, we are starting to see a number of inquiries where customers, carriers are looking to deploy small cells on our sites. Where they have immediate accessibility, these would be hung at the 20-foot level and provide the lower coverage closer to the ground that the small cells are designed to do. So I think it's going to be definitely an active part of wireless network deployment over the next couple of years and something that we're kind of looking to play in a variety of different ways.
Operator: Then next we'll move to the line of Kevin Smithen of Macquarie.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research: Maybe just a follow-up to that, can you give us an update on ExteNet, what its size is today and growth rate? And I guess, why wouldn't you bring this in-house before small cell growth accelerates and valuation picks up significantly?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, I mean, I can't you give any details about ExteNet because that's not our business to do. But I would say that we are very interested and potentially increasing our interest in ExteNet and you should stay tuned as to how that might play out.
Operator: Then the last person in the question queue at this time, Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just a follow-up on the DAS payments, to what extent that it makes sense or are there opportunities to pursue that in Brazil or elsewhere internationally?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It could make a lot of sense, Jonathan, and we are considering that. And that would be something that would be entirely consistent with our investment in and agreements with ExteNet.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So how does that work? Do you get the right of first refusal on any new DAS installations outside of this country? Or is that something that you can pursue?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, we're free to pursue any of that stuff outside of this country.
Operator: And back to you, sir.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Great. Well thanks, everyone, for joining us. Appreciate the interest and we look forward to getting together again when we report our second quarter results. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this call will be available for replay after 1 p.m. Eastern today through May 14 at midnight.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark DeRussy, Director of Finance. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss in this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2013 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we may make. Our statements are as of today, February 22, 2013, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted to our website, www.sbasite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brendan to comment on our fourth quarter results.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, our fourth quarter financial and operational results were excellent. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for leasing revenue, services revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Total revenues were $293.8 million, up 59.9% over the year-earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $260.8 million or a 57.9% increase over the fourth quarter of 2011. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including the impact of the Mobilitie and TowerCo acquisitions, which closed during the second and fourth quarters, respectively, of 2012. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue continues to come from the U.S. and its territories, with approximately 5.3% of total leasing revenue in the quarter coming from international operations. Site leasing segment operating profit was $198.6 million or an increase of 51.3% over the fourth quarter of 2011. Site leasing contributed 97.2% of our total segment operating profit. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $187 million or a 46.7% increase over the year-earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 77.7% compared to 80.5% in the year-earlier period. As expected, margins were slightly impacted by the addition of the less mature Mobilitie and TowerCo portfolios. With respect to the domestic Mobilitie towers, we calculate tower cash flow margins by recording expenses as ours and grossing up revenue by the same amount in order to reflect the triple-net reimbursement of these expenses by our tenants. This produced a reported tower cash flow margin of approximately 65% on these towers in the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the economic reality of 100% tower cash flow margins. We continue to experience strong leasing demand both domestically and internationally. Amendments continue to be numerous and contributed approximately 88% of U.S. leasing revenue added in the quarter. Most of these amendments were LTE-related. The big 4 U.S. carriers contributed approximately 86% of our consolidated incremental leasing activity in the quarter. We have a solid leasing backlog and expect that the first quarter will be another strong one in terms of customer activity. Our services revenues were $33.1 million compared to $18.7 million in the year-earlier period, reflecting generally higher activity levels and work mandated to us by our Sprint Network Vision contract. Services segment operating profit was $5.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Services segment operating profit margin was 17.6% compared to 12.4% in the year-earlier period. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $19.6 million, including noncash compensation charges of $3.3 million. SG&A expenses were $15.8 million in the year-earlier period, including noncash compensation charges of $2.7 million. Our overhead efficiency continues to improve as we grow. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 6.7%, a decline of 190 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA was $177 million or a 50.9% increase over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 64.7% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 66.2% in the year-earlier period. Strong organic margin expansion from our leasing segment was slightly offset by the inclusion of the less mature Mobilitie and TowerCo towers and an increase in our lower margin services revenue. AFFO increased 60.5% to $113 million compared to $70.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. AFFO per share increased 37.5% to $0.88 compared to $0.64 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net loss attributable to SBA Communications Corporation during the fourth quarter was $52.5 million compared to a net loss of $29.1 million in the year-earlier period. Contributing to the net loss in the fourth quarter were $18.6 million in acquisition-related expenses primarily associated with the TowerCo transaction. Net loss per share for the fourth quarter was $0.41 compared to $0.27 per share in the year-earlier period. Quarter-end shares outstanding were 126.9 million. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 4,134 tower sites, including 3,256 towers acquired from TowerCo and 800 tower sites in Brazil. The company paid $1.43 billion in cash and issued 4.6 million shares for these towers, including $175.9 million related to the Brazilian towers paid in January of 2013. SBA also built 103 towers during the fourth quarter. We ended 2012 with 17,491 owned towers, an increase of 66% versus 2011 and an increase of 32% in the fourth quarter alone. 14,929 of these towers are in the U.S. and its territories and 2,562 are in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $1,315,000,000, consisting of $3.9 million of nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures, such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx, and $1.31 billion of discretionary cash capital expenditures. These amounts exclude the cash payment for the Brazilian acquisition, which was paid in the first quarter of 2013. Discretionary cash CapEx for the fourth quarter includes $1.25 billion incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, exclusive of any working capital adjustments and paid earn-outs. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $26.2 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress, and $8.6 million for gross augmentations and tower upgrades. Of the $8.6 million augmentation figure, approximately $5.6 million or 65% was simultaneously reimbursed by our customers, resulting in net augmentation cash expenditures to us of $3 million. Reimbursements are amortized in the site leasing revenue over the lease or amendment term, which gave rise to the augmentation. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $24.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms, our most active quarter of the year. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers. At the end of 2012, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 31 years. At this point, I'll turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the quarter with $5.4 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash, short-term investments of $266.3 million, resulting in net debt of $5.2 billion. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3x, which is squarely within our target leverage range of 7x to 7.5x. Pro forma for the Brazilian acquisition, our leverage at year end would have been 7.5x. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3x. Our revolver balance at the end of the year was $100 million, which we borrowed for the Brazilian acquisition. Our available committed capacity was $630 million, pro forma for an increase in commitments from $700 million to $730 million that occurred early in 2013. During the quarter, we repurchased 66.2 million in principal of our 1.875% convertible notes and privately negotiated transactions for $107.5 million in cash. The notes will mature on May 1 of this year, and we have formally elected to settle both the principal and associated premium in cash. Our total remaining settlement obligation is approximately $615 million net of hedges, prior conversions and assuming a hypothetical stock price of $70 a share. We expect to fund this maturity with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from future secured debt financings, which we believe will give us an opportunity to borrow at lower rates and to extend the tenor of our debt maturities. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our debt had a weighted average annual cash coupon of 4.3% and a weighted average remaining maturity of 4.6 years. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter and currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. We continue to view stock repurchases as an opportunistic rather than systematic allocation of capital. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter was a great end to a great year for SBA. Not only were our financial results excellent, we ended the year with a collection of assets and markets that we believe will help drive growth for us for years to come. I'm extremely pleased with our positioning. As you can see from our increased outlook, we expect to produce material growth this year in all key metrics, including AFFO per share. Domestically, our leasing and services business is being driven by the big 4 U.S. carriers, all of whom were very busy in the fourth quarter. Activity is mostly still amendments, but we are seeing an increasing number of new leases. The lease-up we executed in the fourth quarter well exceeded our expectations and is responsible for about $4 million of the increase in the midpoint of our full year 2013 tower cash flow outlook. Current activity levels with the big 4 U.S. carriers remain high. If these levels stay this high all year, we will have experienced a greater level of incremental domestic leasing activity from the big 4 U.S. carriers than we currently assume in our 2013 outlook. We are also starting to see more activity from Clearwire, which, if it continues, could be another basis for outperformance. We have yet to see any activity from DISH or Public Safety. Our outlook includes a second half of the year loss of $6 million in item revenue, reflecting the worst-case scenario pursuant to our agreements with Sprint. Any result better than the worst-case scenario will reduce that number, and we have received no termination notice as yet. Our full year 2013 site leasing revenue guidance includes $62 million of noncash straight-line revenue, while our tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA outlooks are cash only. Excluding the noncash straight-line revenue at the midpoints, our full year outlook implies an approximately 77% tower cash flow margin and a 66% adjusted EBITDA margin. All this domestic leasing activity has benefited our services business. Activity in general is up, plus we have certain work mandated to us through our Sprint Network Vision and T-Mobile 4G agreements. As a result, we are expecting our busiest services year in quite some time. Services backlog at December 31, 2012 was $46 million compared to $15 million a year earlier. Internationally, we continue to see good levels of activity in all our markets. We see 3G and 4G activity in Canada and 3G activity in Central America with 4G still to come. We've built towers in all international markets in the fourth quarter and ended the year with solid backlogs for both leasing and newbuilds in all markets. Our biggest international news in the fourth quarter was, of course, our entry into Brazil through the acquisition of 800 towers from Telefonica. We had been analyzing the Brazilian market for a long time, making inroads, establishing contacts and looking for the right opportunity. We found it in December in an expedited process run by Telefonica. Our familiarity with Telefonica through our Central American operations and prior Telefonica tower sales processes, as well as our ability to close by year end, greatly contributed to our success in this process. This was the opportunity we were waiting for, giving us 800 high-quality, ground-based towers located throughout Brazil with existing collocation revenue and relationships with all of the major Brazilian wireless carriers. It was the perfect size and configured platform for us to enter Brazil. We are very attracted to Brazil for a number of reasons: growing population, low 3G penetration, no real 4G penetration yet, future plans, spectrum auctions, reasonably good zoning and land use protections, 4 major carriers all relatively similarly positioned and a strong regulator intent on competition and quality of service. We believe Brazil currently has only about 20% of the number of cell sites that we have here in the United States but almost 2/3 of the population. We believe these factors have caused and will cause a huge demand for additional wireless infrastructure, and we're very excited about what we might accomplish in Brazil in the next decade. We expect to grow in Brazil by building towers and also by acquiring additional towers. Right now, we are in the process of building a team in Brazil and integrating the Telefonica assets, which we expect to have substantially completed by the end of the second quarter. We're very excited about Brazil and expect it to occupy much of our international focus for the remainder of the year. With respect to additional portfolio growth, in 2013, we probably will not replicate last year's success. We do, however, have confidence in achieving our annual goal of 5% to 10% portfolio growth, particularly now that we have established a presence in Brazil. We intend to continue to actively pursue newbuild and acquisition opportunities that we believe will meet or exceed our return requirements. Based upon our outlook and assuming a typical multiple paid for acquisitions, we would have almost $1 billion of discretionary spending ability while still maintaining our target leverage levels. Between our expected AFFO generation and our revolver availability, we have the cash resources to be able to fund that level of investment. If we were successful with that level of investment, depending on the timing, there would be upside to our 2013 outlook, as today, it only includes approximately $375 million of discretionary spending in 2013, of which $176 million was already spent in Brazil. Our balance sheet is in great shape, which I'm particularly proud of, given the amount of acquisition activity last year. As Mark mentioned, we intend to satisfy all of our obligations, our 1 7/8% convertible notes in cash, and we are working on secured financings now to accomplish that. Markets are very good. We expect to be very successful and to accomplish at least this good a financing result, as set forth in our outlook. After the refinancing of our 1 7/8% convertible notes, we have no debt maturities until October 2014. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize and thank all of our employees for a record-breaking 2012. The amount of time and attention that resulted in our successes last year was extraordinary and a true team effort across our entire company. It is because of all the hard work and contributions of our employees last year that we are able to stand here today and expect a very successful 2013. Christina, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll first go to the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I was interested in the color that you provided domestically on leasing trends and wondered for international, does your guidance kind of imply higher lease-up rates or similar lease-up rates compared to the U.S.? And then with regard to a possible portfolio expansion overseas with regard to, specifically, carrier transactions either in Central America or in South America, what do you see as the prospects there?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, internationally, the lease-up that we've assumed and have been experiencing, Jonathan, is similar, although it's coming from different places. Internationally, it's more new leases. In the U.S., it's more amendments. But in terms of the revenue contribution per tower, it's similar. I believe there's going to be a lot of international acquisition opportunities for the next several years. You're starting to see international carriers become more comfortable with and embracing the outsourcing of their infrastructure and selling assets. Obviously, that's how we got into Brazil. That's how we got a lot of the towers in Central America. Some of our peers have had similar experiences with carrier divestitures. So I think it has the potential to be very active, and we'll be watching and looking closely and picking our spots.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then with regards to FX, I might have missed this, but should we just sort of assume current rates in your guidance then for your foreign currency exposures?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It's actually in the press release, Jonathan that we've assumed a BRL 2.0 to USD 1 as of now. I realize the real strengthened slightly from that level, but for now, that's what we're assuming.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then with regard to staffing throughout the year for international, where do things stand compared to where you need to be?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: We're building a team. We have more work to do. We have assumed an incremental SG&A burden of about $2 million to $3 million for Brazil. We're not spending that kind of money today because we're not fully staffed up, but that would be the kind of the run rate that we would expect from that. And if we were to step up to that level of back office, we would have substantial additional operational capabilities down there.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I want to talk a little bit about the debt market, been a lot of questions about it recently, obviously. How do you think about the debt market? And maybe talk about the rates you're seeing versus the yields, how it impacts valuation and deal prices and your ability to pursue deals.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, there has been some headlines on the movement of the treasury. The way that the financing, that we source works is really a combination of 2 things. It's the base rate and then it's the spread. And spreads continue to be wide by historical standards. And the investment community is really looking for an all-in yield so that there is room, as base rates rise, for spreads to contract, and everybody still get where they want to be. So we feel particularly good about what we're going to be doing this year. And I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but by the next time we speak with our first quarter results, we'll have done what we're going to do, at least that's the plan. So while it's -- we're watching it, and obviously, it impacts companies like ourselves, which are fundamentally real estate-based companies that as you move farther and farther down the acceptance of AFFO per share, it's going to be impacted by interest rates. So we understand that, and our job is to be thoughtful and opportunistic around capital structure to continue to source debt that makes sense for us at the lowest rates possible with the best certainty and laddering maturities and all that stuff. What has happened in the last month or 2 has not impacted our thoughts at all around continued growth ability.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Great. The second question is -- you mentioned, I think, in your remarks that you're starting to see Clearwire show up. We also, in digging through the Sprint, Starburst, SoftBank proxy notice that, kind of with or without Clearwire, Sprint is expecting to put in a lot of 2.5 gigahertz cell sites. As you think about your MLAs, and not to talk specifically to T-Mobile or Sprint, but as you think about 2.5 gigahertz frequency being deployed and DISH making a lot of noise that they'd really like to get their 2.0 gigahertz spectrum deployed, how does that fit into your MLAs? The RAD centers that are out there, what height this new equipment might be placed at. Just kind of what's the opportunity if we think generically about 2.0 frequency and 2.5 frequency being deployed.
Mark DeRussy: Well, for us not to benefit from that, all the things that you talked about would have to fit within the existing RAD centers and the existing prescribed equipment specifications that we have agreed to. Based on everything I know, and there's a lot that I don't know about exactly how those items will be deployed, so I think it's still yet to come, I think it's very unlikely that those types of deployments will be able to be fit within the existing entitlements. But obviously, that means an opportunity for us for additional rent.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: And also, Clearwire mentioned the other day on their call, they think some of the stuff might have to start happening at lower heights because of the densification of these networks.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, and that brings up a whole new -- that's a brand-new deal.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Richard for Phil. I wanted to get a sense of how much of the sequential $10 million increase in leasing revenue quarter-to-quarter is organic versus acquired.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: A little less than half of it, Richard, is organic.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: You're talking Q3 to Q4?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Q4 to Q1, I think.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Q4 and 1, yes.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, Q4 to Q1, approximately 40% of it is organic.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then for the year, I guess in terms of the incremental leasing revenue, what are you looking for, for splits from amendment versus new leases? Are we still kind of heavy towards the amendments?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. Although we are seeing increasing numbers, the absolute numbers of new leases is going up.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then finally, on the services revenue side, it looks like we saw some great sequential growth throughout last year. Is that kind of topping off now? And should we expect it to fade away? Are you seeing something specific? Or is it just being conservative that you might not maintain this high level?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, I would have to say it's us being conservative.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Mark Albanese: This is Mark Albanese on for Jonathan. A question on the longer-term growth. How do you think about leasing in the 2014 and 2015 time frame? And what have you done and will continue to do to extend the high-growth portion of the demand curve?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Well, we, for the most part, are recipients of carrier demand needs. So we're benefiting from all that as opposed to doing anything proactive that would alter the customer demand curve. I will tell you that there are a lot of resources constraints in the market today, which cause me to doubt that all the work that cumulatively has been said by our customers will get done in 2013 will, in fact, get done. Running a part of our business on the services side and seeing the resources issues there, I'm fairly confident that a lot of this stuff will spill over into 2014. So you have some basic work that people might be thinking about getting done in 2013, which will not, that will spill over. And then we're also starting to see positive signs, the cell splitting, which, I believe, as we talked about before, will be the next leg of the curve once we get the basic 4G networks in place. But we still have quite a bit of ways to go before the 4G networks will be basically in place.
Mark Albanese: Great. And just a follow-up, there's been a lot of news flow on small cells recently. Can you give us some thoughts on that opportunity and if this is something you potentially would pursue on your own, perhaps, through your investment in ExteNet or another acquisition?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Well, we'll clearly be watching it closely through ExteNet. We will be looking for opportunities, obviously, to add small cells to our existing assets should those opportunities arise, and we think there will be some opportunities for small cells to come in at lower heights and actually be utilized on some of our towers in the more urban areas. In terms of actually going in a brand-new small cell installation, I think we're going to really wait and see how things play out. The bedrock of our business model and I think our success as we've acquired assets that have multi-tenant capabilities, and we just have to kind of wait and see if that is, in fact, the small cell world as it ultimately gets rolled out.
Operator: We'll move on to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I think there's been a lot of recognition that there's a lot of opportunities that's pent up for the tower companies, and we've been very optimistic about the secular trends that are going to unfold over the course of the year as the wireless players are kind of racing to build the best and the biggest networks they can. There's obviously been some renewed fears that have kind of baked into the stocks over the last month, I think, specifically around alternative cases for consolidation. And I think we all know what those kind of cases are. People are wondering if Sprint comes in and buys PCS, how the industry might look different than people thought it might look a month ago. Could we go back and revisit a little bit about your MLAs and how they're structured with respect to PCS and Sprint and T-Mobile and kind of how -- I think you've protected yourself with respect to those relationships if consolidation does happen differently than people expect. That will be helpful, I think, to go over that again.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, correct me if I'm wrong, Brendan, but the Sprint MLA gives us about 9 years. The T-Mobile gives us about 7. We do not have an MLA with Metro, so it kind of falls as other non-MLA type customers do. So there's probably about 3 years on average left of term there. Metro, as of year-end, was about 3% of our site leasing revenue, and that number is moving down because everything else is moving up over the course of the year. So we're not too worried about it, David.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: And from an overlap standpoint between a T-Mobile and a Metro, Metro only represents about 1% of the revenue on the sites where they both exist today. So it's fairly de minimis.
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And I know that this is -- it's not, I think, is relevant now as it's been in the past even, but people are wondering about how rates, as they move up through time, impact a company like an SBA. I think there's a recognition that there's long-term revenue contracts, there's long-term cost contracts. Is there anything more to know about how rising interest rates impact a tower company from your perspective, Mark or Brendan?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, and I think this kind of goes along with what Jeff was saying earlier. Obviously, there's risks as rates go up as we carry the amount of leverage that we do, but it would affect our cost of financing, which ultimately feeds into AFFO and AFFO per share. So from that standpoint, there's some risk, which we try to address now through longer tenors and mixing markets that we're in. But as it relates to the operational side, we've got fixed rates in our leases to the extent that inflationary rates were higher than our fixed contractual escalators. We wouldn't necessarily share in that, but on the same side, most of our expenses are tied up in our ground leases, which also have fixed escalators, so our costs are controlled. So we don't see it as a huge risk.
Mark DeRussy: If you look at our buckets of expense, David, the cost of site leasing revenue is the largest, and there's not really much inflationary pressure there. Another good chunk, although this would be third after interest expense, would be our SG&A. And that -- we would have some ability -- that's more of a variable cost that we could work on if we needed to. And then there's our interest rate -- expense, which we will continue to be thoughtful around and opportunistic around. And as I've said all along, one of the factors that causes us to be comfortable in the 7x to 7.5x terms of leverage is the current interest rate in the immediately foreseeable interest rate environment. I mean, if things were to change dramatically there, we would have the ability to take leverage down.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: And most of our debt is fixed-rate also. I think it's important to point out that as we sit here today, approximately 86% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate and offloading.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wonder if you could spend a little bit of time on the international business. Are you going to give us a little bit more color on sort of percent of revenues, just give us a percent of growth or just a little bit more color as this becomes a more material part of your business? And specifically, on the Telefonica towers, what has Telefonica done in terms of leasing those towers up? Is there much there already, or do you see a lot of leasing up opportunity? And I think you talked about building up a staffing effort. When do you think you can really start to build new sites in earnest in Brazil? Is that more of a second half event or are you at that straightaway?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: That's a good question, Simon. And I'll tackle the last one first. If you noticed, we have not increased our international or our overall newbuild targets from the last time we put out guidance. And that really leaves us room to take the rest of this year, although that's not our goal in Brazil to get newbuilds cranked up. So we were hopeful -- we are not positioned today to go out and make a full-scale assault on it, but I do believe in a quarter or so, we will be so that we do have some opportunity for some upside there on the newbuilds in Brazil, which frankly, our outlook today does not include any of those in 2013, although long term, that's the primary reason we are attracted to Brazil. The towers that we bought, actually, one of the reasons we really liked them is that they have proven to be good locations to others. They have about 1.33 or...
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, that's right.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Correct? 1.33 tenants per tower included, and all the rest of the co-locators are the other 4 big -- or the other 3 big carriers in Brazil, Claro, TIM and Oi. And we've already started to receive some very good inquiry for additional collocation on those sites. So we're extremely pleased with the assets that we have and kind of tickled that, that's our first -- that's how we've entered the country, with those assets. In terms of percentage of revenue, I think we're slightly below 6% for the year. It will grow faster just because it's not in absolute dollars, of course, given the size of the U.S. business, but on a percentage basis. But as we've said for many years, we're going to try and get to 10% and see how things look at that time. I don't think that's going to be in 2013, and it may not be in 2014, depending on the balance of how things go. But in general, we like what we've done so far. We think international is an extremely good value creator for our shareholders if executed well, and we expect to continue to look for opportunities to expand that portion of our business.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: The first one is just to clarify the increase in the guidance for the year. I think you mentioned that $4 million of the increase in your tower cash flow guidance was related to the strong demand trends you saw in the fourth quarter flowing over into this year. I think you took the range up by about $17 million, so I was hoping you could break down the rest, in particular, with the contribution from the Brazilian towers.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yes, that's going to be about $10 million and the rest of it is going to be from other M&A that closed earlier than expected from the last time we -- or it was either added or closed earlier than we expected from the last time we gave guidance. I want to make clear on that point, though, that we're actually extremely busy on the organic side. But rather than carry that level of activity through, in our conservatism, we're only going to increase as we actually beat [ph] On a quarter-by-quarter basis.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And I'll just stick with the M&A thing for a second here. Thinking about the deals you closed last year, 2 large portfolios that had high exposure to Sprint and T-Mobile but very low exposure to AT&T and Verizon. Since you announced those deals, AT&T disclosed that they're going to be adding 10,000 additional cell sites over the next couple of years. How do you feel about the positioning of those newly acquired portfolios to get that business, and are you actually starting to see it flow in yet?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, not only do we feel great about it, we are actually starting to see lease-up on those assets from both AT&T and Verizon.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And because you don't have master lease agreements, all of this is incremental, correct?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Absolutely.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Mike McCormack with Nomura.
Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: I know you mentioned the fact that you're going to be focused primarily on Brazil, but could you just give us your thought post maybe this year, what other countries that might fit your criteria and what those criteria might be?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we're looking for countries similar to the ones we've entered, where there is a good political and regulatory stability, reasonably good and predictable land use regulations, a multiplicity of strong carriers, where there's not any one single dominant player in the market, and opportunities to kind of get in early in terms of 3G and 4G deployments and it'd be even better if there are some announced prospects for future spectrum auctions. So you kind of mix all that together, Mike, and that's what we look for.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment.
Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: As we think about the possibility for other carriers in the U.S. to maybe do a sale-leaseback of their tower portfolios, how do you look at that in terms of the growth and the health of the tower collocation model these days? Is it a situation where the denominator of revenue that public tower companies could hold is bigger, the demand might be the same, so there's just a slower level of growth? Or do you think that the addition of supply from the acquisitions that you've done domestically over the last few years, do you actually see that driving incremental demand from carriers? Because there might be site collocations that they either didn't have access to beforehand or were less aware of the availability. Just some insights in terms of the evolution of this market would be great.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, I mean, the carrier towers that exist today, should they -- they're kind of on the market today in terms of collocation availability. But there are varying degrees of activity levels and focus on that by the carriers that continue to own towers. They're not competitive to the independently-owned towers because all through the history of our industry, if there were a tower that satisfied a carrier's need, that's where they would have gone rather than building a tower. So that's not -- should those towers come to trade hands, Mike, that's not going to really change the dynamic. You will obviously have bigger denominators if those move to private hands. And there is probably a decent, although I wouldn't say hugely material, opportunity for different focus to bring about increased activity levels. I don't think there's any carriers today who own their own towers that are actively prohibiting others from collocating on those towers. They may not be as focused on it or it's certainly not their top priority, but they're not prohibiting it.
Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And how should investors just be thinking about cash organic revenue growth in the business over the next few years as you balance amendment activity, new spectrum in the market, typical densification relative to maybe some of the churn risks from transactions that have already been announced and you're aware of that could cause just some of those leases, when they expire, to get decommissioned? Is there an average organic run rate that you guys keep in mind as a rule of thumb on, like, a 1- or 3-year view?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Every year, we try and be as precise as we can, but I would say over the next 3 years, we're looking and putting everything together that we know about, the puts and the takes, that we're looking for, high-single-digit tower cash flow growth, which, as you then ripple down the income statement, should produce increasing levels of EBITDA growth and then AFFO growth. And that would just be on an organic basis, and we hope to do better than that through portfolio growth.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research: Very little was ever spoken about the subtle nuances between the 3 public tower companies in terms of revenue recognition or contract terms with the carriers. Can you talk a little bit about your contracts with Sprint and AT&T, any provisions that might cause you to see more reported upside, if you will, from those 2 carriers in 2013 and '14 and maybe some of your other competitors are seeing?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, let's start, Kevin, with AT&T. We don't have a master agreement with them, so every piece of business that we do with AT&T is recognized when we do it and contributes to increases in tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. In terms of Sprint, we have a master agreement with Sprint, which, over a multiyear period, obligates Sprint to basically upgrade a specified number of CDMA sites. And the way that works is we begin to accrue cash revenue recognition at the later of either an end date, which hasn't come yet, or the date that Sprint actually completes the upgrade on the tower. And we only had about -- well, we had actually less than 10% of the towers that are subject to that agreement that had actually begun to accrue that cash revenue in the fourth quarter. So we have a lot of -- even though the straight-line has already been taken, what's yet to come and why we believe we will have very, very good tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA growth is -- that only hits those metrics when, in fact, the work is done and Sprint has actually commenced their activity on the upgraded site. I'm not exactly sure how anyone else's agreements work, but that's how ours work.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research: Great. And also, we've heard that your visibility into Verizon's AWS build-out is starting to improve. Will it have any revenue impact in 2013, and is this incorporated in your guidance at all?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It could, and it's not.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: A couple of things. Can you talk about, just in general terms, what your expectations are for margins in Brazil for the towers? And then secondly, we've been out there talking about LTE builds and amendments for 4G in the U.S. being strongest this year and then maybe tailing off a little bit next year. Can you just give us your opinion from an industry standpoint in the U.S. what your thoughts are and whether you think we're on the mark or whether you think the activity will continue to be really robust in 2014?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: I'll take the last one first. I think that concern is a bit off the mark for a couple reasons. Primarily, the resources constraint that I talked about earlier is going to cause a lot of what people might have liked to have accomplished in 2013 to spill over in 2014. And if you look at AT&T's VIP project, I believe it's called, there are 10,000-plus additional macro sites and a bunch of small cells. Verizon's AWS plans, where Sprint and T-Mobile are likely to be, we see a very robust 2014 as well.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: And then Michael, as it relates to Brazil and our expectations around margins, one thing that is different about Brazil from the U.S. is that the carriers typically pick up the cost of the ground leases. However, as we do with our Mobilitie numbers, where we are passing through expenses to the carriers, we will record that ground lease expense on the books and we will gross up the revenue accordingly. So if you ignore that from a practical economic standpoint, the margins will be very high. They'll be close to 90%, 95%, even right out of the gate. When you take that into account, we only have a portfolio, obviously, that we have today, we'd be in the 60%, 65% range initially because the towers are still relatively immature at 1.3 tenants per tower. But as we add every incremental lease or amendment that we add there, we'll start to see those move up rather quickly. And we would expect to see the same thing as we do newbuilds and we start off with one tenant right from the get-go. But they'll move quickly up as you add that second tenant.
Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And one last thing, if I could. There's been a lot of talk, obviously, about rates, and if rates go up, if that was to put your business in a slower acquisition environment, can you talk about your expectations and opportunities in an environment where you're not acquiring as many towers per year? Because in the past, all the tower companies have done very, very well in that environment, but there's been a lot of concern around that.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, I mean, if we're not acquiring as much, our focus would be on maximizing organic growth. We'd probably have some SG&A opportunities, and we would look more towards stock repurchases, all of which we -- all of those leverage we are very comfortable would continue to really propel AFFO per share growth.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just 2 questions, if I may. The first one, I was curious, did your relationship with ExteNet preclude you from becoming more aggressive in small cell on your own, or would you have to kind of allow them to do that? And then the second question, just kind of going back to the comparison of amendment activity versus cell splitting, obviously, as we move forward, there'll be more and more cell splitting. Can you just remind us in previous upgrades, is cell splitting worth 1/3 of what you've seen from amendment activity? Is it worth 50%? Is it the same? Just trying to get some context in terms of how big the cell splitting opportunity could be, perhaps, over a 3-year period relative to what you've seen in the last 3 years relative to amendment activity.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, we do have -- in our relationship with ExteNet, we can't do DAS without offering it to them and they can't do towers without offering it to us. Small cell is a bit vague since nobody really contemplated that when we did our deal. But it would be our -- I mean, to the extent that there were active developments of that, that would probably be something that we would steer towards ExteNet's way regardless of what the legalities of our relationship were. But that, of course, wouldn't preclude us from leasing up small cells on any of our existing assets, including our 5,000 managed sites and our 17,000 -- well, 15,000 U.S. towers. So that, of course, we're free to do as the opportunity arises. Your other question is really impossible to answer. Some of our best, I think, analogous situations was when Verizon launched their 3G through the EVDO Rev A. That was primarily a software upgrade that the technology -- we didn't even really see that unlike what we're seeing now with 4G. But then as that got rolled out, you saw an increasing level of cell splitting as the demand for the product took off, and we think that's exactly what's going to occur in this case. But to kind of compare it to the magnitude of the existing 4G, you really can't. I mean, the answer is it's going to all depend on where the data and video demand curve is 3, 4 years out.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go back to the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: The rooftop business, are those kind of mature assets from the leasing standpoint? Are you seeing equal amounts of growth there in your domestic towers?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, it's a very small part of our overall leasing revenue, Jonathan, but we are seeing good activity on the rooftops as well, particularly with the LTE upgrades. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to reporting our first quarter results sometime in May.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to SBA Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Mark DeRussy, Director of Finance. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; as well as Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Please know that some of the information we will discuss in this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2012, 2013 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we may make. Our statements are as of today, November 6, 2012, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined by Regulation G. The reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G has been posted to our website, sbasite.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brendan to comment on our third quarter results.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, our third quarter financial and operational results were excellent. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for leasing revenue, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, and services revenue. Total revenues were $238.6 million, up 35.9% over the year-earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $208.8 million or a 35.2% increase over the third quarter of 2011. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including the impact of the Mobilitie acquisition, which closed during the second quarter of this year. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue comes from the U.S. and its territories, with approximately 6% of total leasing revenue coming from international operations. Site leasing segment operating profit was $162.2 million or an increase of 34.5% over the third quarter of 2011. Site leasing contributed 97.2% of our total segment operating profit. Tower cash flow for the third quarter of 2012 was $155.9 million or a 28.2% increase over the year-earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 79.3% compared to 79.8% in the year-earlier period. Margins were slightly impacted by the addition of the less mature Mobilitie portfolio. Our fourth quarter 2012 guidance assumes a sequential decline in Tower cash flow margin to reflect the less mature TowerCo sites, which were added on October 1. We expect margins to resume sequential growth in the first quarter of 2013. We continue to experience strong leasing demand, both domestically and internationally. Amendments, which were predominantly from AT&T, Verizon and Sprint, continue to be numerous and contributed approximately 85% of U.S. leasing revenue added in the quarter. The Big 4 U.S. carriers contributed approximately 81% of our consolidated incremental leasing activity in the quarter. We have a solid leasing backlog and expect that the fourth quarter will be another strong one in terms of customer activity. We are off to a good start in the quarter and expect a strong finish to the year. Our Services revenues were $29.8 million compared to $21 million in the year-earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $4.7 million in the third quarter compared to $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2011. Services segment operating profit margin was 15.8% compared to 14.8% in the year-earlier period. SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $17.6 million, including noncash compensation charges of $3.6 million. SG&A expenses were $15.4 million in the year-earlier period, including noncash compensation charges of $2.7 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A declined 142 basis points to 7.4% compared to the third quarter of 2011. We expect this positive momentum to continue into the fourth quarter and 2013, reflecting the efficiency, by which we believe we can materially add assets. Adjusted EBITDA was $146.6 million or a 30.3% increase over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 64.7% in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 64.9% in the year-earlier period. Strong, organic margin expansion from our leasing segment was offset by the inclusion of the less mature Mobilitie towers and an increase in our lower-margin Services revenues. AFFO increased 42.8% to $93.1 million compared to $65.2 million in the third quarter of 2011. AFFO per share increased an industry-leading 28.8% to $0.76 compared to $0.59 in the third quarter of 2011. Net loss attributable to SBA Communications Corporation during the third quarter was $52.4 million compared to a net loss of $33.3 million in the year-earlier period. Contributing to net loss in the third quarter were $5.7 million in acquisition-related expenses, primarily associated with the Mobilitie and TowerCo transactions and a $22.6 million charge related to the early retirements of our remaining 8% senior notes and the Mobilitie bridge loan. Net loss per share for the third quarter was $0.43 compared to $0.30 per share in the year-earlier period. Quarter-end shares outstanding were 121.8 million. In the third quarter, we acquired 37 towers and built 99 towers. We ended the quarter with 13,257 owned towers, an increase of 36% versus the year-earlier period. 11,541 of the towers were in the U.S. and its territories and 1,716 in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2012 were $57.8 million, consisting of $3.1 million of nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures, such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx, and $54.7 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the third quarter includes $20.8 million incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, exclusive of any working capital adjustments and paid earnouts. Discretionary cash CapEx also included $17.1 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress, and $6 million for gross augmentations and tower upgrades. Of the $6 million augmentation figure, approximately $5 million or 83% was reimbursed by our customers. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $10.4 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years, the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers. At the end of the quarter, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 30 years pro forma for TowerCo. In September and October, we completed our previously announced sale of certain gas assets to ExteNet for $125 million. We received $94.3 million in cash during the third quarter and $5.7 million in cash during the fourth quarter, which collectively represent a total of $100 million in agreed-upon cash consideration for the transaction. We also received a note for $25 million. Results of these operations are reflected as income from discontinued operations in the statement of operations. The results of these operations have been excluded from our calculations of Tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the third quarter with $5.4 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion, resulting in net debt of $3.9 billion. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.7X. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 2.9X. We were extraordinarily active in the capital markets during the third quarter. In July, we issued 800 million of senior notes due 2020. The notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 5.75%. The proceeds from this offering were used in part due to prepaid in full the Mobilitie bridge loan and repay all amounts outstanding under our revolver. In August, we issued 610 million of secured Tower revenue securities. The securities were issued at par and bear interest at 2.93%. They have an anticipated repayment date of December 2017 and a final maturity date of 2042. The proceeds from this offering were used to call the remaining $244 million in principal outstanding of our 8% senior notes, pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with the TowerCo acquisition and for general corporate purposes. In September, we issued 500 million of senior notes due 2019. These notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 5.625%. The proceeds from this offering were used to pay a portion of cash consideration in connection with the TowerCo acquisition. Also in September, we borrowed an incremental $300 million under our existing credit agreement in the form of a 7-year term loan B. The loan was issued at a 25 basis point discounted par and will accrue interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a 1% LIBOR floor. Finally, on October 1, we issued 4.6 million shares of Class A common stock, representing the equity component of the TowerCo transaction. These shares were subsequently sold by the selling shareholders in an underwritten offering. As of the end of the third quarter, our debt had a weighted average annual cash coupon of 4.3% and a weighted average remaining maturity of just under 5 years. 82% of our total debt is fixed rate. In the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock. We currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. Stock repurchases continue to be an important component within our overall capital allocation process. However, we continue to view them as opportunistic rather than systematic. We're very pleased with the balance sheet as we approach the end of 2012. We have long-term financing in place for both the Mobilitie and TowerCo transactions, as well as $700 million in committed capacity under our revolver. This year, we have raised $2.4 billion in debt at a weighted average maturity of 6.7 years. We believe the capital market decisions we have made in 2012 have put us in a good position as we look into 2013 and beyond, particularly with respect to refinancing our convertible notes due in 2013. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Happy Election Day. As you have heard, we did have a great quarter, meeting or exceeding the high end of our guidance across key financial metrics. Once again, we led our industry and a number of important growth metrics, including growth and AFFO per share. Our organic leasing activity was particularly strong, with the highest revenue added per tower in many years. We expect strong levels of activity to continue through the remainder of 2012 and all through 2013. We are experiencing strong demand across our entire portfolio, both domestic and international. In the U.S., we are in the middle stages of 4G deployments for some customers and early stages for others. We are seeing the benefits in both our leasing and services segments. We expect to benefit from this technological upgrade for the next several years, as carriers build out their initial coverage footprints to be followed by capacity spending, as consumer adoption increases. We are seeing cell splitting in certain 4G markets, although domestic leasing activity continues to center around customer overlays and upgrades to existing antenna sites. Internationally, we are seeing strong growth in new cell sites, with a lot of basic 3G coverage builds still ongoing in Central America. And we look forward to the introduction of 4G into those international markets in the future. As a result of anticipated continued strong demand from our U.S. and international customers, we are guiding the strong organic leasing growth in 2013. In the third quarter, we had our most active quarter with respect to executed lease amendments in the company's history. AT&T and Verizon continue to be very busy and represented well over half of our new business in the quarter. We saw a substantial increase from Sprint due to its Network Vision Project, and we have just began to work with T-Mobile on its 4G upgrade. In the third quarter, we entered into an agreement with T-Mobile extending the length of the terms on approximately 2,800 legacy SBA Towers and providing for increased cash escalators for certain period of time in exchange for T-Mobile's rights to deploy 4G equipment on a lesser number of sites. This agreement has since been extended to 520 TowerCo towers, where T-Mobile was a tenant. With the agreements now in place, T-Mobile's working hard to bring 4G to our sites, and that now makes all 4 U.S. carriers extremely busy with us on technology upgrades, positively impacting both our leasing and services segments. Our services segment produced the highest revenue and gross profit in 7 years, with a level of activity that has consistently grown as we move through the year. We expect continued strong services segment contribution for the remainder of 2012 and all through 2013. We had a good quarter building towers and buying or extending the land under our towers. We were tremendously busy in the debt capital markets, raising $2.2 billion in 4 separate transactions in the third quarter alone. We acquired 37 towers in the quarter, as we're ready to close the pending TowerCo transaction. We closed the TowerCo acquisition on October 1, adding 3,256 towers. As of today, we own 16,517 towers and have increased our portfolio year-to-date by almost 60%. The integration of our acquisitions is going very well, and the assets are attracting good demand from our customers. A sizable amount of our backlog relates to these new assets. One of the clear benefits we are enjoying from these acquisitions is the reduction in SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue, reflecting our ability to maximize the efficiency and capabilities of our back office. As Brendan mentioned, SG&A expense has declined as a percentage of total revenue, and we expect additional reductions as TowerCo is reflected in our results of operations. Given our success with these acquisitions and our expectation of being backed within our target leverage range of 7.0 to 7.5x net debt annualized adjusted EBITDA by the end of the fourth quarter, we are ready to continue with additional portfolio growth. We will look both domestically and internationally and believe that we will find some attractive opportunities that will meet our investment requirements. We are once again establishing a goal of 5% to 10% portfolio growth in 2013, while maintaining our target leverage levels. Our initial 2013 guidance reflects a lower level of portfolio growth. And if we are successful in consummating some acquisitions, I would expect our initial 2013 outlook to increase. Speaking of international, we continue to be very pleased with our international activity. International towers have grown to 1,716 at the end of the quarter, an increase of approximately 150% over the year-earlier period. International site leasing revenue grew 121% year-over-year. While U.S. portfolio growth occupied most of our focus this year, we continue to have an interest in expanding our international business into new markets. We expect in 2013, that we will be actively looking for the right new international markets in which to expand as well as continuing to materially grow our existing international markets. Our access to capital and balance sheet are both in great shape. We've had a very successful year in the capital markets. We've termed out all of the debt associated with our Mobilitie and TowerCo acquisitions on favorable terms and interest rates. While our undrawn $700 million revolver plus cash on hand is more than sufficient to satisfy in cash all of our expected obligations related to our 1.875% convertible notes due May 2013. We are planning on some additional debt financing prior to the May 2013 convert maturity. We're planning on this so as to preserve our revolver availability and to ensure that we will be able to stay fully invested to our target leverage range, if we so choose. Our outlook assumes $600 million of such additional debt financing. As our initial 2013 guidance indicates, we expect the current strength in our business to continue into 2013. One of the drivers of this substantial growth we expect to set forth in our initial 2013 outlook is strong, anticipated organic lease up against a much larger portfolio of towers. With respect to organic Tower cash flow growth, we are forecasting materially the same level of incremental organic carrier activity on a cash revenue added per tower basis in 2013 as we expect for 2012. We see a tremendous amount of amendment activity again in 2013. We have included no material contribution in 2013 from any customer that was not reasonably active in 2012, so that would exclude DISH, Clearwire and public safety. Our 2013 outlook includes benefits from the Sprint and T-Mobile agreements to both cash and noncash site leasing revenue, but our Tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO outlooks are all on a cash basis. Total noncash leasing revenue in 2013 is estimated to be approximately $60 million. For those of you doing margin analysis, since our definitions of Tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA exclude noncash items, you need to subtract noncash items from site leasing revenue to calculate margin. When you do, you'll see that we are expecting relatively stable margin performance in 2013, notwithstanding having added a substantial number of lower-margin Mobilitie and TowerCo assets. And this is a result of expected strong organic leasing growth. In our site leasing revenue outlook, we have factored in a churn allowance in the guidance, which includes all known churn plus an additional unallocated amount similar to those churn levels we have experienced during the last couple of years. On the services side, we are expecting another strong year similar to full year expected 2012. With respect to net cash interest, we are assuming 3 month LIBOR remains at or below 0.5% throughout 2013. As is our custom, our outlook includes only those towers we own, intend to build or have under agreement to acquire as of today, and we do not guide to any stock repurchases. As a result, we are today, including our initial 2013 guidance, a level of discretionary capital investment well below 2012 levels and well below our guided AFFO. As I mentioned earlier, it will be our goal to invest additional amounts of capital and portfolio growth or perhaps stock repurchases or perhaps both. Assuming the one additional financing contemplated in our outlook ahead of the maturity of our 2013 convertible notes, we will have significant liquidity that could be deployed for additional asset growth and/or stock repurchases. Based on our estimated 2013 year-end run rate adjusted EBITDA, we could invest approximately an additional $750 million or more into portfolio growth and still maintain our target net debt annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage levels. In the aggregate, we believe our initial 2013 outlook is strong with potential opportunities for improvement throughout the year. Our focus next year is straightforward: Execute well against a favorable macro environment, add quality growth assets and continue to take advantage of what is expected to be a favorable financing market. We expect to, once again, produce material growth across a number of key metrics, including growth at AFFO per share. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. Our employees work really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. They do a great job, our customers recognize that, and as a result, we are a preferred provider for our customers' network needs. Our customers are, and we think will remain extremely busy, improving and expanding their wireless networks. We look forward to continued success as we finish this year and move into 2013. And Lola, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to the line of James Ratcliffe of Barclays.
Sandeep Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is Sandeep Gupta for James. Can you talk about -- for your international business, what's the mix of growth between new tendencies and amendment revenue? And where do you think the international markets are and their growth cycle? And I have a follow up.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: The amendment new cell site split internationally is probably 90-10, 90% new cell sites, 10% amendments, I think reflecting the capacity or -- excuse me, the coverage built stage that a lot of those markets are in. We see them as being several years behind maybe as many as 5 to 10 years behind the U.S., in terms of their development but proceeding on exactly the same path. So we're pretty excited about years to come of good international growth.
Sandeep Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And also about your DAS portfolio. Would you think you're satisfied with the current scale, or you need to scale further through acquisitions?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we really don't have a DAS portfolio. We chose several years ago to be active in that space through our investment in ExteNet, of which we're a sizable minority holder. We sold slightly more than half the DAS assets that we bought from Mobilitie to ExteNet, which Brendan mentioned, and I think we announced the closing of that. So that's how we invest and stay active through the DAS side of things. And we're extremely pleased with how ExteNet is doing, and how that portion of the world I think is going to be -- continue to be an important part of wireless infrastructure.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. First, obviously, it's been really tough up in the northeast with Hurricane Sandy. Hopefully, your employees were okay. But can you update us as far as what impact Hurricane Sandy had on your operations, and how are things currently?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes. First of all, our hearts go out to the people up there, whose lives are still dislocated, and we know there are many. Thankfully, we have no employee issues, other than difficulty in getting around. We have no reported material damage to our towers. There's a lot of power out that prevents cell sites from working, because the battery backups have all run out by now. Our obligations, and we're working hard to do this, is to make sure that our customers have access to the site, cleared roads, ability to get to their equipment and get them up and running. And we feel very confident that we'll be able to do that very quickly. So having said all that, again, while the Sandy thing is a heartache for so many people, we don't really see it having any material impact on our business.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Second question is with the timing maybe of that $600 million financing to take out the 1 7/8 convert. What is your assumption as far as when you would execute that $600 million transaction in the guidance? And then the 3.5% rate that's -- the assumed rate, is that basically signaling to us that you might be able to do securitization on the TowerCo assets?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Brendan, what we assume in guidance, February or March?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: We assume, actually, March. End of the first quarter was the timing assumption, correct.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: And yes, we do expect to try and securitize some of those TowerCo assets in DAS financing. I mean, DAS financing is -- let me say that our first choice at this time would be to do that financing through a securitization, although we certainly left ourself room and have the structural capacity to do it in the bank market as well.
Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I think it's October 14, convert that's out there, the 4% one. Should we think of that maybe being more -- possibly in shares, given how successful your stock price has been and hopefully will continue to be?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: No, I mean we're working to position the company to retire all that in cash, because we believe that the cash that we'll be able to access through the debt markets will have a lower yield than our shares on an AFFO per share basis. And the result and impact on long-term AFFO per share leads towards cash settlement. Now we'll balance all that against leverage and what other portfolio growth opportunities that we have at the time, but we kind of always think about positioning the company to settle these things for cash, Rick.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Just 2 really -- in your prepared remarks, you mentioned seeing strong demand for your new assets. Just wondering if you could give us some kind of color comparison to your other assets, the relative demand. And if demand is different, are you seeing more new sites for the new assets? Or is it still kind of broadly amendment activity. And then secondly, in terms of looking at international markets, just wondering if your focus is still on Latin America, Central America or if you're looking to other geographies?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, Jonathan, the new assets are actually seeing a little more cell splitting, which is what we are -- we're contemplating and banking on. It's not yet to the levels that we expect in years to come as 4G becomes -- the coverage gets built out and then they go back in for capacity, but we're encouraged by the amount of activity that we've seen so far. So you're going to have a higher new cell splitting mix of added revenue on the new assets. In terms of international, we continue to like the Western Hemisphere. But we are open and looking all throughout the world for the right opportunities, as we look to grow the company. But I would have to continue to say that the Western Hemisphere continues to be our bias.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Great. If I could just sneak one more question in. The $750 million or more that you highlighted as potential fuel for further investment in 2013, is that based on the 7% -- pardon me, 7x debt to EBITDA or 7.5x debt to EBITDA?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Probably closer to the 7.5X.
Operator: Next, we'll go next to the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I had a question about ExteNet and to what extent you might anticipate making additional investments or if capital calls or what not, that would represent a use of cash. And then on the iDEN decommissioning that Sprint has announced, I think a lot of the equipment still, actually, needs to be taken down. I'm interested in just some color on what you're seeing in your portfolio and how that might impact your 2013 outlook?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, on ExteNet, Jonathan, we continue to like our investment and continue in general to have a desire to increase our investment. The note that we took back from ExteNet in the sale of the DAS assets is convertible, should we so choose at the time, if ever that they decide to go out and raise additional equity, and we structured that for exactly that reason. So if the world continues to move in the direction that it's moving in terms of DAS and small sells, we will continue to have an interest in expanding our relationship with an investment in ExteNet. In terms of the iDEN, it's a bit unclear to us, because Sprint has the ability to power down its equipment and yet leave the equipment on the sites for certain periods of time. So we don't actually know whether certain item sites are still transmitting or not. We do have rights to perform the services work, to take that equipment down. We haven't done much of that in 2012, and we have some of that in our guidance for 2013. But in terms of what our numbers reflect and whether we have a numeric path to actually confirm or check how much of Sprint's iDEN network is actually powered or not, we can't tell you.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I guess, I was interested more in how the lease terminations play a role in your 2017 outlook.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, we have -- as part of the deal that we cut last year, we have a specified runoff of iDEN termination rights for Sprint, and we have included in our guidance $5 million to $6 million of that revenue loss in our 2013 outlook.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And then on '13, how does it feel to you right now in terms of the seasonality of organic leasing and then the growth compared to 2012? Maybe a little more evenly weighted or markedly back-half-weighted? How does this feel to you right now?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: I think carriers plow right through the year end and go pretty hard right out of the gates in January, based on where we see the projects and what we know of their goals in terms of getting this 4G stuff done. I think it's going to be more equally weighted all through the year.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Can you talk about the M&A environment? You've, obviously, been active in the U.S. but there's fewer large portfolios available. So do you expect that as you grow your portfolio that more of that will likely be international? Do you still think there's good opportunities domestically? And then also, are you starting to see people coming outside in exceeding their MLAs with some of the traffic that we're starting to see on some of these 4G networks? And do you expect some of that next year as well?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, I'll answer the second one first. We are seeing instances where folks who we have entered into an MLA with have come back, and are seeking to install equipment outside or above and beyond the parameters that we agreed to, which results in additional leasing revenue for us. And I do think we'll continue to see that and perhaps even more of it in 2013. In terms of M&A, there has been a number of large deals done this year in United States. There remain a couple, less than a handful, of I think, legitimate opportunities for north of 1,000 towers. I think there's somewhere between 5 and 10 -- between 300 and 800 towers. And then there's a whole still a bunch of smaller M&A opportunities in the U.S. and still a lot of towers being built specifically for later sale to companies like us. So I think our growth in the U.S., Simon, will be -- come from a greater numerosity of transactions, but I do think there'll still be plenty of growth opportunities left. I think the odds of the bigger deal, if we find one we like and if actually move on one, might be international.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: During your comments you talked about some churn assumptions, you've made your guidance, you talked about known churn events and then you added to that, which I think is your usual churn rate. I think it's usually about 1.5%. But the known churn event component, is that principally the iDEN stuff you previously outlined? Or is there another impact we need to be accounting for?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: No, it's the iDEN rep.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then you were talking about seasonality in leasing, and you noted that you expect 2013 to start off pretty strong. In light of the MLAs that you've put in place, how relevant is seasonality to the performance of your business on a reported basis going forward? Is it less significant than it previously was? How do we think about that as we do channel checks and try to figure out what our model should look like based on the actual leasing dynamics within a given year?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: That's a good question. And I think that points out the difference, of course, in the noncash GAAP straight-line results from the cash. The way the T-Mobile deal was struck. The seasonality's not going to matter, because it's now kind of a locked in increase based on increase escalators, which have already started to kick in. On the Sprint MLA, the seasonality would not impact the GAAP revenue, but it would definitely impact the TCF. And I would encourage everyone, as we've now entered into some of these transactions where the GAAP and the cash impacts differ, to pay most close attention to our TCF numbers, our adjusted EBITDA numbers and our AFFO numbers, all of which are cash based. So see, an up or down first quarter wouldn't impact the GAAP recognition on those 2 contracts. Perhaps it would impact the cash reports, so watch the cash.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Richard Choe for Phil. Just a few quick follow-ups. In terms of your new assets, you said you're starting to see some good activity there. When can we actually see that hit its run rate? Will it take a few quarters, maybe within the next year? A little more color on that side would be great.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we're starting to book leases and amendments now. So it's already factoring into the consolidated numbers. But as I mentioned earlier, we expect -- the best is still yet to come as we move on an industry basis through the initial 4G coverage builds into capacity. You're starting to see incremental revenue in our results from those new assets in the third quarter.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And in terms of the service revenue, I guess, you mentioned a good finish to this year, a good level next year. It seems like we're talking about mid to high 20s per quarter. Is this kind of a new level of service revenue that we could see for longer than this year and into next year? Or do you think this is just the level of activity going on -- there's so much going on for carriers right now?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, I think it's the latter, which is so much activity right now, but we see that level of activity continuing through the rest of this year and all through 2013. So -- I mean, we feel pretty good about the strong services numbers, at least, through the end of next year.
Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And just the one final one. I guess, it seems like the business is doing really well, and most of the carriers are doing a lot of activity. Is there any worries with, I guess, AT&T and Verizon kind of pulling back on their CapEx for wireless spending next year and with some of these transactions, between carriers that there will be any pause in activity or people getting a little more conservative until some of these deals close?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we don't see any signs of that, but if it were to occur, pause or a stoppage by either by AT&T or Verizon would change things. Not just given the magnitude of the work that they've been doing, and we expect that they will continue to do, we don't see any signs of that, however.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Jeff, there were reports out yesterday that KPN is going to sell their German tower assets. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on whether that's the sort of Western Hemisphere type international deal that would be appealing to SBA? And then, you also specifically called out you're not putting things like for a standard DISH or Clearwire in the numbers for next year. Can you comment on whether you're seeing any signs of life or activity there, and if so, kind of what kind would be a helpful insight?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, the -- we are looking worldwide, David. You should not assume that we wouldn't be interested in something like that. We'd have to go through the same analysis that we do everywhere, multiplicity of carriers, where are they in their development cycle, rule of law, all those things. So that would be something that you should not rule out that we might be looking at or something like that. The second question -- what was your second question?
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: DISH, public safety.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Where additional things may come from? Clearwire has started to do a little bit around their 4G conversion. But it's not in numbers that we think materially at this point as going to impact 2012 or move the 2013 outlook. DISH is waiting on the FCC. They have folks in place that are starting to think about how they might roll that network out, but it's all really on hold until they hear from the FCC. And public safety's really just getting started. They've had a couple of requests for information that have gone out. I know PCIA, which represents the tower industry, has commented on that. So it's all moving in the right direction. I can't really tell you when it gets to the point of material impact in our numbers. But when we get there, I'll let you know.
David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And if I can just quick follow-up on that, Jeff. Just in terms of kind of looking at the FirstNet website, and how they're planning on architecting their network. It looks like they're planning on putting up their own radios and their own spectrum, but that they want to piggyback on the existing infrastructure, the commercial carriers. Have you thought it all about or talked at all about kind of how that kind of relationship would work from a pricing and contractual flexibility issue? And have they approached you guys to try to see how flexible you guys might be in terms of helping them get this thing built?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes, that was one idea that was submitted, kind of the shared -- kind of almost the LightSquared idea, with respect to Sprint's network that they had last year. I don't know that it's actually locked in, that they're going that direction, David. I will have to see. I mean, if there were elements of sharing either on the ground or on the tower with existing carriers, they'd have to strike that deal with those folks first. It is a concept that we've wrestled with and dealt with before in the context of Sprint and LightSquared. But in terms of do we have anything yet that approaches kind of financial certainty around what that might look like, the answer is no.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research: I wondered if you could walk through the specific puts and takes in your forecast for organic side revenue growth in the '13. We're trying to reconcile -- it looks like they're -- given a very strong side revenue guidance for Q4, it looks like there's an implied slowdown in '13, and I'm trying to reconcile. I know there's iDEN decommissioning, but what are the various puts and takes from escalators to churn, and specifically, iDEN churn that you're using in those numbers?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, the iDEN churn is $5 million to $6 million, plus 1% to 1.5% of unallocated churn, because that's kind of where it's been over the years. There's nothing more -- there's nothing else in the churn numbers. So in terms of the revenue -- I mean the problem with the -- if you're working off the GAAP numbers, Kevin, it's going to be impossible to figure out, with all the puts and takes with the GAAP versus the cash. Keep in mind that as you recognize cash revenue, particularly under the Sprint Network Vision contract, which will increase TCF and adjusted EBITDA, it actually lowers the GAAP revenue. So that probably is what you're seeing. And I would suggest that maybe after this call, you get Mark and Brendan on the line, and we can walk you through all that. But if you're basing your analysis off the GAAP revenue, it's not going to be the right picture.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And next, we'll go to the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I missed the first part of the call, so I apologize if you've talked about this. But now that you seemed to have signed up the MLAs with T-Mobile, I was wondering if you can give us the average lease term of the Big 4 guys? And if you're willing, what the average lease term is for each of the Big 4?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It's 9 with Sprint, 7 with T-Mobile and 4-ish for each of AT&T and Verizon.
Operator: And at this time, no one is in queue to ask a question. I'll turn it back for any closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Great. Thanks, Lola. We appreciate everyone's participation on the call today. Look forward with strong finish to the year. We'll speak with you in 2013. Thanks.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA second quarter earnings call. For the conference, all the participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions; instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. With that being said, I will turn the conference now over to the Director of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good morning and thank you for joining us for SBA second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss in this call is forward-looking including but not limited to any guidance for 2012 and beyond. These forward-looking statements maybe affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night’s press release and our SEC filings which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, August 3, 2012 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com. With that, I will it over to Brendan to comment on our second quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release last night, our second financial and operational results were excellent. We exceeded the high end of our guidance across all of our most important financial metrics including leasing revenue Tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Total revenues were $229.1 million, up 34% of the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $203.6 million or a 35.6% increase over the second quarter of 2011. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth and portfolio growth, including the impact of the Mobilitie acquisition which closed on April 2nd. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue comes from the US and its territories, with approximately 5.7% of total leasing revenue coming from international operations. Site leasing segment operating profit was a $158.8 million or an increase of 34.5% over the second quarter of 2011. Site leasing contributed 97.5% of our total segment operating profit. Tower cash flow for the second quarter of 2012 was $152.3 million or a 28.4% increase over the year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 79.3% compared to 80.1% in the year earlier period. Margins were slightly impacted by the addition of the less mature Mobilitie portfolio and are expected to be similarly impacted by the TowerCo acquisition and then resume their growth thereafter. We continue to experience strong leasing demand both domestically and internationally. Amendments which were predominantly from AT&T, Verizon and Sprint continue to be numerous and contributed approximately 80% of US leasing revenue added in the quarter. The big four US carriers contributed approximately 0.75 of our consolidated incremental leasing activity in the quarter. We have a solid leasing backlog and expect that the third quarter will be another strong one in terms of customer activity. We are off to a good start in the quarter. Our services revenues were $25.6 million compared to $20.9 million in the year earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $4.1 million in the second quarter compared to $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2011. Services segment operating profit margin was 16.1% compared to 13.9% in the year earlier period. SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $17.7 million including non-cash compensation charges of $3.8 million. SG&A expenses were $15.7 million in the year earlier period including non-cash compensation charges of $3.1 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A declined 150 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2011 reflecting the efficiency by which we can materially add assets. Adjusted EBITDA was $142.9 million or a 30.5% increase over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 65.6% in the second quarter of 2012 up from 64.8% in the year earlier period, an 80 basis point increase. AFFO increased 46% to $95.3 compared to $65.2 million in the second quarter of 2011. AFFO per share increased an industry leading 34.5% to $0.78 compared to $0.58 in the second quarter of 2011. Net loss attributable to SBA Communications Corporation during the second quarter was $53.5 million compared to a net loss of $29.8 million in the year earlier period. Contributing to net loss in the second quarter were $15.8 million in acquisition related expenses primarily associated with the Mobilitie transaction and a $27.1 million charge related to the early retirement of a portion of our 8% and 8.25% senior notes. We expect to incur similar type of charge in the third quarter and an anticipated amount of approximately $23 million primarily in connection with the early retirement of our remaining 8% senior notes and the Mobilitie bridge loan. Net loss per share for the second quarter was $0.44 compared to $0.27 per share in the year earlier period. Quarter end shares outstanding were 121.5 million. In the second quarter, we acquired 2,381 towers, a substantial majority of which were from the Mobilitie acquisition and build 90 towers. We ended the quarter with 13,122 owned towers, an increase of 37% versus the year earlier period. 11,488 of the towers were in the US and its territories and 1,634 in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2012 were $923.5 million, consisting of $2.4 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $921.1 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the second quarter includes $887.9 million incurred in connection with Tower acquisition, exclusive of any working capital adjustments and paid earn-outs. A substantial majority of this was the cash consideration in the Mobilitie acquisition. Discretionary CapEx also included $15.6 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress and $5.4 million from gross augmentation and tower upgrades. Of the $5.4 million augmentation figure, approximately $2.9 million or 54% was reimbursed by our customers. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $13.2 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers, including those we acquired for Mobilitie. The average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is 32 years. In July, we entered into an agreement to sell certain DAS assets acquired in the Mobilitie acquisition to ExteNet for a total consideration of $125 million, including $100 million in cash and $25 million in the form of promissory note. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter. These assets produce approximately $8.6 million in run rate annual tower cash flow. The results of these operations are reflected as income from discontinued operations in the statement of operations, but are not included in our calculations of tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. We retained ownership of 3 DAS Networks located in Chicago, which contributed $1.8 million of leasing revenue and tower cash flow during the second quarter. At this point, I'll turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. SBA entered the second quarter with $4.1 billion of total debt. We have cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $109 million resulting in net debt of $4.0 billion. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was seven times. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.3 times.  We were very active in the capital markets during and subsequent to the second quarter. Several of these second quarter events we've already reported and discussed. In April, we issued 5.25 million shares of comment stock to fund the equity portion of the Mobilitie transaction. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with the $400 million bridge loan and the balance from a draw on our revolver.  Also in April, we redeemed a $131 million of principal at each of our 8% and 8.25% senior notes with proceeds from an equity offer and equity offering in the first quarter. In May, we obtained a new five year $200 million term loan which was issued at par and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 2% to 2.5%. The proceeds from this loan we used to pay down announced outstanding under our revolver.  Simultaneous with the term loan A we amended our credit facility to increase the committed availability under our revolver to $700 million and to extend the maturity date out until May of 2017. In July, we issued $800 million of senior notes due 2020. The notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 5.75%.  Proceeds from these offering were used in part to repay the full Mobilitie bridge loan and to repay all amounts barred under our revolver. Also in July we priced the $610 million offering of Secured Tower Revenue Securities. These securities will be issued at par and bear interest at 2.933%. We have an anticipated repayment date of December 2017 and a final maturity date of 2042.  The proceeds in this offering are scheduled to close August 9 will be used to call the remaining $244 million in principal outstanding of over 8% senior notes this month at a price of 106 pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with our pending TowerCo acquisition and for general corporate purposes.  As of the end of the second quarter and pro forma for our July 2 debt offerings, our debt had a weighted average annual cash coupon of 4.4% and a weighted average remaining maturity of 4.6 years. We've reduced our weighted average cost to debt by 20 basis points and extended the weighted average maturity by six months in just one quarter. 86% of our pro forma total debt is fixed rate.  In the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock. We currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. While stock purchases continue to be an important component within our overall capital allocation process, we continue to view them as opportunistic rather than systematic.  We are very pleased with our balance sheet as we ended the second half of 2012. Pro forma for July debt offerings we have long-term financing in place for Mobilitie transaction, $700 million in committed capacity under our revolver, approximately $500 million in cash and committed financing for the TowerCo acquisition. The current capital market is very favorable for the Tower industry and we expect it will continue to provide us with diverse and attractive sources of capital. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you have heard we had an excellent second quarter, one of the best that I can remember. All of the factors that materially contribute to our financial results came together positively in the second quarter and ahead of our expectations. Probably more exciting is our belief that these factors will continue to combine positively for the rest of 2012 and into 2013.  We have had a number of moving parts this year that may make it a challenge to fully appreciate what is going on at SBA, but it really boils down to four key factors that have combined to drive our success. Strong customer activity both domestically and internationally, excellent operational performance across all lines of our business, material portfolio growth with quality assets at attractive prices and successful opportunistic financings executed on every attractive terms.  These four areas which have always been the keys to our success came together in the second quarter in such a way as to permit SBA to post superior growth in Tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and particularly AFFO per share. We expect these four areas will continue to combine together in a positive way for us in the remainder of 2012 and as we move into 2013.  I am going to focus the rest of my comments on several SBA specific points within these four areas which I believe will provide you not only with better understanding of the drivers to our second quarter success but also why we are so excited about prospects for the rest of the year.  Organic growth was and continuous very strong, driven in the second quarter by AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and our international assets. Much commentary about strong wireless CapEx and network upgrades in general that’s been delivered to this earning season for our customers and peers. So I am not going to repeat that here. For SBA we saw continued strength from AT&T and Verizon on amendments and a substantial pick up from Sprint in network provision activity. These three carriers were the primary contributors to our US leasing business. International activity was also strong and came from a variety of customers. International results are ahead of plan and we are very pleased with what we have accomplished in the six countries in which we operate outside of the United States. We had no material contribution in the second quarter from T-Mobile 4G or Clearwire LTE activity and none has yet that included in our 2012 guidance. We are in discussions with T-Mobile on their 4G upgrade program and if and when we do reach an agreement with T-Mobile we would at that time incorporate our expectations around their 4G upgrade into guidance.  We have a lot of runway left around amendments. Between AT&T, Verizon and Sprint we have commenced cash revenue recognition from 4G or network provision amendments on less than 25% of their existing sites through the end of the second quarter, a long way to go. Our backlogs of leases and amendments are very strong and we have clear visibility to continue strong organic growth through the rest of this year and well into 2013. The Mobilitie integration is going according to plan and we expect the TowerCo closing and integration to go very smoothly.  Mobilitie assets are performing to expectation with lease up in the second quarter and a growing backlog moving forward. We believe that TowerCo will close in October and contribute to our fourth quarter results, although we have not included any benefit from TowerCo in our guidance.  Operationally, we continue perform very well and with increasing efficiency, cash SG&A expense as a percentage of total revenue declined to 5.95% from 7.1% in the year earlier period. This operating efficiency helped drive continued increases in adjusted margin which increased to 65.6% from 64.8% in the year earlier period. Once the TowerCo acquisition is closed and fully integrated, we would expect SG&A expense to drop further as a percentage of revenue. As we've previously discussed, we expect incremental SG&A expense required for Mobilitie and TowerCo acquisitions combined to be only approximately $5 million per year to handle an approximate 50% increase in the size of our Tower portfolio.  We had strong operational performance throughout the company including new bills, ground lease purchases and leasing where we handled the highest quarterly volume ever in new lease and amendment transactions. Our services segment in second quarter began to see material work related to Sprint's network provision project, which we expect will continue to increase as we move through this year and into next. Our employees continue to work very hard and efficiently to meet the needs of our customers and I want to thank and applaud our employees for their efforts. We have enjoyed tremendous financing success at the beginning of the second quarter, securing $1.81 billion of funded and committed debt capital. Included in this amount was a $200 million increase to our revolver which is undrawn. $1.41 billion of the total $1.81 billion of debt is fixed rate. The weighted average interest rate for all of these recent financing is 4.1% well below our expectations. Because of our financing success and assuming our sale of DAS assets to ExteNet closes as anticipated, we now expect to draw only approximately $650 million of the $900 million bridge commitment in connection with the closing of TowerCo acquisition. Having successfully funded a good portion of the TowerCo cash consideration in advance will increase our cash interest expense and impact our AFFO for the rest of the year as you can see in the guidance. Our multiple successful financings have not only put us in a good position for the TowerCo acquisition, but have also provided the liquidity necessary to satisfy our only debt obligation due in the next 12 months. Our undrawn $700 million revolver is expected to be more than sufficient to satisfy in cash all of our obligations related to our 1.875% convertible notes due May 2013. We do not need to draw on the revolver to fund the TowerCo acquisition and the expected AFFO generation over the next 12 months should provide plenty of capital for discretionary spending and investment. While we are likely to do some additional opportunistic debt financing prior to the May 2013 convert maturity, so it's not to rely entirely on our revolver. The fact that we can means that we have all the committed financing we need to satisfy all of our debt obligations until the fourth quarter of 2014. Our strong operational performance and lower than expected net debt leverage ratio exiting Q2 allows us to revise our post TowerCo yearend leverage estimate to 7.5 times to 7.7 times pro forma fourth quarter annualized net debt to adjusted EBITDA, at or only slightly above the high end of our target leverage ratio of 7.0 to 7.5 times. This means we will be in a position to resume material investment of additional capital early in 2013. We see SBA as an excellent shape and very well positioned for additional growth. By the end of this year we will have added approximately 6000 towers to our company, over half of which will first begin to contribute materially to our financial results in fourth quarter. This sets the company up for material year-over-year growth for the remainder of 2012 and all through 2013. Adding to the contribution from portfolio growth has been and we expect it will continue to be organic leasing growth in amounts and volumes or size we have experienced in years. We have seen no near term decline in US or international customer activity. Finally our recent refinancings have reduced our weighted average cost of debt, lengthened our maturities and provide us with tremendous liquidity such that we could operate and continue to grow through the fourth quarter of 2014 without the need for any additional financing if we so choose. The combination of all these items makes for exciting prospects around continued material growth and AFFO and AFFO per share. We look forward to reporting future results. John at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And a little one from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: A couple of questions, first on the DAS assets that you are continuing to operate would you look to may be expand that or may be find another purchaser for those assets and then regard to just the traditional macro business ending the quarter I am interested in what kind of link order of lease up pace you are seeing amongst AT&T Verizon and Sprint. 
Brendan Cavanagh: On the DAS assets Jon we are probably going to keep them and work to improve their efficiencies, so we got to work with ExteNet on that and at some point I would expect this to sell those assets to ExteNet as well. In terms of the rank order, I think AT&T was number one, but not by a whole lot over Verizon right and then Sprint was third, but all in very material amounts of activity And I think that’s going to continue to roll through the rest of the year with the possible exception that Sprint may rise in the rankings as the Network Vision amendments really start to accelerate.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: And then with regard to the mobility integration that also respectively to TowerCo, can you just remind us what are the main operational and back office challenges involved in holding in those assets?
Jeff Stoops: Well a lot of it is IT related and movements of data files and making sure that data that comes over is organized the way that we run our company and that process is well under way. There will be some additional field operations, people added. We tend to run that side of our business based on a certain tower count in the geography.  Obviously our tower counts are going up quite a bit and we will probably add a few more sales people around those assets. But those positions are already in the process of being filled and things have gone smoothly so far and we expect that to continue.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Phil Cusick - JPMorgan: Can I just follow up on the (inaudible) Chicago why in extent of its home market, are you holding on to these. Is there an efficiency problem that you can better improve than they can? 
Jeff Stoops: No, we just can’t agree at this point on pricing terms for those assets?
Phil Cusick - JPMorgan: Okay, so as they develop it and everybody will know what's going on?
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
Phil Cusick - JPMorgan: Okay, and then, can you, I want to make sure I heard this right, less than 25% of your tier Verizon sites has been amended so far. Is that right?
Jeff Stoops: No. Combined all of our AT&T, Verizon and Sprint sites, less than 25% of those and in rank order who has amended the most is Verizon, followed by AT&T and then Sprint in third place.
Phil Cusick - JPMorgan: Got it and then as you talked to T-Mobile, so far you sort of avoided some of the MLAs people have done. Are you more inclined to do this MLA with T-Mobile or is not high on your priority list?
Jeff Stoops: All those are high on our priority list for the right terms and again we don’t have a religious opposition to MLAs, it's all about what's best for SBA, both today, looking out the future financially. So we're open and in dialog and you know, will take some resolution, you know, happens here in the not too distant future.
Operator: We will go to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: [Joe Cusick] there. First, a couple of things, on the T-Mobile MLA possibly in the not so distant future, we've seen some people starting to look at MLAs and try and protect from wireless industry consolidation by getting long-term lease extension. How would you kind of frame your thoughts about revenue upside versus churns expectation and wireless consolidation?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think it’s a balance Rick. I mean we would find more and longer-term, both attractive.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, and Jeff to Phil’s question on the AT&T plus Verizon plus Sprint under 25% amount. I assume Sprint excludes the item stuff, so its truly T plus Verizon plus just the CDMA side of Sprint, that's in that number.
Jeff Stoops: Correct.
Unidentified Analyst: And then on the financing, you've done a really good job. Mark’s been really busy as you all have in getting the financings done here in the last few months. When you bring in the TowerCo towers, is there a possibility that you could securitize some of those at pretty attractive rates and what would be kind of the trigger to look at doing that.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean we do intend to continue to access the securitization market. I mean one of the things that we did is we kind of got our unsecured higher costing debt refinancing out of the way with the 5.75% senior notes although on an absolute basis that was a wonderful rate. So the future financings post TowerCo, we positioned to be to fit within the secured buckets that we look to fill and you can assume that some of that will be in the CMBS market. Well, I don't know if you can assume it or not but that's certainly our intent. The TowerCo assets are in great shape. We are actually taking steps today, working with TowerCo to begin securitization readiness stake from those assets and we feel pretty good about our ability to tap that market again post transaction. 
Unidentified Analyst: Great, and the promissory note for the DAS business sale to ExteNet, what kind of form is that going to take and how should we think about how that affects your balance sheet numbers?
Brendan Cavanagh: Well, it's not that big, just $25 million and it accrues interest to 10% and it’s got some healthy terms for us which are designed to give ExteNet the incentive to not leave it out there a whole long time.
Operator: The next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden - Bank of America: Just two, if I could. The first maybe Brendan, could you just tie out the change in the midpoint guidance for us in the revenue and EBITDA; I think that the retention of the DAS business is going to be probably about a little more than half of the revenue change, a little less than half of the EBITDA change from last quarter to this quarter and then the rest of it I guess would be some combination of organic growth and new tower build etcetera. So if you could give us some better breakdown that will be helpful? And then Jeff I think you said during your remarks that said because you are going to end the year at around 7.7 times leverage roughly in line with you debt targets that you are going to be ready to reinvest the capital again into the market. Could you elaborate a little bit, did you mean, starting to go look again at more aggressive portfolio build or did you mean coming back to buyback more stock or both, it would be great? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the guidance change, what you said is basically right. We are adding to our full year guidance about $5.4 million to revenue in Tower cash flow and EBITDA from the inclusion of the DAS assets that we are keeping, that’s about $1.8 million per quarter for the three quarters; obviously we already got that benefit in Q2 and then the remaining $3.6 million for the second half of the year. The balance of the increase is primarily from organic growth, so if you look at site leasing revenue we have increased the midpoint there $9 million less the $5.4 million from the DAS, the balance of that, the $3.6 million is all organic growth, because we’ve signed a very little in terms of new acquisitions. And the same would apply if we got out of Tower cash flow and EBITDA obviously, we did a little bit better on the EBITDA line in Q2, in part because we have a better than expected services quarter as well. But all that baked into increase, so you have got $12.5 million on EBITDA, only about $5.5 million of that is from DAS, the rest is all organic growth.
Jeff Stoops: And on the future investment question David, once we get back to the high end and working our way down on the labyrinth, the high end of our target range of 7.5 times and below, we will once again turn our thinking back to capital investment which has always been a choice for us between portfolio growth, which is our bias and then stock repurchases if those look to be better the old spin or portfolio growth opportunities. So no change in how we will think about things; just really a question of when we get back to that level and I think it’s now going to be sooner than we thought given how well we performed in the second quarter and what our expectations are for the second half of the year. 
Operator: And we will go to Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead. 
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners: First on the ExteNet sale, the sale of DAS assets rather to ExteNet; it looks like you sold it at about 14.5 times Tower cash flow. This might be a good opportunity for you guys to give us a sense as to some of that unrecognized value in terms of your DAS investment, now 14.5 times Tower cash flow seems like a good number? Secondly, in terms of your investment there is there a reason that you chose to take cash plus note as opposed to an increase percentage of ownership? And then I would like to return with a different line of questions. Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, the formal consideration was heavily negotiated in terms of their desire for additional equity issues, our desire for good financial return, where the senior lenders of ExteNet would want to be, so all those things; now even though we’re been already investor there, you can assume it was a robust conversation. And in terms of the value, we’ve never really disclosed how ExteNet is doing on how to start that now, although I will say that based on those multiples, our value of our ExteNet investment is above what we’re carrying in on [that approach].
Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners: One question around the conversations with T-Mobile, you know, in the past the company has talked about a desire to potentially address the anchor tenant arrangement on the Mobilitie assets; is it fair to assume that that has entered part of the conversation?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, it is; although it may or may not be addressed as part of a holistic agreement with T-Mobile, it’s still on the table; but there is a lot of built up, first of all we’ve been a little busy this quarter, T-Mobile has been a little busy, so you know, we have all those opportunities still ahead.
Operator: And we’ll go to James Ratcliffe with Barclays. Please go ahead.
James Ratcliffe - Barclays: Any comment on AT&T’s specially a next wave in the assets from Comcast and Verizon and particularly in long-term, but if they want to deploy those WCS frequencies, what sort of amendment activity would be necessary or would those be covered under typically existing amendments? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: It would all come down to the issue of whether or not new equipment was necessary to transmit that 2.3 GHz level and I don't know the answer yet on that change. That’s pretty new news for us and we're just starting to understand that but it becomes a fairly simple answer to your question. If new equipment is required than it would be necessary for AT&T to come back and talk with us. If not, they would not have to.
Operator: And we will go to Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead 
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Maybe first question just on amendment, obviously very strong activity. You talked about being sort of [80%] incremental activity here and then still lots of room to run given the 25% debt. How are you feeling about the outlook for cell-splitting and kind of where we are and the LTE amendment versus eventual cell-splitting cycle?  And then maybe just second question on T-Mobile assets Tower sale, I know Jeff you talked in the past about you’ve done two relatively large deals this year that seemingly put you out of the market for the T-Mobile Towers but with your comments about the leverage profile and being well into consider stuff sort of beginning of next year when you had to 7.5 churns, you know, that’s portfolio and a deal that would obviously take sometime to close. Are you signaling here that you may be willing to look at those assets at this point going forward? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: I will take the last one first. You should not expect any material big new deals for us announced this year while we continue to work back to our target leverage rate. And in terms of the amendments, you had me so focused on the second one Jason what was the amendment question?
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: The question was really more of a cell-splitting question, obviously we are sort of big amendment cycle at this point, where do you think on the cell-splitting side?
Jeff Stoops: We are seeing from AT&T and Verizon some new tendencies which gives us reason to continue to believe in our base belief which is the driver behind Mobilitie and TowerCo that once the LTE initial roll out is completed there will be capacity infill in cell-splitting. It will be, we will take a variety of forms both macro sites and small cells. There will be plenty of macro sites and we are already seeing some examples where capacity needs are emerging now and are being addressed with new tendencies.
Operator: The next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley:  If you can come back to the future expansion in 2013 I think Jeff in the past you have talked about 5% to 10% portfolio growth annually. Obviously, you have done a lot more than that this year. Is that the sort of thing that you know all other things being equal you should think about for ’13 and ’14 as your sort of your base line target and maybe you can just talk about international versus domestic in terms of areas of focus? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: We will provide some more color on that when we give our full year guidance in our next call Simon. I mean we are getting larger. We will continue to invest. What will be the governing factor and this is how we come up with the statements that we have in about 5% to 10% portfolio growth.  We will be where we want to continue to leverage the business. And if it continues to be in the 7 to 7.5 times range which I feel is appropriate today when most of that investment can go towards portfolio growth with good growth assets. From that we will fall out a number of towers. And that's kind of how we will talk about it in, so I can't really speak to the five to 10 today but this exactly how we will calculate and speak to that issue. And in terms of international versus domestic, we are going to continue look in all those areas, we are having great success both domestically and internationally with lease up and customer activity. So we will take a wide view of where our additional investments will go.
Operator: And next from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael - Cowen: On the TowerCo deal you guys had noted that when that closes it should be immediately AFFO accretive and obviously there's some debt financing that you've not done to make so you guys could get that done. Just curious on the interest rates that you've received on that debt, is that in line with what you are expecting and what are the implications then for the accretion analysis you may have given us initially and what you are expecting now. And then the second question has to do with the 25% of existing sites that you noted who have now been upgraded to LTE for I guess what AT&T, Sprint and Verizon.  Is there a direct correlation and in other words implying then that between going to a higher number and actually what the revenue growth could be because the MLA is out of I think that case of the MLA that you signed with those guys that as you actually start to expand to more LTE on those towers, it might not necessarily be a direct correlation towards the revenue growth could be?
Jeff Stoops: On the TowerCo debt accretion we have done better in our two recent financings than we thought. We actually thought we would do a blend of around 5% between high yields and secured in actuality it was 4.1%. So we did a lot better and actually of course that should have a benefit to the TowerCo accretion, that you mentioned something about having a lined up some more debt, we really don’t have anymore debts lined up. We have a committed bridge facility in place that bears interested LIBOR plus 350. So when roll it all together our matched debt against that transaction will be well below 5%. And in terms of the revenue growth, we only have MLA with Sprint and as we sign up amendments, we've straight lined the revenue so it is all in there and that was the reason why we had a GAAP revenue pick up, but we only recognized the AFFO impact when we actually begin to cash revenue recognition. So we actually do have a lot of additional runway based on where we think that 25 or its actually, its below 25% where we think that number is added, as you look at the impact on cash AFFO.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Larson with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Chris Larson - Piper Jaffray: I wanted to come back to a couple of questions. One was the amendments and I wonder if you could just comment, as you sign these amendments, are you extending out the total lease of those, and then if you could give us a sense for the weighted average lease length for the big four carriers. And then just on that question you just answered on Sprint MLA, is that to imply that -- the question is there additional upside on a GAAP basis for Sprint on the MLA basis or are they already in that 25% or are they greater than that now? 
Brendan Cavanagh: Okay, yes Chris there is with regard to the straight line, there is an upside to the GAAP revenue for Sprint based on timing of when they actually commence those amendments because while it’s in our numbers today, it’s in there at the latest possible date if they are allowed to commence on such that to the extent that they commence some earlier, you would have a pick up. Although albeit a smaller pick up then obviously if it weren’t there at all. And then secondarily to the extent that they are to sign amendments at greater rates than the minimum that they are obligated to that obviously also has a positive impact and we are seeing some of that in the early going at this point.
Jeff Stoops: And on the MLA versus lease extension question Chris, we have again only signed an MLA with Sprint and in connection with that, we did extend leases and I think our average with Sprint CDMA sites is around nine years now. The other three guys average three to four years and they run -- their leases run in the traditional five years with five five-year renewal option cycle. 
Operator: And we will go to Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie: In the outlook section of your press release, it identifies a company intent to spend additional capital in 2012 on acquiring revenue producing assets not yet identified or under contract, the impact of which is not reflecting the 2012 guidance. Basically what you said on the call, there seems to be no major deals, but are there tuck-in deals that you are expecting that could be material in terms of revenue developments this year into next year?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, there will be additional deals, Kevin. I don't know that, that will be material. I suspect they won't, but we will continue to stay active in the mom and pop market and continue. You know we have some additional capital that were interested and prepared to spend, but nothing material while we close TowerCo and work leverage back down to our target range.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie: Also, your international site revenue is 5.7% and that’s pre-TowerCo, you know, given the strong dollar rate now and the cheap borrowing costs, should we expect to see, you guys more aggressive on in Lat Am and internationally in 2013?
Brendan Cavanagh: You know, we like market a lot and what we've done so far in Central America is all dollar denominated. So we like that too. So I think the answer is yes. I mean we like those markets. There are other markets that I think we could like as well, but that’s certainly an area in which we are interested in finding good additional investment.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie: And 10% is still your long-term goal for international revenue mix?
Brendan Cavanagh: It is and again that was really more of a goal to ourselves, you know, something to shoot for. You know, our international business is growing a lot actually on an organic basis, faster than our US business but with both mobility and TowerCo, it's kind of – it's been pushed back a little bit on a pro forma basis. But, yeah that’s still a number that we’re interested in getting to.
Operator:  Our next question is from Imari Love with Morningstar.
Imari Love - Morningstar:  The augmentation CapEx trend, just wanted to get a feel for how you see those lining up in the second half versus the first. They have been running low relative to 2011. Other question was of the 19 acquired towers since the end of the quarter, and you said you have three more that you agreed to purchase. Where are the locations on those?
Brendan Cavanagh: On the 19, I'm embarrassed to say I don't know exactly where they are. They are US towers spread around the country. 
Imari Love - Morningstar: That's what I was asking US versus international.
Mark DeRussy:  Yes, they are US towers. And on location CapEx trends I think, Brendan correct me if you see it differently, but I think the trends are good. We don't see any material increase there and particularly keep in mind that we report gross numbers but actually have over the last couple of years had more than 50% of that cost reimbursed to us by the tenants whose activity requires the augmentation. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I will agree with that. I mean we are seeing more of our sites being touched because of the greater amount of amendments and as a result in some cases we are seeing a little bit of an uptick generally in augmentation CapEx to accommodate the additional equipment. But we are having greater success in terms of recovering those funds from the carriers that are actually causing those augmentation. So on a net basis we are actually doing better.
Operator: And to the presenters, there are no further questions in queue.
Mark DeRussy: Great, I want to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next time. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Later we conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions). As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the Director of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir. 
Mark DeRussy: Thank you, Eddie, good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA’s first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.  Some of the information we will discuss in this call is forward-looking.

The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com. With that, I will it over to Brendan to comment on our first quarter results. 
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, our first quarter financial and operational results were very strong. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance for equity free cash flow and our telecast flow and adjusted EBITDA results were both near the high-end of guidance. Total revenues were $192.5 million, up 14.7% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $172.9 million, or an 18% increase over the first quarter of 2011. Our leasing revenue growth, driven by organic growth, portfolio and a straight line impact of our Sprint network agreement.  The vast majority of our site leasing revenue comes from the U.S. and its territories, with approximately 6% of total leasing revenue coming from international operations.  Site leasing segment operating profit was $137.5 million, or an increase of 20.1% over the first quarter of 2011. Site leasing contributed 98% of our total segment operating profit.  Tower cash flow for the first quarter of 2012 was $132.4 million or a 14.5% increase over the year-earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 80.4% compared to 80% in the year earlier period. We continue to experience strong leasing demand, both domestically and internationally. Amendments, which were predominantly from AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint continue to be numerous and contributed over half of our total incremental leasing revenue added in the quarter. The big four U.S. carriers contributed more than 75% of our total leasing activity in the quarter. We have a solid leasing backlog and expect that the second quarter will be another strong one in terms of customer activity. Our services revenues for the first quarter were $19.6 million, right at the mid-point of our guidance, which compares to $21.3 million in the year earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $2.8 million in the first quarter, compared to $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2011.  Services segment operating profit margin was 14.2%, compared to 11.9% in the year earlier period. We expect increasing volume in our services business throughout 2012, driven primarily by higher network vision activity from Sprint. SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $17.2 million, including non-cash compensation charges of $3 million. SG&A expenses were $15.9 million in the year-earlier period, including non-cash compensation charges of $2.7 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A declined 50 basis points, compared to the first quarter of 2011. We expect SG&A expenses to continue to increase modestly in absolute amounts, but decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA was $121.5 million, or a 15% increase over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 65.9% in the first quarter of 2012, up from 63.7% in the year earlier period; a 220 basis point increase. Equity free cash flow for the first quarter of 2012 was $75.8 million, compared to $63.6 million in the year-earlier period; an increase of 19.2%.  Equity free cash flow per share for the first quarter of 2012 was $0.68 compared to $0.56 in the year earlier period; an increase of 21.4%.  Our strong growth and equity free cash flow per share is a result of solid adjusted EBITDA growth combined with a lower share count.  This quarter, we began reporting funds from operations, or FFO, adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, and AFFO per share, which our conventional metrics reported by real estate investment trusts, as well as by our two public company peers in the tower industry, American Tower and Crown Castle. In the first quarter of 2012, FFO increased 49% to $59.8 million, compared to $40.1 million in the first quarter of 2011. AFFO increased 19.6% to $75.9 million, compared to $63.5 million in the first quarter of 2011. AFFO per share increased at an industry-leading pace of 21.8% to $0.67 compared to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2011. We have provided historical data on these new metrics in our Reg-G disclosure, which can be found in the investor relations section of our website. Given the substantially similar nature of the AFFO and equity free cash flow metrics, we will replace equity free cash flow with AFFO, beginning with our second quarter 2012 earnings release. Net loss attributable to SBA Communications Corporation during the first quarter was $22.6 million, compared to a net loss of $34.3 million in the year-earlier period. Net loss per share for the first quarter was $0.20, compared to $0.30 per share in the year earlier period. Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were $111.4 million, down from $114.4 million in the year-earlier period due to stock repurchase activity during 2011. Quarter end shares outstanding were $116 million. In the first quarter, we acquired 78 towers and built 63 towers. We ended the quarter with 10,661 owned towers, an increase of nearly 15% versus the year-earlier period. 9,289 of those towers were in the U.S. and its territories, and 1,372 in international market. On April 2, we completed our acquisition of the equity interest, certain entities and affiliates of Mobilitie LLT, which entities owned 2,275 towers, indoor and outdoor DAS assets, and had an additional 42 towers in development. Pursuant to the terms of our investment in ExteNet Systems, Inc., we are presently seeking to negotiate a mutually acceptable sale of the DAS asset to ExteNet. As a result, we have excluded projected results from operations of the DAS assets from our second quarter and full-year guidance. Total cash capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2012 were $76 million, consisting of $2.8 of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures, such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx, and $73.2 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the first quarter includes $44.9 million, incurred in connection with tower acquisition, exclusive of $600,000 of working capital adjustment paid earn outs. $17.6 million in new tower construction, including construction in progress, and $4.4 million for gross augmentations and tower upgrades. The augmentation figure is a gross number and does not reflect cash reimbursements paid by our customers. With respect for the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $7.2 million to buy land and easements, and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of 2012, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years, the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers. The average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is 33 years.  At this point, I’ll turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and our balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy:  Thanks, Brendan. SBA ended the first quarter with $3.7 billion of total debt. We had cash, cash equivalence, short-term restrictive cash, and short-term investments of $549 million, resulting in net debt of $3.2 billion. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.5 times. Assuming the mobility acquisition had closed on January 1 of this year, our pro forma net-debt leverage at the end of the first quarter would have been 7.2 times, comfortably within our target range of 7 to 7.5 times. Our first quarter net-cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net-cash interest expense was 2.9 times. As of the end of the quarter, our debt had a weighted average annual cash coupon of 4.6% and a weighted average remaining maturity of 4.1 years. 81% of our total debt was fixed rate.  We were very active in the capital markets during and subsequent to the first quarter. In March, we issued 6 million, 5,000 shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering, which generated approximately 284 million in gross proceeds. In early April, we used the proceeds from the equity offering to redeem 131.25 million in principal of our 8% notes due 2016, and 131.25 million in principal of our 8.25% notes due 2019, and to pay the applicable premium.  This transaction with result in annualized cash interest savings of $21.3 million, and was immediately accretive to AFFO per share.  Simultaneous with the closing of the Mobilitie acquisition, we amended our credit facility to increase the committed availability under our resolver from $500 million to $600 million. We drew down a portion of our revolver to fund the Mobilitie transaction. Also simultaneously with the closing of the Mobilitie acquisition, we entered in to a separate credit agreement for a $400 million bridge loan, which will mature on April 1, 2013. The bridge loan currently bears interest at the euro dollar rate, plus 3.5% or approximately 3.75% today. The proceeds from the bridge loan and borrowings under the revolver were used to fund the cash portion of the Mobilitie transaction. The balance of the purchase was funded with the issuance of 5.25 million shares of common stock. In the first quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock. We currently have 150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. While stock purchases continue to be an important component within our overall capital allocation process, we continue to view them as opportunistic rather than systematic.  We believe our balance sheet is strong, our credit profile attractive, and that current – and that the current capital market environment should provide us with diverse and attractive sources of growth capital. We are currently in the market to further increase our revolver and issue term debt, the proceeds of which would be used to reduce revolver balances. At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops:  Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. As you have heard, we are off to a great start to the year, exceeding our internal plan across key financial metrics. We expected 2012 to be an active year for our customers, and the first quarter has solidly met those expectations. AT&T and Verizon remain very active, and Sprint now seems to have fully engaged in the network vision project. Specific site level activity with Sprint increased materially in the first quarter. We also saw a good start in February, T-Mobile announced their plans to add LTE, which is anticipated to occur through a technology overlay in a manner similar to other nationwide carriers, and which we believe will be the focus of much of T-Mobile’s tower level CapEx this year. We are in the process of discussing the terms, economics and timing of the overlay with T-Mobile, and while we expect work to start on this overlay this year, it is unclear to us at this point whether or not we will recognize any revenue from the overlay in 2012. We are also seeing similar strong demand from our international customers. Carriers continue to enhance and upgrade their networks to next generation technology, to keep up with strong secular demand for high-speed wireless data. We expect to benefit from these factors for the next several years as carriers build out their initial coverage footprints to be followed by capacity spending as consumer adoption increases. In anticipation of continued strong demand for wireless infrastructure, we have been very busy growing our company. In the last six months, we have added over 3,000 towers to our portfolio, increasing the number of towers we own by over 30%. Towers were added in all seven countries in which we operate, with the biggest addition being the closing of the Mobilitie transaction on April 2.  A top priority for us is to complete the integration quickly, smoothly, and to recognize maximum efficiencies. The simulation and integration of those towers is going well, and we expect the process will be fully complete in the next quarter or two. We continue to believe that we will see good additional opportunities for portfolio growth as we move through the year. That belief was the driving factor behind our decision in March, after we announced the Mobilitie acquisition, to issue 6 million shares of common stock, the proceeds from which were used to retire 35% of our [inaudible] debt. That transaction restored our pro forma, post Mobilitie leverage to pre-transaction levels, and put us back within our target leverage range, restoring our positioning for additional portfolio growth. We were very pleased with that transaction, as we were able to issue equity and reduce debt in a manner and at a price that was immediately accretive to equity free cash flow per-share and AFFO per-share. In addition to the equity issuance, we have taken and are taking a number of steps to restore our capital resources and liquidity to pre-mobility levels. We have closed on 500 million of debt financing at an average interest rate of LIBOR plus approximately 325 basis points, and we are currently in the market to raise up to an additional 300 million of increased revolver capacity and term loan debt, which we expect we will be able to access at very attractive rates. With our increased view around AFFO for the year, we expect to have substantial resources and liquidity with which to move forward to continue to grow our portfolio. We expect our additional portfolio growth in the U.S. and Canada will come from a mix of acquisition and new builds, while it will be mostly all new builds in Central America.  We continue to be in the middle of a large greenfield build in Costa Rica, which was the single biggest source of our new tower builds in the quarter, and expect to be for the year, although we will build towers in all of our countries this year. Internationally, we continue to grow materially. Today we own almost 1,600 towers outside the United States and its territories. We are very pleased with our international progress and financial results. We have established ourselves as the preeminent tower company in the countries in which we operate, in terms of resources and the number of towers we own.  We expect to be presented with more opportunities for growth in these countries. We will also continue to review opportunities in additional countries for a potential fit to our business model. As you can see from our new guidance, we expect the Mobilitie acquisition to materially increase almost all of our financial metrics this year. Beyond the positive impact from the Mobilitie, we see continued strong demand for our assets and services as we move through 2012 and beyond. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. We have been very busy these last three months, and I am proud of our efforts.  Our employees work really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. Our customers are and we think will remain extremely busy improving and expanding their wireless networks. Our employees do a great job, our customers recognize that, and as a result, we are a preferred provider for our customers network needs. We look forward to continued success as we move through 2012. Eddie, at this time we’re ready for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). We have our first question from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets,. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets:  Good morning, a couple questions. With regard to DAS and ExteNet do you foresee any future capital calls or capital contributions to that entity?  And then with respect to the S-band, I just wondered if you’re seeing any preparations for a build-out of those licenses?
Jeffrey Stoops:  Not yet on the S-band question, Jonathan. We haven’t see any real tangible signs of that, although those folks know we are in the business of leasing tower space. So it would not be – it would be unusual for us to be kind of the first folks in the loop there. In terms of DAS and ExteNet, you know, we don’t have any additional obligation to contribute capital to ExteNet. I think as ExteNet grows and they do desire to grow, there will be a need for additional capital there, and they will look to their existing investors to supply that capital. And we’ll be happy to look at that at that time, and all things being equal without really knowing what the terms are yet, we would have an interest increasing our investment in ExteNet, but we have no obligation to do so. 
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets:  And then on augmentation CapEx, how do you anticipate that trending in terms of dollar amounts compared to the most recent quarter? And if you could maybe remind us what portion of your recent amendment applications require you to contemplate deploying augmentation capital to the site?
Jeffrey Stoops:  I’ll let Brendan speak to the trends. But in terms of the percentage, about 10% of our leasing activity requires some type of augmentation. You know, most of which, historically and currently, gets reimbursed to us by the customer.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, Jonathan, on the trends, we’re not seeing that much of a change from what we’ve seen over the past year, generally speaking, with some of the changes in the wind loading requirements. As the carriers amend their leases, we’re having to do some augmentations to bring them up to code. But that really isn’t that different now than it was a year ago because we’ve had a substantial amount of our leases upcoming from amendment activity for now the last two years.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets:  Thank you very much.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Phil Cusick – JP Morgan:  Hey guys, a couple of things. You know, first if I look at the guidance given the strength in the first quarter and the strong Q2 guidance, it seems like second half implies a little bit of a slowdown on the year-over-year basis. Is this a level of conservatism, or is there something you see coming that things ease off a little bit in the second half?
Jeffrey Stoops:  I don’t think we read it that way. I think we have guided to a relatively steady full-year level of activity. And, you know, maybe walk us through your analysis, Phil, offline, but we really don’t see it. There’s certainly nothing that we know of today that would cause us to think that organic leasing demand is going to be dropping over the course of the year. We do not believe that, we think it’s going to stay strong.
Phil Cusick – JP Morgan:  Is it fair to assume that Sprint and T-Mobile are pretty backend loaded and much more impactful on ’13 than ’12. 
Jeffrey Stoops:  Certainly on the T-Mobile LTE overlay project, and as far as Sprint is concerned, yes we believe that SBA will have a bigger 2013 on this network Vision, CDMA overlays, then we will have in 2012.
Phil Cusick – JP Morgan:  Last thing, you know the revenue share of the mobility assets with T-Mobile, this seems to be an opportunity to capture some value if you could maybe by that revenue share from them. Has there been any discussion of that, or is that under consideration?
Jeffrey Stoops:  Well, I think your identification of that opportunity is absolutely correct, and it is something that, you know, could be a possibility. And rather than playing that out in public, why don’t I just say that it’s an idea that we are aware of.
Phil Cusick – JP Morgan:  Thank you guys.
Operator:  Our next question is from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James:  Good morning. A couple of questions. First, we appreciate the AFFO that’s nice to have the industry all reporting that. Can you confirm, is your definition the same? I assume you guys kind of looked at all the details of what American and Crown are doing. I just wanted to confirm, is it the exact calculation same way?
Jeffrey Stoops:  We believe it to be.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James:  The second question on the guidance that I assume - - Have you explicitly put in T-Mobile and/or Clearwire anterior guidance yet, or are you still waiting for it to show up in ’12.
Jeffrey Stoops:  We’re still waiting.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James:  Then Jeff, when you mentioned that you thought T you’re looking at, would there be much revenue recognition in ’12. You would think with their announcement in February, hopefully they’re working on their plans now. You would think there would still be a little bit coming in ’12 with the majority coming in ’13 just for them to get active.
Jeffrey Stoops:  Yes, I think that’s very likely. But until we actually start getting, you know, amendments on our sites, and understand what the timing of the revenue recognition is, we’re going to be very conservative around that. I mean it’s all going to happen. It’s just a question of is it Q4 or Q1 or how much in each. I will say that the activity around T-Mobile seriousness and moving forward here is pretty high.
Brendan Cavanagh:  Wait for the whites of the eyes and the green of their cast to show up. 
Jeffrey Stoops: We’ve usually found that to be the better way to go.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James:  Just on quick one on DAS. You mentioned you were looking at selling it by the end of 2Q. Would that be a sale that you would get cash, increased equity, (inaudible). How should we think about what the proceeds might look like?
Jeffrey Stoops:  The obligation is for cash. What we actually end up doing, you know, could be a mixture of things Ric. We’re looking for a win-win situation for both SBA and ExteNet here. So, we’re going to try to stay flexible as we see where this ships out.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James:  Thanks Jeff.
Operator:  Our next question is from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks guys for taking the questions. A couple, just looking at the discretionary CapEx guidance, guys and then comparing that to your Mobility. You know, if I take last quarters discretionary CapEx number, subtract it from this quarter’s number, compare it to the 1.1 billion that you spent with Mobility and adjust for the $30 million in new tower sales, it suggests that you guys are putting in about a $237 million dollar fail value for the DAS business in there. I was just wondering if you could kind of confirm or alter that analysis as necessary? Then, second, Jeff if you could kind of talk us through not just the Sprint side of the transaction, but as we look ahead for the next two or three years, could you kind of refresh our memory about how you see the net of Sprint and the Nextel network shutdown, which Sprint recently announced they want to accelerate, is going to impact the business? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh:  Hey David it’s Brendan. On the CapEx that guidance and our disclosure around discretionary CapEx, the discretionary cash CapEx, so the equity portion of the Mobility deal, is not reflected in those numbers.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got it.
Brendan Cavanagh:  When you’re looking at the increase from last quarters’ guidance to this quarters’ guidance, which includes Mobility, there’s $850 million dollars of cash CapEx associated with the purchase price on Mobility. So, I think when you take that into account that will help you. There is no assumption around proceeds from the DAS sale netted out of there. So, this is just a pure gross CapEx without any assumptions around what we’re going to get back there.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: So, you’ve taken it out of the numbers, but you put nothing in to reflect any possible sale or other adjustment.
Brendan Cavanagh: We have slightly adjusted our net cash interest expense, which would be reduced due to the pay down with the use of some proceeds from that. But, the CapEx line would not change.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Got it. 
Jeffrey Stoops:  As far as looking forward David on the item, as we’ve described previously, the deal that we have with Sprint gives them the right to stage terminations of most, but not all of their item leases with us over a period from the middle of 2013 through the end of 2015. So, we expect to see continued growth, you know, while those terminations may cause our growth to be slightly less than it otherwise would have been, it’s still going to be in our expectation, you know, positive growth along all the major financial components moving forward. But the period of time in which those terminations are allowed to be facilitated by Sprint, is the middle of 2013 through the end of 2015.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Got it. Could you just refresh our memory? So, if we assume that they are going to come off, 13,14,15 roughly equally, what percentage of revenue, potential headwind offset by the CDMA growth are we talking about? 
Jeffrey Stoops:  We’re down to total item exposure is around, you know, 6%. And we believe that roughly the rest of the agreement we cut with Sprint, which is CDMA refresh across all sites and some changes in the cash escalators will approximately offset that loss. Assuming it all occurs as Sprint has the right to terminate.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got it. All right, thanks Jeff. 
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Chaplin – Credit Suisse: Thanks, good morning, guys. I’m wondering if you could comment a little bit on the organic? If you leave aside the impact revenues you’re seeing from the LTE upgrades and network vision, just what you’re seeing in just organic cell sight growth from the four major carriers to satisfy capacity requirements?
Jeffrey Stoops: You’re talking about brand new macro-sites right?
Jonathan Chaplin – Credit Suisse: Yes, exactly.
Jeffrey Stoops: Opposed to overlays or equipment added to existing sites?
Jonathan Chaplin – Credit Suisse: Exactly.
Jeffrey Stoops:  You know we’re seeing some of that but we’re not seeing as much as we have in years passed where carriers were not more fully focused on overlays. I don’t think that should come to a surprise as anyone. It certainly doesn’t come as a surprise to us. It’s very logical. It actually reminds us of how Verizon handled the EVDO Rev-A upgrade and a few others handled technology upgrades in the past.  So with budgets now being directed towards getting these overlays done and getting 4G deployed on a nationwide basis, you would expect to see less brand new macro-sites, and we are. But we do think as that happens, again with history – as the overlay comes to a completion with history as our guide, we expect that’s when the macro-site capacity infill cell splitting will really pick up.
Jonathan Chaplin – Credit Suisse: Got it, then one housekeeping question. On the mobility – on the sale of the DAS business, is there one quarter’s worth of DAS revenue and EBITDA in guidance or is there no DAS revenue or EBITDA in guidance at all?
Jeffrey Stoops:  There is no DAS revenue in any of the guidance.
Jonathan Chaplin – Credit Suisse:  But you’ll collect from April, assuming you sell it at the end of the quarter, you’ll collect one quarters worth of revenue in EBITDA right?
Jeffrey Stoops:  You will but the reason we did not include is it when you sell that business it will get discontinued line of business sale treatment under GAAP and we probably would’ve backed that out of results anyway. I mean we’ll get the cash but it probably would not show up in our GAAP numbers because of the accounting treatment. 
Jonathan Chaplin – Credit Suisse: Got it, yes.
Brendan Cavanagh:  Yes. Those assets would be considered assets held for sale and the financial operating results would go through discontinued operation. But potentially, I mean, if it doesn’t end up getting sold it’ll come back in and we’ll have to adjust for that.
Jonathan Chaplin – Credit Suisse: Okay thank you very much
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners:  Great, thanks for taking the questions, a few here if I may. First in terms of some of the M&A activity that’s gone on, there’ve been three large ground lease portfolios which exchange hands in the last 12 months or so. That’s been something where you’ve guys have been a little bit more incremental work and I was wondering about your perspective on that.  And then secondly, I was wondering if you could give us some color on Verizon’s 700 megahertz rural build out program, whether you’re seeing any participation there, have an impact on your business? And then finally, the international business really scaled as a percent of revenue in the quarter and I was wondering if that was due to particular markets coming online or something else behind the numbers? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops:  On the M&A, Jonathan, you know we looked at everything including those ground lease portfolios and while they’re good assets and will produce long term growth, we didn’t really see any strategic point in those portfolios. Just like we looked at everything else, it really comes down to a financial analysts and we just decided we saw better opportunities elsewhere and mobility is, you know, perhaps the best example of that.  In terms of Verizon 700 rural build out, we are seeing some activity there, you know, with some of the partners that Verizon has chosen. It’s certainly incrementally positive, but it’s not necessarily material to our results.  And international is ramping up nicely, the first quarter reflects the first full quarter of our 580 tower acquisitions that we completed in Central America in the fourth quarter. So I would say most of the increase, you know, stems from that but we’re thrilled with how International’s going in general. It’s up to 6% of revenue now, that may actually scale back a little bit as mobility enters the picture, but we expect it will continue to grow quickly and we’re excited about it and looking forward to continuing our activities.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: Thanks, just one more if I may. In terms of the equity callback feature in the two – the 8 and the 8 ¼ notes. Have you guys fully exhausted that at this point?
Brendan Cavanagh:  Yes we have.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question is from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much, good morning. On the International portfolio, you talked about looking for opportunities there. Are you considering expanding outside of that Central America and Canada? If you could give a little bit more color there. And then if you could just talk after finally closing the mobility transaction, could you talk just a little bit more about the opportunities you see there around things like lease-up opportunities and efficiency gains and so forth, any updated thoughts? Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks Simon. You know International expansion we continue to look for more opportunities. Our focus continues to be in the Western hemisphere, so you know, you should assume that that really leaves South America as a point of interest for us. You know, we will look outside the Western hemisphere, there are a lot of benefits for us to stay in the Western hemisphere; language, a proximity to South Florida, travel, same time zones, things like that. So I would rank that first but not necessarily the only place we’ll be looking, you know, as we move forward.  In term of mobility, while it’s early yet, you know, we’re very pleased with how things are going so far; the lease up, pipeline continues to move through, the assimilation is going well, we’ve think the assets are very good quality. And as we you know stated from the beginning with respected it’s transaction, we think these towers will be ideally situated when we get to the cell splitting capacity infill stage that we believe will follow the basic 4G overlay roll outs.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: When do you see that? If they’re all set in general to complete in ’13. So do we some cell splitting late ’13 or is it really ’14 and ’15?
Jeffrey Stoops:  I think you may see some in ‘13 – I mean, they’re going to start identify areas before that and we’ll realize – I think they’ll know where some of the needs are. The question will be where are the budget dollars? But I think that’s right, you start see it in ‘13 and then in earnest in ’14 and beyond.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Jeffrey Stoops: Any other questions, Eddie? 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays. Please go ahead.
James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital:  Morning, thanks for taking the question, just two if I could? Just first of all, if you could talk a little bit about your willingness to raise exposure to T-Mobile. I mean at this point, you’re clearly with mobility above the industry and how you think about customer concentration. And secondly, if you just give us an update on the build-to-suit market in the U.S. if there’s been a change in that at all, but still the economics are kind of challenging. Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops:  Yes, on the customer concentration, James, T-Mobile now pro forma for mobility is about 18% of our site leasing revenue. So that would be third behind AT&T and Sprint and slightly ahead of Verizon.  You know, we look at customer concentration, we think T-Mobile is in excellent credit. I think the real issue there is not credit worthiness but, you know, potential consolidation down the road, which, you know, we would certainly take into consideration as we looked at future opportunities. But as they credit, I’m not sure how you couldn’t be comfortable with T-Mobile.  In terms of BCS, you know, this ties in a little with what I said earlier about where the carriers are sending their dollars, brand new cell sites versus amendments and overlays. You know, the BCS market, particularly where it’s an RFP or competitively bid process, we do find competitive. We don’t really get most, if any, of our new builds from that type of process.  Our new builds are more relationship driven, strategically driven by our own intelligence out in the market where good spots are.  I don’t know that the economics are changing so much out there, there is, you know, again because all four carriers are now focused on amendments and overlays versus necessarily new builds, and I don’t want to overstate that because there’s still plenty of new builds going on, but to the same degree that perhaps there were a couple three years ago and we think that all comes back as, you know, you get into the cell splitting and the overlay process. So we don’t really see that as affecting us that much, again because we don’t really play in the build to suit RFP competitive bid processes.
James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs:  Thanks good morning, couple of questions. Just maybe on the guidance hike, if you can offer up a little bit more granularity on what dollar amount you assume for mobility over the course of the year, what dollar amount is associated with other tower additions you had in the quarter, and then what you left out from the sale of the DAS assets?  And then second question, it seems like the variability in the range of outcomes attached to lead the Metro certainly has increased. Can you just remind us of revenue exposure to those two companies? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh :  Hi Jason, this is Brendan, I’ll take the guidance question. So for the full year, we've assumed mobility contribution for tower cash flow is around 44 million and adjusted EBITDA contribution of around 42 million. And our revenue contribution is approximately 77 million. The balance is primarily made of up of the new M&A that we signed up, which is relatively small. You’re looking at EBITDA, you’re talking basically about $1 million from the M&A that we’ve signed up since the last time that we gave guidance. The rest of the increases a combination of the beat in the first quarter and some other small things around organic growth. But generally it’s made up of mobility and those other two small things.  The DAS component it’s basically $16 million annually of TCF and EBITDA, and we’ve left out, you know, three quarters of that at this point, give that we close mobility at the beginning of this quarter.
Jeffrey Stoops:  In terms of lease and Metro, Jason, Metro is I believe around 3% of site leasing revenue and I think lease is around 2.
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs: Great that’s helpful thanks guys.
Operator:  Okay, our next question is from the line of Suhail Chandy from Wedbush. Please go ahead. 
Suhail Chandy - Wedbush Securities:  Thank you for taking the question. Two questions if I may. One, how has – given that your leverage ratio is now back in the target range and given your exposure to T-Mobile in performer up to 18%, how does that change your [Inaudible] for potential qualification in T-Mobile stock portfolio?
Jeffrey Stoops:  Well it's kind of like the prior question, we would take credit concentrations and customer concentrations into consideration and things that we do. You know, our leverage is back to where it was pre-Mobilitie and we did the Mobilitie transactions through a combination of debt and equity financing. And we would be looking at similarly sized opportunities the same way. We're very much focused on being around our target leverage range and not exceeding it for long periods of time, so all of that gets taken into consideration as we look at future opportunities. 
Suhail Chandy - Wedbush Securities:  Last question, in your presentation you mentioned that you agreed to pursue an additional 116 towers, could you give us location of those towers? In the U.S. or overseas?
Jeffrey Stoops:  They are mostly in the US. There are some in Canada, but most of them are in the US. 
Brendan Cavanagh:  Some in Canada, most in U.S. 
Suhail Chandy - Wedbush Securities:  Thanks. 
Operator:  Okay, our next question is from the line Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank:  Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. Now that we are several quarters into the LTE build of both Verizon and AT&T, I'm just wondering what are you seeing on some of the original sites that they hit with those upgrades. Are you finding that they're already coming back to add additional capacity or going to new levels, or is that an opportunity you still see mostly in front of you?  And then secondly, a lot of the 700 license holders have build-out requirement, geographic build-out requirement they need to meet by the middle of next year, I was wondering if you're already starting to have some sort of license preservation build out discussions with those license holders? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops:  Yes, on the later one, it's not really license preservation, I think they're really going fast actually to get the stuff deployed, particularly at AT&T and Verizon. And on the equipment, I'm sure, Brett, that we are seeing repeated touches to the tower where new equipment gets added even after the first 3G or 4G installations occur. There is some fine tuning and additional equipment being added. So there really is a continuous process. 
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank:  Just on that first question about the build-out requirements, the licenses are concentrated to AT&T and Verizon, but there's a fairly wide number of holders, are you starting to see people you usually haven't done business with, whether it's Cox, World Providers, or even just spectrum speculators who are coming to you, or maybe that's just something they'd have to deal with later in the year or early next year?
Jeffrey Stoops:  Yes, I haven't seen much of that yet. 
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank:  Okay, thank you. 
Operator:  The next question is from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research:  Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about internal growth with respect to what you saw in the 1st Quarter and what the internal growth in dollars anticipated to be within the guidance you laid out for 2012. Thanks. 
Jeffrey Stoops:  Yes, I'll let Brendan speak to the numbers, but the point that I think is worth discussing on that topic Mike is we talk from the start of our guidance first put out in November pretty robust view of growth in 2012, and we are actually pleased to say that that continues and we continue to have a robust view for the rest of the year. So we've been really expecting this for quite some time and we actually are pretty proud of the precision by which we can guide to our expectations and actually meet those. But in terms of the organic component Brendan can you give Mike some…
Brendan Cavanagh:  Yes. I mean, Mike we're looking, it's changed a little bit with the Mobilitie aspect and their makeup, but we're looking at approximately 8% of organic growth and that's a combination of obviously new lease amendments as well as escalators net of turn. So we’ve historically been in the 8 to 9% range and now we're still holding in there but probably a little bit less simply because of the size.
Jeffrey Stoops:  Yes, and to be clear there is no change around our pre-Mobilitie view of lease. We view very strongly, we continue to view it strongly, and when you factor in the Mobilitie assets with the revenue share component that's where you end up. 
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank:  Thank you very much. 
Operator:  Your next question is from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company Please go ahead. 
Colby Synesael – Cowen & Co.:  Great, just two questions if I may. Number one, as it relates to the AFMO guidance there's about a $33 million range between the low end and the high end, just curious if you could talk to us about what would actually have to happen to put you towards the low end or towards the high end? What's the biggest impact that could get us toward the bottom or the high end? The other question I have is do you have to do a T Mobile, as relates to their 4G LTE build out is it your expectations that these guys will go and find an MLA and if so, is it your expectation it'll probably be fairly similar to the one that you signed with Sprint? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops:  Colby, on the ASFO guidance, the range of ASFO is really a function of several components, one being, the main one being adjusted EBITDA and the other large ones being net cash interest expense, as well as our nondiscretionary CapEx. So basically the range is set based on the size of the ranges of each of those things, and if we were at the worst end of each of those other items, we’d be at the low end of the ASFO guidance. And vice versa, if we were at the high end of all those items we'd be at the high end of the ASFO guidance. [Inaudible] is a function of those components, but we tend to focus on the midpoint as being the likely outcome and that's where we focus, and it's very unlikely that we would be $15, $16 million, which I believe is the swing to the low end from the midpoint. 
Brendan Cavanagh:  Yes, I mean, interest is a big component of that, but most of our interest costs are fixed, so we don't really think of that as being a huge variable. It would really be in the tower case flow and EBITDA lines. We don't really see low end as being a realistic worry. 
Colby Synesael – Cowen & Co.:  Yes, I guess what I was getting at was fundamentally what's the biggest impact that could swing that number?
Jeffrey Stoops:  Given the fact that Mobilitie is new, we're taking a bit of liberty with the range that we put out there, but you should not really take that to mean that our business is any less precisely predictable than it has been over the years. And in terms of your second question, refresh my memory, what was that one again?
Colby Synesael – Cowen & Co.:  Just asking about TML and likelihood of signing an MLA…
Jeffrey Stoops:  You know, a master agreement could be possible. If we can reach an agreement on all the specific terms and conditions including the specificity with which the equipment would be listed and identified, there's a lot of different moving parts in the Sprint agreement. So other than calling it a master agreement that would probably be the only similarity between the two. If we do something TML in that area it should be much more straightforward and almost single issue specific. 
Colby Synesael – Cowen & Co.:  Great, thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question is from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Please go ahead
Kevin Smithen – Macquarie Securities : Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about a little bit about your relationship with ExteNet? It appears from industry data that DAS would grow at two to three times the rate of Microsites in the U.S. and I guess, you know, wouldn’t it make sense to either kind of bring this in, in-house, or if you’re not interested in running a DAS business, you know, why not IPO it while the growth rates are still really strong? Either way it seems like you’d be creating value.
Jeffrey Stoops:  Yes, we have high hopes and expectations from that, and our ExteNet investment. I don’t think, Kevin, you know, we …
Brendan Cavanagh:  I don’t want to speak to what ExteNet is a separate and independently run company. You know, remember we’re just a minority investor that has a say but not the say on how things go. And we’re, you know, continuing to work and help ExteNet grow. And as I mentioned earlier, we do have an interest on the right terms and conditions to increase our investment. I mean you should read that as a positive relationship and a positive interest in the business segment in ExteNet going forward. You know, where and when and how that actually plays out is yet to be determined.
Kevin Smithen – Macquarie Securities : Thanks it’s helpful.
Operator:  The next question is from the line of Chris Larsen with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Chris Larsen – Piper Jaffray:  Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of them. First, to clarify on your Sprint comments, you talked about the contract going through 2013 to 2015. With that, you said something about, inferring growth throughout that contract. Does that infer that Sprint’s contract with you will be sequentially increasing through that entire period? Secondly, are you seeing any activity out of DISH, given that they’re hoping to get their licenses in the not-too-distant future? Third question if I may, Metro PCS is talking about deploying [inaudible]. Can you quantify any sort of impact that might have if [inaudible] begins to take off with either them or anyone else for that matter? 
Jeffrey Stoop:  I’ll do the DISH activity first. We haven’t seen any of that yet. You know, we’re watching all the reports that you’re watching. And again, as I mentioned earlier, you know, they know we’re here to lease space. I don’t know that they necessarily need to seek us out first, but we have not seen any activity yet. The Sprint [inaudible] comments were specifically limited to just the [inaudible] component of the agreement that we have with Sprint. There’s a staged ability for Sprint to terminate, you know, most but not all of the [inaudible] sites that they have with us. And that again is middle of 2013 to the end of 2015, and it will have an impact on, you know, growth rates during that period of time if they choose to exercise those, but not anything that we think is overly material. Particularly when, you know, you have to offset from the CDMA site as well. And on the final question, microwave obviously that is a plus for our industry. Microwave, installations can run anywhere from, you know $250 to $300 dollars a month for a small single microwave dish, to over $1000 dollars if it’s a 2-way microwave, a send and receive installation. So, we’re always hopeful that microwave as a form of backhaul continues to increase in this country the way that it is in Europe and other places.
Chris Larsen – Piper Jaffray:  Great, thank you very much.
Operator:  Our next question is from the line of (Zach Corbett) with Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Mark DeRussy, Director of Finance. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark DeRussy: Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA’s fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2012 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night’s press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we may make. Our statements are as of today, February 24, 2012, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. Our comments today will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan to comment on our fourth quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, our fourth quarter financial and operational results were very strong. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance for site leasing revenues, and tower cash flow, and produced adjusted EBITDA and equity free cash flow at the high-end of our outlook. Total revenues were $183.8 million, up 11.1% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $165.1 million or a 17.9% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010. Our site leasing revenue growth was driven by organic growth, portfolio growth and the straight line impact of our Sprint Network Vision agreement. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue comes from the US and its territories with approximately 3.4% of total leasing revenue coming from international operations. Site leasing segmenting operating profit was $131.2 million or an increase of 18.8% over the fourth quarter of 2010. Site leasing contributed 98.3% of our total segment operating profit. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $127.5 million or a 14.6% increase over the year earlier period. As is our custom, tower cash flow excludes any non-cash straight-line benefit from our Sprint Network Vision agreement, or any other source. Tower cash flow margin was 80.5% compared to 80.3% in the year earlier period. Operationally, we are experiencing strong leasing demand both domestically and internationally. Amendments, which were predominantly from AT&T and Verizon, continue to be numerous and contributed approximately one half of total incremental leasing revenue added in the quarter. Our leasing backlog right now remains solid. Demand seems to be increasing, and we expect that the first quarter will be another strong one in terms of customer activity. Our services revenues were $18.7 million compared to $25.4 million in the year earlier period. This decline reflects in part a slowdown in activity from a principal customer in the fourth quarter that appears to be correcting itself now in 2012. Services segment operating profit was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Services segment operating profit margin was 12.4% compared to 12.8% in the year earlier period. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $15.8 million including non-cash compensation charges of $2.7 million. SG&A expenses were $15 million in the year earlier period, including non-cash compensation charges of $2.6 million. We are particularly pleased with our ability to grow our company materially, while holding SG&A expense relatively steady. Adjusted EBITDA was $117.3 million or a 14.1% increase over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin continued to grow and was 66.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 up from 62.7% in the year earlier period, a 350 basis point increase. Equity free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $70 million compared to $61.4 million in the year earlier period, an increase of 13.9%. Equity free cash flow per share for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $0.64 compared to $0.53 in the year earlier period, an increase of 20.8%. Our strong growth in equity free cash flow per share is a result of solid adjusted EBITDA growth combined with a declining share count. Beginning with our first quarter 2012 earnings release, we will begin providing funds from operations, or FFO, and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, metrics. We anticipate that AFFO will be calculated in a manner materially similar to our current calculation of equity free cash flow. Net loss attributable to SBA Communications Corporation during the fourth quarter was $29.1 million, compared to a net loss of $39.2 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the fourth quarter was $0.27, compared to $0.34 per share in the prior year period. Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 109.5 million, down from 114.9 million in the year earlier period, due to stock repurchase activity during 2011. Quarter end shares outstanding were 109.7 million. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 697 towers, built 83 towers, and decommissioned 18 towers for a net increase of 762 towers. We ended 2011 with 10,524 owned towers, an increase of nearly 16% versus the end of 2010. 9194 of the towers were in the US and its territories, and 1330 in international markets. Total cash, capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $200.2 million, consisting of $3.8 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx, and $196.4 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx for the fourth quarter includes $154.7 million, incurred in connection with tower acquisitions, exclusive of $8.1 million of working capital adjustment and paid earn outs, $19.3 million in tower construction, including construction in progress and $7.1 million for growth augmentations and tower upgrades. We have experienced an increase in the amount of augmentation CapEx over the prior year based largely on an increase in the number of sites we are touching, in order to accommodate the increased volume in customer contracts, as well as changes in state windmill wind loading codes [ph]. However, it is important to remember that the augmentation figure is a gross number and does not reflect approximately $4.1 million or 58% of cash reimbursements paid by our customers. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $8.7 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. At the end of 2011, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers. The average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is 33 years. At this point, I will turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thank you Brendan. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments of $75 million, resulting in net debt of $3.4 billion. Our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times, the same approximate level it has been for the last eight quarters. Our net secured debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.5 times. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was very strong at 2.8 times. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our debt had a weighted average annual cash coupon of 4.7% and a weighted average remaining maturity of 4.3 years. 86% of our total debt is fixed. As Jeff will discuss in a few moments, we plan to use available and committed debt financing to fund a portion of the Mobilitie transaction. While this will increase our second quarter leverage ratio slightly above our target range of 7 to 7.5 times, we are committed to and see a clear path to getting back into the range in the second half of this year. As part of the Mobilitie transaction, we carefully consider the impact on capital structure, and we structure the transaction to provide us with maximum flexibility going forward. As a result, we remain confident around future liquidity, future refinancing needs and having ample resources to continue to grow our business. In the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. We currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. Stock repurchases continue to be an important component within our overall capital allocation process to maximize shareholder value. However, it is likely that we will undertake little to no additional stock repurchases until we return to our target leverage range. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. As you have heard, we did have a great end to the year, exceeding or nearing the high end of our guidance across key financial metrics. Our organic leasing activity was strong and we expect this trend to continue through all of 2012. AT&T and Verizon stayed very active right through the end of the year, and represented almost half of our new business in the fourth quarter. We also saw a material uptick in activity from T-Mobile. Now we are seeing, in addition to continued demand from AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile material amounts of new activity from Spring through Network Vision. We continue to see strong demand across our entire portfolio, particularly as carriers continue to enhance and upgrade their networks to next generation technology to keep up with the strong secular demand for high speed wireless data. These views around strong organic growth, as well as portfolio growth are the reasons we were able to increase certain items in our full-year 2012 outlook. We believe we are in the early stages of 4G deployments in the US, and smart phone adoption in our international markets. In the last two weeks alone, several US carriers have disclosed higher spending plans around 4G. We expect to benefit from these factors for the next several years as carriers build out their initial coverage footprints to be followed by capacity spending as consumer adoption increases. With the shortage of spectrum in relation to the demand for wireless data service is well known, and the potential for a new public safety network in the US now greater than ever, we believe the demand for wireless infrastructure will be great for years to come. Given our expectations around future demand for wireless infrastructure, portfolio growth remains a top priority for SBA. We finished the year very strongly, adding in one quarter a material number of towers to our portfolio, most of which we added internationally. We continue to be very focused on the quality, price, future prospects and expected returns of the towers we add, and we are very pleased with our results in that regard. We are off to a strong start in 2012, even before the Mobilitie announcement, and obviously when that transaction closes, we will have greatly exceeded the high end of our 10% annual portfolio growth goal. Internationally, we are experiencing material growth. During the fourth quarter, we bought 584 towers, sold 57, and established new operations in Guatemala and Nicaragua. We now operate internationally in five countries in Central America, plus Canada. Pro forma for the Mobilitie transaction, and anticipated 2012 new builds, we will own over 1650 towers in central America, making us the pre-eminent tower company in the countries in which we operate in terms of resources and the number of towers we own. We are developing strong relationships with our customers in these markets, which include Telefonica, America Movil, and Digicel. In our international markets, just as in the US, lease up has been very strong, but we are very pleased with the results and customer acceptance of the co-location model in these markets. We expect to be presented with more opportunities for growth in these countries. We will also continue to review opportunities in additional countries for a potential fit to our business model. And now we will discuss our Mobilitie transaction, which we announced just this past Tuesday morning. We are very excited about the transaction for a number of reasons, including how complementary the Mobilitie assets are to our existing portfolio. Approximately 2090 of the sites are located throughout the US, and the remainder are located in Guatemala and Nicaragua, where we now have operations. We expect all of these towers to be integrated and absorbed into our company smoothly, and with only a modest increase in our SG&A expense. We expect an annual increase in SG&A expense of approximately $2 million to operate the Mobilitie assets, and less if we sell the vast [ph] assets. The towers themselves are all relatively new, with an average capacity of three or more tenants, with good ground space and terms. In the US, 67% of the Mobilitie towers are located within the top 50 BTAs, and 77% in the top 100. Reflecting their young age, the Mobilitie towers average 1.3 tenants per tower. Mostly these towers were originated when AT&T and Verizon, in particular were focused on technology overlays on their existing sites, and not on new site creation through cell splitting. Given all the recent news about future mobile data usage, spectrum shortages, increased capital spending on 4G, and now a new public safety network, we are very excited about the lease up potential of these assets. We are particularly excited about converting these assets into our lease up system, which has proven very successful over our history. The substantial majority of the US towers were built for T-Mobile with most of the remainder being built for Sprint. T-Mobile represents 66% of the US tower revenue, with approximately 91% of the existing US tower revenue coming from the big four nationwide providers. The anchor tenant relationships with the US Mobilitie towers are structured differently than our or the traditional anchor tenant relationships in the tower industry. In the Mobilitie case, the anchor tenant, which provided favorable equipment rights – (inaudible) and 50% revenue share on future co-location revenue. Excuse me, Brendan would you pick up.
Brendan Cavanagh: In exchange for that, those favorable equipment rights, and the 50% revenue share, the anchor tenant pays a market rental rate, which escalates to 3% per year, plus reimburses to the tower owner, all operating and capital expenses of the tower. In other words, a triple net lease in the traditional commercial real estate sense. Co-locations of additional tenants are handled in the traditional manner, and the same way as we process co-locations. The net economic results for the Mobilitie US towers is 100% tower cash flow margins, and no maintenance CapEx. Although the accounting result is different, as we will record the operating expenses as an expense, and then gross up the revenue by the reimbursable path through expenses. The Central American towers fall in the traditional tower model.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks Brendan. Sorry about that. Fighting an horrible cold here. While the Mobilitie US towers were originated under a different model, it is a model that we are comfortable with in terms of expected financial returns. This was not a strategic transaction for us, but a financial one. we are buying the assets at what we think is a very good price, in terms of both multiple and price per tower. Based on what we think are conservative lease up forecast, particularly around permanent tenants per tower, which for purposes of our valuation, we assumed would be below our portfolio average. We are targeting a double-digit five-year internal rate of return of 300 basis points to 500 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital, and that is after the impact of revenue sharing. With respect to organic same tower growth rates, we expect the Mobilitie towers with revenue share to growth at slightly less than our portfolio average, but only slightly less because of their lower starting base. As an example, a Mobilitie tower with 1.3 tenants today growing to 2.0 tenants over five years, or seven tenths of a tenant added would produce a compound tower cash flow growth rate to us of 8% after revenue share. And we will have opportunities to do a lot better given the location of these towers. The transaction will add materially to adjusted EBITDA and our equity free cash flow, substantially increasing our scale and financial capabilities, and be materially accretive to equity free cash flow per share. Most importantly, we believe our equity free cash flow per share will be materially higher five years from now than it otherwise would have been as a result of this transaction. All in all, we believe it to be a great financial transaction for us. Part of the attractiveness of the transaction for us was the cost and mix of financing. By using a combination of cash and stock, we are able to achieve a very accretive outcome – excuse me, to equity free cash flow per share, by only increasing net debt leverage modestly above our target range of 7.0 to 7.5 times. We will be committed to reducing leverage back to where we are today, and post closing, we expect leverage to drop to within our target range in the second half of 2012. The cash portion of the transaction will be funded from our fully available $500 million revolving credit facility, which will be expanded to $600 million as part of the transaction, plus a $400 million one year acquisition term loan secured by the Mobilitie assets. The revolver drawn will bear interest at one month LIBOR, plus approximately 237 basis points. Full availability will be created under the revolver without the need for inclusion of any of the Mobilitie assets. The acquisition term loan will bear interest at one month LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The combination of the two produces a blended interest rate on the financing of approximately 3.2% based on today’s LIBOR rates. Going forward, we will look to source replacement debt financing to reload a portion of our revolver, repay the acquisition term loan, and possibly fix some of the interest rates associated with this financing. The way we have structured the transaction provides us tremendous flexibility to move collateral around to maximize financing outcomes, and the markets are currently very robust around and desirous of this type of credit. Included in the transaction are various indoor and outdoor DAS assets in New York, Chicago, Las Vegas and Albom [ph] University. Pursuant to our terms of investment in ExteNet Systems, we are obligated to attempt to negotiate a sale of those assets to ExteNet for cash back to SBA. We have kept ExteNet generally apprised of our progress with Mobilitie, and we look forward to now seeing if we can strike and close a deal with ExteNet with respect to the DAS assets. If we can, we will likely keep and operate the DAS assets, or we may choose to sell them to someone else. If we kept the assets, we would not be looking to expand our DAS assets beyond these particular assets. We will continue to channel new DAS opportunities through our investment into ExteNet. We are very excited about the Mobilitie opportunity. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter, and as soon as it does we will be revising our outlook in our next earnings release to incorporate the transaction. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. Our employees work really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. Our employees do a great job, our customers recognize that, and as a result we are a preferred provider for our customers’ network needs. Our customers are and we think will remain extremely busy improving and expanding their wireless networks. We look forward to continued success as we move through 2012. And a special thanks to Brendan for stepping in in my moment of need. Operator, at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And our first question will come from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Go ahead please.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Thanks. Good morning guys. I think I will ask Brendan to save your voice there Jeff?
Jeffrey Stoops: Sorry about that. It was embarrassing.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Maybe just walk us through a sample math on the sharing agreement like just to use easy numbers, not to say as through actual rent, but just round numbers, if the anchor rent was $2000 a month, and the operating expense of the tower was what, 1000, just to use easy math, just kind of wanting to walk through the how it will be reflected into your income statement when that next tenant gets added?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, hi Ric. It is Brendan. So the way that it will work is that that base rent of $2000 in your example, plus the expenses, another $1000 will be recognized as revenue. You would have $3000 of revenue. You would have $1000, I’m sorry, you would have yes, $3000 of revenue. You gross up the expenses, if we incurred $1000 of expense, they would reimburse us for that. So we would have $3000 of expense – I’m sorry $3000 of revenue, and $1000 of expense. If we add a co-locator, depending on how that agreement is struck, it would result in us getting 50% of that revenue from the new co-locator, which we would recognize as revenue and there wouldn’t be any recognition of the other 50% that would-be paid. It would be netted against the payment that goes to the anchor.
Jeffrey Stoops: So, Ric, if that were another $2000 tenant, then we would be recording total revenue, including reimbursements of $4000, and $1000 of the expense. Thanks.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: I just want to make sure I understood, and built into low [ph]. Thanks for that. And then we understand that Mobilitie had also signed an MLA agreement with Sprint. Can you compare and contrast that for us to understand what their agreement might be like, knowing that American Tower had an MLA with Sprint that addressed all towers, even before they touch provision, whereas I think the other tower companies have done when that is more as you touch it. Can you just kind of help us understand what the mobility agreement is like?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, it is the same, basically as it is for T-Mobile. The anchor tenant gets revenue share and picks up all operating expense and maintenance CapEx expenses. So it is basically the same.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: And so, as Sprint goes through Vision, is there a change?
Jeffrey Stoops: They are going to have flexible equipment rights that will likely include most of the Network Vision just for Sprint, but it would not include any network sharing or other carriers, who might want a network share without equipment.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: And that is only with the anchor tenant?
Jeffrey Stoops: Right.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Not with…
Jeffrey Stoops: That is about 300 of the sites.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Okay, great. And then, I think you mentioned T-Mobile has been active, but it seems like they were just kind of pulling together their view of what they wanted to do even into mid-February with what they announced yesterday. Do you think the activity pick up you are seeing from T-Mobile is reflective of this new go out and build out to years, is it just because they were getting busy because the T-Mobile or the AT&T deal had collapsed?
Jeffrey Stoops: No, it was the latter. Most of the pickup in activity that I was speaking to was the roaming number [ph] build. It had nothing to do with the announcement yesterday.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Right. That makes sense. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: We will go next to Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.
Philip Cusick - JP Morgan: Hi guys. Just a follow up as usual on Ric, what do you anticipate is built in here for sort of Clearwire and T-Mobile for this year, is there anything of that within guidance?
Jeffrey Stoops: Not on the new T-Mobile announcement, and not really anything for Clearwire. Maybe we had some team [ph] that we expected roaming over build and the activity that we would expect that they would have undertaken, but this was prior to the 4G announcement.
Philip Cusick - JP Morgan: Okay. And given the higher leverage now, do you anticipate that you still have the ability to compete if T-Mobile decides to sell towers later in the year, or do you feel like you are out of that?
Jeffrey Stoops: No, any deal like that would have required us to use a mix of cash and equity. So I don’t think that we are out of it. Obviously we are going to be working on in reducing the leverage from this transaction down, which we expect to do very quickly. But because any deal like that would have required a mix of equity for us, you know, I would say no, we will take a look as we do with all transactions.
Philip Cusick - JP Morgan: Got it. And barring that, you said you will get back down into the 7.5 or below range by the second half, can you anticipate sort of getting back into a buying stock scenario this year or is that really a 13 event?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, it will depend on what we see in the market. And whether we see portfolio growth opportunities that we like better than stock repurchase opportunities. Last year we favored more than we had previously stock repurchase, which I think was also a reflection of what we saw in the acquisition market. So it really depends. I mean obviously this year we have got some big portfolio growth acquisition plans ahead of us. But we are committed to continue to be opportunistic stock repurchasers, but we always compare that to what is out there in terms of portfolio growth opportunities, which remains our primary focus for use of capital.
Philip Cusick - JP Morgan: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense on the Mobilitie side as to what portion of the cash flows that you highlighted in the release come from the DAS relative to the towers, business, so for trying to separate those two businesses over the longer term. And then in terms of your investments into new tower builds, could you just give us a sense where you know, you would like to deploy most of that capital in the US or internationally, and then what the longer term goals are for international revenue as a total contribution? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, the split between the tower cash flow and the DAS cash flow in the Mobilitie transaction is approximately 16 million of expected 2012, and 59 million on the tower side for expected 2012. In terms of our international mix and our desires for new builds, we are doing a lot of early stage high-growth assets internationally, which we think will continue to grow and drive growth for our overall company materially as we move forward. So we will continue to focus. We will build more towers outside United States again this year than we will build in the United States. And in terms of our revenue contribution, you know, we will grow in 2012, we will end the year we are confident at a higher absolute number. In terms of the pro forma affective Mobilitie that may cause International to not growth as much on a percentage basis, but will clearly grow materially on absolute dollars, and we will still look to get to that 10% level in the next several years.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: If I can ask one more question about ExteNet, you know, I don’t know if I have ever seen you guys break out what your ownership percentage is there, and I was just wondering if you could give us any incremental color on what your longer term considerations are around your investment?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, we own a sizeable minority interest in ExteNet, and our long-term internet is to continue to support them and should ExteNet decide that they want to monetize or move on or sell the business, we are I think well positioned to take a look, and we will be very interested if that opportunity comes along.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: Thank you so much for taking the questions.
Operator: We will go next to David Barden – Bank of America.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks guys for taking the questions. Just first, maybe Jeff on the – your view of valuation as you looked at the Mobilitie asset, I think a lot of us have been trying to figure out based on what you know, Crown Castle was paying for DAS businesses, how you guys are looking at the split of valuation between the two different streams that you saw coming out of Mobilitie that will be kind of question number one. And I guess just kind of question number two, as you kind of look at the game plan for the public safety network, and kind of what the chatter is out there, you know, what is an insider’s view of how you think this thing is going to potentially unfold. Are they going to really try to leverage the existing network infrastructure, or do you see them kind of trying to carve out separate network infrastructure for themselves? I would love from insight from you on that, great?
Jeffrey Stoops: Let me start with the last first, Dave. On the public – I mean, there will be the idealists who will want a stand-alone network that is free of external touches so to speak. They don’t want to fill people around that equipment. I think that is an idealistic view. I think the economic realities may very well force a network sharing type of situation, and perhaps the truth is somewhere in between. But I think it is going to be economically impossible to have the ideal operational goal of the public safety world, which would be actually not only low rent centers, but you know, your own towers. I just don’t think that is going to happen. So I think the ideals will have to meet the economic reality somewhere in between.
Brendan Cavanagh: In terms of the DAS business, we bought basically 4 locations. They are kind of discrete assets without any backlog or better future growth of new – it wasn’t an ongoing business so to speak, the way (inaudible). But they are good assets, and we think you know there will be, I don’t really want to get into the splits, because we have to negotiate price with ExteNet. So pardon me for ducking on that one, but they are good assets, and we think ExteNet is going to be very interested.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got you. Thanks for the color.
Operator: We have a question now from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. Good morning. I wonder if you could touch on the T-Mobile leases with the Mobilitie acquisition. I think you said before your T-Mobile leases have an average of a three-year life. Is there any material difference with these leases? And then I guess as part of the recent payroll tax legislation, there was some tower legislation included in there easing the sort of co-location process, I wonder if you could just talk about some of the opportunities that presents? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, the new T-Mobile leases average about seven years on the Mobilitie assets. And in terms – your second question?
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Yes, there was – I think you…
Jeffrey Stoops: On the co-location by legislation, yes, that is going to help in certain assets. I mean that legislation will really, it is really geographic specific because in most places where we do business, and I think this is true for the whole tower industry, you really did not have a lot of trouble getting additional co-los on, but there were definitely some jurisdictions, Southern California and some other parts of the country where it was a problem. So in those areas where you did have those issues, that legislation will definitely be impactful. I don’t think for the industry as a whole it will materially change things, but it is certainly an incremental positive.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups, first on the guidance hike, just thinking through the mechanics, I guess your answer to Phil’s question earlier sort of indicates Clearwire and T-Mo won’t really drivers on the fundamental side. Should we interpret that the hike is predominantly new towers you have added into the mix, and anything fundamental, the improvements you have seen in the last few months wasn’t necessarily layered in. And then second question just back to Mobilitie, you talked through obviously the different anchor tenant structure, I am just wondering do you have a path to potentially tweak the relationship, path or desire to change that relationship with the anchor tenant to really synch it up with how your traditional tower arrangements work? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Brendan, do you want to take the first one?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. We – I am sorry. First question was…
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs: On the guidance hike, and the mechanics…
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, most of the guidance hike was based on portfolio growth. There was a small increase associated with what we are seeing in our organic growth profile.
Jeffrey Stoops: It really Jason, did not take into account yesterday’s announcements from T-Mo or Clearwire.
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Brendan Cavanagh: And on the Mobilitie, always, we are very attracted to the group of assets because of the ability to potentially tweak relationships and restructure things going forward. So we do think there is a variety of interesting opportunities that are going to be considered, and help us too in that respect.
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.
James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I can quickly, one of the DAS assets, you said they were only four of them, so maybe this is not a relevant question, but is the mix materially different in terms of the customer base from the tower of Mobilitie assets, and secondly, on T-Mobile I know it is early, and they just made the announcement, but can you help us think through ways what they are announcing in terms of what they are doing with LTE, signals, antenna and the like would be meaningfully different from the upgrade pack you have seen Verizon and AT&T take. Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, on the DAS assets James, it is not materially different in terms of the customer mix. And in terms of the upgrade, you know, T-Mobile will most – we don’t know all the details yet, but I would guess it is going to be similar given the same types of technology migration path that AT&T has done, which means there will be some amendments and some new equipment needed, and certainly the amendment possibility. So it is very favorable development I think for our company and the industry in general. But I specifically would say AT&T because of the similarities of the technology migration path.
James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital: Great. Thanks.
Operator: We will go next to Suhail Chandy with Wedbush.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter and Mobilitie. First a house-keeping question, trying to understand what is underlying guidance, could you possibly give us a split on the discretionary CapEx between new builds and tower upgrades for 2012?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. While the discretionary CapEx for the acquisition sites are all detailed in the press release. So it is only based on what we have under contract as of today. And then on our new builds, we’re estimating that we’re going to build a little over 400 sites during 2012. Most of those are international. So the average cost is somewhere a little less than 200,000. So if that gives you an idea.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Great, thanks. And the organic revenue growth assumption that you have built in that is underlying, is it more like 8%, or higher?
Brendan Cavanagh: 8% to 9%. 9% is still where we are.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Great. And two final questions if I may, on the Mobilitie portfolio, what is the percent of towers that have any anchor tenant. And I think T-Mobile was too good, I may have missed it, but…
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, those are 100% anchored.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: 100% anchored.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, they are all anchored tenants. Most of them are T-Mobile, about 1700 are T-Mobile and the remainder in the US would-be Sprint.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Great, thanks. That is very helpful, and my final question, regarding the legislation that is possibly going to get passed with favorable co-location, does it touch all types of equipment, so you know, everything that is in the shelter basically, or can it also potentially address shared generators, and any other changes to the site configuration?
Jeffrey Stoops: No, I think it was more co-location by – I don’t think it extends to equipment on the ground. I don’t believe that they would legislate that. I don’t believe it covers anything other than the antennas on the tower. But I don’t think they really needed to go beyond that either. I don’t really know of any issues where people are having trouble getting generators in place, or anything else, other than the antennas on towers that are already previously built and approved.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Thanks. That is pretty helpful.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Next we have Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
Michael Rollins – Citi Investment Research: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You know, I guess, more of a philosophical question on how you are looking at acquisition these days. I know you have the Mobilitie transaction. You mentioned about some of the constraints in the industry, and you know we only a few months ago were talking about the possibility of AT&T and T-Mo getting together, and what that would mean for you guys. And if the industry not in its final resting place in terms of structure, how do you look at picking up tenant exposure that could be involved in the next level of consolidation, how do you weigh that versus some of the financial metrics of the transaction. You know, maybe you could talk about both, with respect to how you look at the Mobilitie transaction and how you might look at future deals going forward? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes. That is a great question Mike, and to be honest with you we were not really pursuing the Mobilitie assets, while the T-Mobile AT&T transaction was pending. We really did not develop our interest in those assets until it was clear that that transaction would be not passed through, and then based on all the color around the US desire and perceived demands that they are going to be four nationwide carriers for some period of time. So we do take all those issues into careful consideration, and really our interest in Mobilitie was generated upon the termination of the AT&T, T-Mobile transaction.
Michael Rollins – Citi Investment Research: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Go ahead please.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Securities: Yes. You funded the Mobilitie transaction with very attractive, low-cost debt. We have seen a number of your competitors also raise money at very, very attractive interest rates of 3% to 4% on a secured basis, 5% or so, and unsecured. Are you concerned at all that this low cost of capital is going to drive up transaction multiples for the industry, and we’re going to get into some significant betting wars for future assets, just given how cheap capital is right now?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well. You know, I hope that doesn’t happen Kevin. I mean history in the real estate business, there are direct correlations between prices for assets and cost of financing. And I don’t know if our future will be any different than the traditional commercial real estate past in that regard. I mean clearly when you are looking to generate material growth in equity free cash flow per share, cost of financing matters. And then that translates into what you are willing to pay to achieve the desired growth in equity free cash flow per share. So does it have an impact? Sure. Absolutely. You know, well, will it cause people to not be disciplined? You know, it is not going to cause us to not be disciplined, and I think our peers are pretty good in that respect as well.
Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Securities: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And gentlemen, we have no further questions. Please go ahead with any closing remarks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, thank you everyone, and I apologize for losing my voice midstream, but Brendan picked up well, and we look forward to reporting our next results, which in all likelihood may include the Mobilitie transaction closing and the changes in guidance that could result from that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, and ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and choosing AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark DeRussy, Director of Finance. Please go ahead. Mark DeRussy Good morning and thank you for joining us today for SBA’s third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking including but not limited to any guidance for 2011 and 2012 beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business, everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night’s press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we may make. Our statements are as of today November 1, 2011, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. Our comments today will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website www.sbasite.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Brendan to comment on our third quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, our third quarter financial and operational results were very strong. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance for site leasing revenues, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and equity free cash flow. Total revenues were a $175.5 million, up 10.7% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the third quarter were a $154.5 million or a 13.9% increase over the third quarter of 2010. Our site leasing revenue growth was driven by both organic and portfolio growth. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue comes from the U.S. and its territories with approximately 3.7% of total leasing revenue coming from international operations. Site leasing segmenting operating profit was $120.6 million or an increase of 14.4% over the third quarter of 2010. Site leasing contributed 97.5% of our total segment operating profit. Tower cash flow for the third quarter of 2011 was a $121.6 million or a 14.2% increase over the year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 79.8% compared to 79.4% in the year earlier period. Operationally, we are experiencing strong leasing demand both domestically and internationally amendments which were predominantly from AT&T and Verizon continue to be numerous and contributed over one half of total incremental leasing revenue added in the quarter. Our leasing backlog right now remains solid and we expect that the fourth quarter will be another strong one in terms of customer activity. Our services revenues were $21 million compared to $23 million n the year earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $3.1 million in the third quarter compared to $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2010. Services segment operating profit margin was 14.8% compared to 11.7% in the year earlier period, a 310 basis point improvement as a result of better execution and a mix shift towards higher margin business. SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $15.4 million including non-cash compensation charges of $2.7 million. SG&A expenses were $14.4 million in the year earlier period, including non-cash compensation chargers of $2.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $112.5 million or a 15.1% increase over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin continued to grow and was 64.9% in the third quarter of 2011 up from 62.2% in the year earlier period, a 270 basis point increase. Equity free cash flow for the third quarter of 2011 was $63.9 million compared to $56.8 million in the year earlier period, an increase of 12.7%. Equity free cash flow per share for the third quarter of 2011 was $0.58 compared to $0.49 in the year earlier period, an increase of 18.4%. Our strong growth in equity free cash flow per share is a result of solid adjusted EBITDA growth combined with a declining share count. Net loss attributable to SBA Communications Corporation during the third quarter was $33.3 million, compared to a net loss of $34.5 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the third quarter was $0.30. The same as the net loss per share in the year earlier period. Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 110.2 million, down from 114.7 million in the year earlier period. Due to stock repurchase activity, quarter end shares outstanding were down to 109.4 million. In the third quarter, we acquired 82 towers and built 119 towers ending the quarter with 9762 towers owned and the right to manage approximately 4900 additional communication sites. As of September 30, we owned 9071 towers in the US and its territories, and 691 in international markets. Total cash, capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2011 were $84.3 million, consisting of $4.4 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $79.9 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Non-discretionary CapEx included about $0.5 million of storm related damage above estimated insurance recoveries from Hurricane Irene, tornadoes, floods and mud slides, that impacted a number of our markets in the second and third quarters. Discretionary cash CapEx for the third quarter includes $42.2 million, incurred in connection with acquisitions, exclusive of $4.1 million of working capital adjustment. It also includes $32.5 million in new tower construction including construction in progress and $4 million for growth augmentations and tower upgrades. The augmentation figure is a gross number and does not reflect approximately $2.6 million or 65% to cash reimbursements paid by our customers. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $8.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always immediately accretive. As of September 30 2011, approximately 71% of our tower sites were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years. The average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is 32 years. At this point, I’m going to turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and our balance sheet.
Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brandon. SBA ended the third quarter with $3.5 billion at total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments totaling $209 million resulting in a net debt of $3.3 billion. Our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times, the same approximate level it has been for the last eight quarters. Our net secured debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.4 times. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a very strong 2.7 times. As of the end of the quarter, our debt had a weighted average annual cash coupon of 4.7% and a weighted average remaining maturity of 4.5 years. 86% of our total debt was fixed rate. We believe our balance sheet is in very good shape, as we have no material debt maturities prior to 2013 and we believe we have ample liquidity to meet our business plans and growth objectives. At the end of the quarter, our $500 million revolver was undrawn and fully available to us. This combined with our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term restricted cash of $209 million, gave us total and immediately available liquidity of approximately $709 million. Including anticipated equity free cash flow over the next 12 months, we will have approximately $1 billion of liquidity. In the third quarter we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $75 million at an average price of $34.42. We currently have $150 million remaining under our existing $300 million authorization. Stock repurchases continue to be an important component within our overall capital allocation process to maximize shareholder value. We continue to view them as a tool we utilize opportunistically rather than systematically. As of September 30 2011, we had cumulatively repurchased 9.1 million as we began our open market purchase activities in late 2009 representing approximately 8% of our outstanding shares. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. As you have heard, we did have a great quarter exceeding our guidance midpoints across key financial metrics. Our organic leasing activity was strong and we expect this trend to continue through the remainder of 2011 and into 2012. We continue to see strong demand across our entire portfolio, particularly as carriers continue to enhance and upgrade their networks to next generation technology to keep up with the strong secular demand for high speed wireless data. We believe we are in the early stages of 4G deployments and expect to benefit from this technological upgrade for the next several years as carriers build out their initial coverage footprints to be followed by capacity spending as consumer adoption increases. In the third quarter we had our most active quarter with respect to executed lease amendments in the company’s history. AT&T and Verizon continue to be very busy and represented well over half of our new business in the quarter. Most of the domestic leasing activity in the last couple of years and we believe for the next couple of years has centered around customer overlays and upgrades to existing antenna sites as opposed to deployments of new antenna sites. SBA has been a great beneficiary of this trend due to our large embedded base of AT&T and Verizon tenancies and we expect our position will only be enhanced as Sprint begins a similar type of existing network upgrade with their Network Vision projects. Primarily as a result of anticipated continued strong demand from AT&T and Verizon a material new demand from Sprint, we are guiding to strong organic domestic leasing growth in 2012. Portfolio growth remains a primary focus for SBA. With respect to acquisitions and new tower builds, we continue to see a number of opportunities both domestically and internationally. We are staying disciplined and pursuing only those opportunities that we believe will meet or exceed our internal rate of return targets and passing on those that do not. As you can see from the number of towers under agreement to acquire as disclosed in last night’s press release, we expect a strong finish to 2011 and a solid start to 2012. We expect to finish 2011 with over 10,000 towers owned, exceeding the high end of our target range for our portfolio growth of 5% to 10%. We are once again targeting 5% to 10% portfolio growth in 2012. Our international business continues to see strong growth. International tower count grew almost 700 at the end of Q3 and revenues were 3.7% of our total leasing revenues. During the quarter, we bought 16 towers and built 89 internationally. The substantial majority of the 704 towers we disclosed is under our agreement to acquire are in Central America and have new build characteristics and that we are buying them at essentially replace the cost and they start with one tenant. In our international markets, follow-on lease up has been very strong and we are very pleased with the operating processes and overall metrics in these markets. We have successfully developed US tower company style businesses in these markets. We intend to continue to expand in these countries and also continue to review opportunities in additional countries where we see a potential fit for our business model. Overall, we expect to continue to grow our business internationally, but also continue to do so with a measured and careful approach. We anticipate materially increasing our international site leasing revenue as a percentage of total site leasing revenue in 2012, but still marching at our goal of 10% that likely won’t be attained until 2013 or perhaps 2014. We had another quarter of material stock repurchase activity. We evaluate and execute stock repurchases opportunistically based on the absolute price of our stock and relative to acquisition opportunities. While portfolio growth continues to be our priority, as long as the market continues to undervalue our stock, we expect to take advantage of the opportunities and repurchase our shares. Based on the midpoint of our fourth quarter 2011 tower cash flow guidance, we have repurchased our stock this year at an average 15.0 times tower cash flow multiple. We believe the price at which we have repurchased our stock is well below intrinsic value. With respect to our negotiations with Sprint covering Network Vision potential item migration, network sharing and other topics, I am pleased to say we have concluded negotiations and recently signed a comprehensive agreement covering such topics. I want to spend the rest of my prepared remarks on our 2012 guidance. As our initial guidance indicates, we expect the current strength in our business to continue into 2012. With respect to organic site leasing revenue growth, we expect to repeat materially the same level of incremental organic carrier activity on a revenue added per tower basis in 2012, as we have seen year-to-date in 2011. In addition to that, we expect to see activity related to Sprint’s Network Vision project in 2012 that would be additive to our 2000 levels of activity. As a result, we believe that we will be able to maintain our organic cash leasing revenue growth expectation of 9% implying that the absolute incremental amount of our organic cash leasing revenue added per tower will also be up 9% from 2011 levels, inclusive of the escalators and without any regard to any non-cash straight-line benefits. Our 2012 outlook includes benefits from the Sprint agreement to both cash and non-cash site leasing revenues. Total non-cash site leasing revenue and our 2012 outlook is approximately $30 million of which approximately $20 million is attributable to the Sprint agreement. For those of you doing margin analysis, keep in mind that our definitions of tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA exclude non-cash items. So you need to subtract non-cash items from site leasing revenues to calculate margin. When you do, you will see that we are expecting another strong year of margin performance in 2012. The portion of our guidance that relates to Sprint comes only from expected Network Vision upgrades and not from any network sharing that Sprint might undertake. Network sharing by Sprint which is covered by our agreement would be additive. Our tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2012 includes approximately $4 million of cash basis site leasing revenue from Sprint Network Vision. The accuracy of our guidance around the Sprint incremental portion of 2012 site leasing cash revenue growth will depend entirely on the speed with which Sprint hits our sites for Network Vision upgrades in 2012. And while we talked much about Sprint, when you analyze our 2012 organic cash leasing revenue outlook, you will see we expect continued strong contributions from AT&T and Verizon. In our site leasing revenue outlook we expect no material surprises from churn to our 2012 results as we have already factored in a churn allowance in the guidance which allowance is similar to those churn levels we have experienced the last couple of years. On the services revenue side, the guided increase to the 2012 midpoint of expected full year 2011 results is entirely due to expected work from the Network Vision project. With respect to net cash interest expense, we are assuming three months LIBOR remains at or below 1.0% throughout 2012. As is our custom, our outlook includes only those towers we own and tend to build or have under agreement to acquire as of today, and we do not guide any stock repurchases. As a result, we are today including on our in our initial 2012 guidance a level of discretionary capital list well below 2011 levels. It will be our goal to invest additional material amounts of capital in portfolio growth, stock repurchases or both. As Mark mentioned earlier, we have significant liquidity that could be deployed for asset growth and/or stock repurchases which could improve our outlook over the course of 2012. If we were to extrapolate our fourth quarter 2012 EBITDA from our full year guidance, and we chose to maintain our current net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage levels, we could invest approximately an additional $500 million and more if the investment goes into portfolio growth. Before we open it up for questions, I want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. Our employees work really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. Our employees do a great job, our customers recognize that and as a result we are a preferred provider for our customer’s network needs. Our customers are and we think will remain extremely busy improving and expanding their wireless networks. We look forward to continued success as we finish this year, and as we move into 2012. And Nick, at this time, we’d like to open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: Yes, good morning. On the Sprint MOA, I’m interested, does that contemplate just the CDMA and LTE related work or does it also include the impact of taking down iDEN equipment in the medium to longer term?
Brendan Cavanagh: Hey, Jonathan it’s Brendan. It covers a few things. One of those things is the iDEN termination we’ve given Sprint certain negotiated termination rates associated with the iDEN decommissioning and it’s important I think to point out in our revenue guidance in calculation of the potential impact on straight line that we have assumed in our calculation sort of the worst case in terms of timing and amount associated with the iDEN terminations and just since we are on the subject a couple of the other things that are covered by the Sprint agreement are extensions the length of the minimum lease term associated with the existing lease agreements that obviously contributed to the straight line component of our guidance, as well as a minimum payment obligation that Sprint would have in connection with the Network Vision equipment adds or up replacements really where they will be paying us as they make those installations but even if they don’t there is a date certain by which they would ultimately have to pay either way. Those are the main components of the Sprint arrangement.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: And is the minimal obligation then straight lined or do you recognize that always as incurred?
Brendan Cavanagh: No, it’s straight lined.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: Okay.
Brendan Cavanagh: It would be adjusted though to the extent that they actually install on our sites earlier than that minimum obligation date there would be an impact where the cash revenue would start perhaps a little bit earlier then it’s assumed for purposes of the straight line calculation.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: Understand. And on 2012 the 400 tower builds what would be the approximate split between US and international?
Jeff Stoops: It would be approximately 120 US and the rest international.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: And then can you remind us or tell us what the employee headcount is and then how might that change next year as you ramp international?
Jeff Stoops: Think we have about 850 employees today and I – we might add 10 folks, but I don’t see us materially increasing headcount or SG&A above what is already excluded in our outlook Jonathan.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: And then finally, can you repeat the non-cash revenue the $30 million then how much of that is attributable to Sprint for 2012 and then what the non-cash contribution is for 2011, so we can think about margins?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah it’s $20 million for ’012, it’s $20 million from Sprint, as well as $30 million roughly in total for ‘012 and in 2011, the total number implied in our full year ’11 guidance is around $11 million. That includes just for clarification about $3 million from Sprint in Q4.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then the revenue – you guys said 65% cash reimbursement for augmentation CapEx that flows through site leasing revenues I believe and over what period is that straight lined?
Brendan Cavanagh: It spread out over the term of the lease agreement that is signed up in connection with. So, typically those leases are five years if it’s an amendment, it might be over a slightly lesser period of time.
Jeff Stoops: The remaining current term.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: Right, understand. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Thanks good morning guys.
Jeff Stoops: Hey Ric.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Hey, couple questions for you if I could. Jeff you mentioned that the Sprint contribution was $4 million on a cash basis it would depend on the timing. Have you noticed the acceleration of Sprint applications to you as you negotiated and then signed the agreement?
Jeff Stoops: Actually, that’s all just stated for us now, because all along our contemplated arrangement with Sprint would not only be the leasing side of the work, but also the services. So, until we kind of reach the overall agreement there wasn’t a lot, but now we expect things to open up there materially. And because of that reason there is really no incremental cash benefit assumed in our fourth quarter outlook from Sprint. It all starts in 2012.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Okay, that makes sense. And you mentioned no unusual churn expected or no material surprise of churn expected in 2012, what is your typical churn level these days on a percent of revenue?
Jeff Stoops: About 1.5% and we’ve had two years now of a portion of that coming from Verizon, Altel. We actually are pretty confident we are well through the lion share of that. There will be some of that in ‘012 but that’s in our numbers.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: And then on the international side, do any of your transactions down there anticipate pass-through?
Jeff Stoops: Yes, they do. They do. And it’s not all and it’s kind of case-by-case, but there will be some pass-throughs of ground rents in some cases.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Okay and as American Tower today started reporting AFFO and FFO Crown on their call said they would look to consider reporting AFFO, have you guys given any thought of the industry coming together and creating an AFFO standard that everybody would report?
Jeff Stoops: Well, that would certainly be the goal and I think we are going to study American’s definition which I think was first rolled out kind of now and like to see what Crown does and we’ll do the same thing. But I hope when I say the same thing it’s truly is the same thing.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: And need to Always helps when people report the same kind of basis and nice to get all the straight line adjustments finally out there for everybody too. Great, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go now to the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I’d like to actually go a little bit deeper on to the MOA with Sprint. Last year, you guys have kind of quantified your exposure to iDEN I think you had 8% to 9% about a year ago, maybe you can give us an update there. Also historically, you guys have stayed away from these MOA type agreements and maybe you can give us some color as to why this one was an important one or more advantageous one to go ahead pursue and then ultimately sign? And then finally, as we think about lease renewals in general, what we’ve heard from both Crown and American is that maybe over the last few years, lease renewals have been a little bit more aggressive, considering you haven’t entered into those MOAs, maybe you can give us some context for thinking about what your kind of lease renewal roll schedule looks like? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, we continue to renew 00% or better of our leases as they come due. So we continue to, we really haven’t seen any change in that at all Jonathan. On the view about the comprehensive agreement we’ve said this now several times, that really the only reason that we have entered into this agreement is because it was the only way to kind of deal with so many different moving parts and in fact some of which were desperate concepts but all came together to be viewed as one kind of relationship with our customer. So it should not be viewed as signaling any change in our long-term view, but really the only practical way to deal with this many different issues with this one particular customer. And in terms of our remaining Nextel exposure, it drops every quarter. I think it’s 6 to 7-ish percent now and not all of that will be lost over time.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: Great. Thank you for taking the questions.
Operator: We’ll go now to the line of David Barden with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch .
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hey guys thanks for taking the question. Sorry if you guys have touched on this a little bit, but just going back to the 704 towers that you guys have an agreement in principal, number one, those towers are in the next year’s guidance, understand but number two, could you kind of elaborate when the cash goes out the door, is it in the fourth quarter discretionary CapEx which will tie or is it in next year’s discretionary cash which is low as you explained? And then kind of where those towers are precisely again? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, most of them, the substantial majority of the 704 are in Central America. The rest would be in the United States and the cash expenditure we’ve kind of spread between Q4 and Q1 of 2012.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Q4 of ’11 and Q1 of ‘12.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes, yes.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Gotcha. Sorry Jeff, but any more specific numbers on the cash out the door Q4 and Q1 and the number of towers in the US versus Latin America?
Jeff Stoops: No I think, I think you can analyze the cash out the door pretty well by looking at our Q4 CapEx guidance.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, perfect and then just a second and apologize to broach the subject, but we are coming up potentially in a month Clearwire has an interest payment coming up and there has been a lot of debate in the industry about what the significance of that interest payment is and kind of what Clearwire has been working on as its potential options for dealing with that. Just as a representative tower company I know that there has been a very robust history between the tower companies and companies that have struggled in the wireless business, but are you making any particular preparations of doing anything special with respect to that company? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: The answer is no. We are not doing anything of particular other than monitoring the situation carefully and we know what are all the options are and you can rest assured we’ll be kind of reviewing what SBA’s response might be in light of all those options. But are we doing anything in particularly different? No.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: And could you remind us kind of the history of your experience with these sort of the situations in the past?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah in every case where a company has chosen to reorganize through a chapter 11 process they have renewed senses without exception, every one of their leases with us, because that is the business they are reorganizing around. In those cases where the business was liquidated which goes back to the 2001 and 2002 period, Chapter 7 you would lose those leases. But in every case, where the business was reorganized around a debt restructure all the leases were renewed.
David Barden – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Perfect, all right. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Clay Moran with Benchmark Capital.
Clay Moran – Benchmark Capital: Hey good morning. I wanted to get back to the 704 towers. Just wondering if this is multiple deals or was that one seller? And just wanted to make sure that when you say Central America it’s in your previously announced markets of Costa Rica and Panama. In addition, is it all cash deal? And then lastly, does this carry sizable cash payment meaning that you might slow down your near term stock repurchases?
Jeff Stoops: It is all cash. It is multiple transactions. We will be entering Guatemala as a result of these transactions in addition to adding towers in the rest of our already existing markets of Panama, Costa Rica and El Salvador. And we’ll have to stay tuned on the stock repurchase side Clay as we’ve try to point out we have ample liquidity and if we decide to stay capitalized on a debt-to-EBITDA basis the way we have today, we have a lot of additional investment capabilities that could go towards stock repurchases or portfolio growth are in our likelihood both.
Clay Moran – Benchmark Capital: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs: Hey thanks good morning. Maybe couple questions. First on to the margin trajectory in the 2012, Jeff I think you appropriately mentioned, when you peel out the $20 million on the non-cash revenue side, the implied margins are better than they otherwise would have been. But, then if you look at it and peel that out, it’s still sort of flat incremental margins in 2012. I’m just wondering when you would expect to see margin expansion on sort of an incremental basis and then secondly that the land deals that we’ve seen some of your peers doing this past quarter involved buying land to swap with others involve buying land under carrier towers with an eye towards maybe that forces the carrier to sell over time. Is that an opportunity that you think might be interesting as well? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: On the margins, Jason, it’s not just spread these you have to peel out the whole $30 million to appropriately calculate the margin and I would add two comments to your view we have a larger contribution expected in 2012 from services which is a lower margin business. And we also have a bunch of relatively new built type towers that we are adding to the portfolio. I’m not sure whether you are focused on the tower cash flow margin or the adjusted EBITDA margin. The adjusted EBITDA margin, I think somewhat grow and it’s our cash flow margin should grow some perhaps not as much as the adjusted EBITDA margin. On the land deals, we look at those things and I guess for a price we would find land under other folks’ tower attractive. We have simply just not made that decision to go that route when we would, because we would land under other folks’ towers we have to kind of view really along the same lines as additional portfolio growth or stock repurchases and we’ve simply seen in our particular case better opportunities with the latter.
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Next we go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much. Good morning. MetroPCS was just talking earlier this morning about moving to sell splitting to deal with the data demands from their customers and I think there has been a general expectation that the industry would start to move away from adding to existing sites and moving more into a cell splitting type model. I was wondering if you could comment on what you’ve been seeing in the last few months and what do you expecting as you move into 2012? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: Well, Metro is a little unique or at least different than, say AT&T or Verizon as they are moving forward. In AT&T and Verizon’s case, it is new spectrum is being deployed as on overlay. So it’s entirely amendment driven until they get this done. Metro is of course deploying LTE in the same spectrum. So it maximize that spectrum it works through cell split. So that’s all very logical, Simon and does it necessarily reflect industry-wide trends as much as I do believe it reflects Metro’s specific issues but having said all that, we have seen some business from metro and we expect to see some more in 2012.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: And when do you think the big carriers will start to think about, they’ve talked about spectrum shortages out of couple of years and when do you think they’ve structured look to increase their cell cuts more dramatically?
Jeff Stoops: Well, it’s happening a little bit now. But I think you have to – if history is a guide and I think it will be here. You will need to see them get through substantially all of their technology upgrades, so that they can accurately and correctly say that they are offering these services nation-wide and then you begin the cell-split.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Suhail Chandy with Wedbush Securities.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Thank you for taking the question. Can I go back to the Sprint agreement? I realize you said that you kind of have the worst case assumptions, can you remind us how would this potentially change the timing of iDEN decommissioning? I think it was originally in, perhaps 2013 to 2017 come to the current assumptions assume maybe an earlier start to that?
Jeff Stoops: No, that’s the time period in which we have assumed for purposes of calculating the straight line impact.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Okay, great. Two large, big picture questions, do you think anecdotal evidence of private valuations of power companies versus public valuations have a slight disconnect. Do you expect that valuation disconnect to start contracting a bit sometime in 2012 and the second question on land parcels under your sites, have you done any kind of analysis on the ownership concentration of those ownership of the land parcels under your sites?
Jeff Stoops: On the price disconnect, I do think the prices will begin to converge and I do expect to see that more in 2012. They haven’t done that quite as much in ‘011 which is one of the reasons why we’ve allocated more capital on a proportionate basis than historically to stock repurchases. And on the land, we have done an analysis, we have literally above a half a percent of land under our towers that is out in the hands of third parties to the best of our knowledge and that is amongst a bunch of desperate owners. So we feel like we are in excellent shape in that regard and as you can tell from our results, we keep working the land side of our business every quarter.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Okay, great, thanks and congrats on the quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.
James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, two if I could. First of all, to what degree is any possible outcome of AT&T, T-Mobile incorporating in 2012 results either from accelerated activity in the event that the deal happens or divestitures et cetera and secondly if you look at the Clearwire base you have in the event of some sort of event where the – how would you consider the leases and the terms of those leases, versus your overall portfolio? Are they meaningfully different in terms of pricing or term or the like? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the latter first James, I don’t think they are any different, they are in the standard fiver year renewal option. So we are in the midst of all the rollovers there. So there would be a typical average remaining life and I would just want to remind folks that Clearwire has been a great customer. We wish them all the success and we are going to help them get there. But they are about 1% of our site leasing revenue. Your other question, I’m sorry?
James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital: AT&T and T-Mobile to what degree that is – or event in the 2012 guidance, one way or the other?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, we don’t have a specific divestiture model that has been run through there. We think by the time, the deal would be completed you would be the middle of the year and you’d have in fact very little if any impact on 2012 results we would think it wouldn’t have any real impact at all until 2013 even if then, depending on what task they choose to take. But so the bottom line answer to your question is we don’t expect much impact for our 2012 results.
James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.
Colby Synesael – Cowen: Great, I’ve got two questions. Just wanted to go back to the question that Schildkraut asked about lease renewals. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color are you expecting a larger percentage of your portfolio to renew leases in 2012 versus 2011. And then my other question just had to touch back on the AT&T and Verizon current LTE build outs. As we move into call it the second stage of their build out when they reached the majority of their POPs in 2012. Can you talk about how we shift in terms of activity and maybe fill in what the financial opportunity tied to that could be? Is it more, is it less, or is the same over the next few years like what we’ve seen in the last year? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: On the renewal we are not anticipating any material change in the level of the rate in 2012 versus ’11 versus ’10, versus ’09 for that matter. It’s always been around 99% renewal rates and we think as well that we were seeing. In terms of the AT&T Verizon activity, what happens historically is when a carrier moves through with a new technology upgrade they will launch that and roll that out a nation-wide basis and then depending on activity levels, they will cell-split and in-fill with new tenancies. The difference is, you’ll get similar revenue contributions of a third to a half of new tenancies as you amendments. So it’s a volume difference in terms of number of sites touched, but over time, it’s actually worked out that the contributions have been fairly steady during periods of both new technology rollout as well as in-fill and cell-splitting periods.
Colby Synesael – Cowen: Great, thank you.
Operator: Next go to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Phil Cusick – JPMorgan: Hey guys. Thanks. Just a quick clarification. The iDEN churn that will probably start ramping, I think in 2013, do you think that will be additive to the 1.5% that you talked about earlier? Or is that sort of replacing other things that have been turning for one time?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, it might be slightly additive, but it’ll also be replacing other things that have still not fully turned off like AT&T Cingular or Santanio Centennial, or the tail end of Altel, Verizon selling all kinds of – just as other things are rolling out.
Phil Cusick – JPMorgan: And it’s got a steady number of churn towers over a five year period something like that?
Brendan Cavanagh: It is a steady number that we’ve kind of worked around in terms of a negotiation with Sprint, but we are not going to get into the exact details of that.
Phil Cusick – JPMorgan: Great. And then, you mentioned a few minutes ago but at a conference last month I think you talked about leverage or happy with where it is you could even take it up. What the conversation internally you and with the Board happening right now are on leverage? Are you fairly happy with where you are? And is there a conversation about taking it up?
Jeff Stoops: We are happy with where it is and there really is not a conversation about taking it up, because we think where we are right now is the right place to be.
Phil Cusick – JPMorgan: Good. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment.
Michael Rollins – Citi Investment Research: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Just on the organic growth, if you could break down, you may have done this earlier, but just a little bit more specificity if we look at 3Q site leasing revenue growth I think of your sites 39, if you could break it down from internal growth versus external growth and then just how to think about those components moving into 201? I think, last quarter you may have given an indication of internal or organic of around 9% and just looking for an update on that? Thank you.
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think that’s still where we are Mike, 9%, of which 3% of the 9% comes from escalators or slightly above that then the rest would be from new incremental revenue added in the last couple quarters predominantly from amendments but also from some new tenancies. So everything above that you would I think correctly is as inorganic growth.
Michael Rollins – Citi Investment Research: And that be same for the quarter as well?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. And that would include new builds, new builds goes in the inorganic calculation and not the organic calculation.
Michael Rollins – Citi Investment Research: And just one other question you think 3% from escalators is that a gross 3% and then we’ve got to minus some churn off of that if you can, I think you mentioned earlier that churn was about 1.5%, so how does that factor into the calculus?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, we have the escalators are between 3% and 3.5% on a gross basis that’s not net of churn. Churn is a separate item but it is netted into the 9% growth calculation.
Jeff Stoops: Yes, so the incremental is what’s netted of the churn, not the escalator.
Michael Rollins – Citi Investment Research: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Next we’ll go to the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: Thanks and just two quick ones, just to clarify and I know we’ve kind of belabored this on the Nextel churn, but it sounds like there is no real point during the duration of the wind down or you hit a cliff or a wall or some jolt to the run rate into churn. Is that the appropriate way of thinking about it?
Jeff Stoops: Yes.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: Okay, good. And then just, to follow-up on Phil’s question about leverage. You do have a little over $1 billion of debt maturities in ’13 and ’14 and I was just interested in your thinking right now and you didn’t talked about how you have upwards or around a $1 billion of total liquidity to deploy. It seems like you are inclined to deploy it. What would change your mind? What would make you more cautious, more thoughtful about building cash? Are there triggers you look for and the credit markets or the economy, anything you can do to sort of help us think that would be great?
Jeff Stoops: Well, first and foremost, we will be watching the 2013 May maturity date. That focal point is in part the reason for like answer to Phil that we are not really looking to take leverage up as we head into that refinancing obligation and we will watch what we spend and what our refinancing is going into that brand. But that obviously will be a primary determinant of exactly where leverage is as we head into 2012.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: And do you have any changing thoughts on like the mix of secured and unsecured convertible securities and stuff like that?
Jeff Stoops: We continue to I think have an business that’s ideally suited for secured financing. We are with a very steady business and therefore it is very suited to the covenants style lending that you see there and an exchange for that you get great rates and it’s on a relative basis great rates and so we like that, you should assume we will continue to do as much in that market as we can and that’s a combination of the securitization market and the traditional term loan A and term loan B market. And then over and above that, we’ll be looking at the various options for unsecured financing.
Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you speakers and at this time, there are no further questions in queue.
Jeff Stoops: Great. So we will end the call now. I want to thank everybody for joining us and the next time we talk, it will actually be 2012 and we look forward to reporting our fourth quarter results. Thank you.
Operator: With that, ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for the day. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Director of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.
Mark DeRussy: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for SBA second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking including but not limited to any guidance for 2011 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business, everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night’s press release and our SEC filings, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we may make. Our statements are as of today August 2, 2011, and we have no obligations to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments today will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website spasite.com. With that out of the way I will turn the call over to Brendan to comment on our second quarter results.
Brendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark, good morning. As you saw from our press release last night our second quarter financial and operational results were very strong. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for site leasing revenues, Tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA and increased those elements of our full year 2011 outlook. Total revenues were a $171.1 million up 10.7% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the second quarter were a $150.2 million or a 14% increase over the second quarter of 2010. Our leasing revenue growth was driven by both organic and portfolio growth. The vast majority of our site leasing revenue comes from the U.S. and its territories with approximately 3% of total leasing revenue coming from international operations. We had an FX benefit of only $32,000 in the quarter. Site leasing segmenting operating profit was $118.1 million or an increase of 16% over the second quarter of 2010. Site leasing contributed 97.6% of our total segment operating profit. Tower cash flow for the second quarter of 2011 was a $118.6 million or a 14.3% increase over the year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 80.1% compared to 79.5% in the year earlier period. We have now close to two consecutive quarters of tower cash flow margins of 80% notwithstanding the higher number of less mature new build towers we have put into operation. This success reflects both the strength of our organic revenue growth as well as our cost control including the results of our ground lease purchase efforts. Operationally, we are experiencing strong leasing demand both domestically and internationally. We had one of the most active quarters ever in terms of leasing activity. Our incremental organic leasing revenue added per tower during the quarter accelerated from both the year earlier period and the first quarter of this year. Amendments which were predominantly from AT&T and Verizon continue to show strength and contributed over one-half of total incremental leasing revenue added in the quarter. It is primarily the high level of newly signed leases and amendments in the second quarter that drives the increase to our full year site leasing revenue outlook. Our leasing backlog right now is good and we expect that the third quarter will be another solid one in terms of customer activity and we expect high levels of activity to continue throughout 2011. Our services revenues were $20.9 million compared to $22.8 million in the year earlier period. Services segment operating profit was $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared to $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2010. Services segment operating profit margin was 13.9% compared to 12.4% in the year earlier period a 150 basis point improvement. In the second quarter, we had a few projects pushed back several months on the services side most of which have now commenced. We are expecting a larger second half for services and we are maintaining our full year 2011 guidance for services revenue. SG&A expenses for the second quarter was $16.8 million including non cash compensation charges of $3.1 million and acquisition related expenses of $1 million. SG&A expenses were $15.7 million in the year earlier period, including non cash compensation chargers of $2.7 million and $1.4 million of acquisition related expense. Adjusted EBITDA was $109.5 million or a 14.6% increase over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin continue to grow and was 64.8% in the second quarter of 2011 up from 62.3% in the year earlier period, a 250 basis point increase. Equity free cash flow for the second quarter of 2011 was $63.7 million compared to $54.2 million in the year earlier period, an increase of 17.6%. Equity free cash flow per share for the second quarter of 2011 was $0.57 compared to $0.47 in the year earlier period, an increase of 21.3%. Our strong growth in equity free cash flow per share is a result of solid adjusted EBITDA growth combined with a declining share count. Net loss attributable to SBA Communications Corporation during the second quarter was $29.8 million compared to a net loss of $83.7 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the second quarter was $0.27 compared to a net loss per share of $0.72 in the year earlier period. Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were a $112.3 million, down from a $115.7 million a year ago due to stock repurchase activity. Quarter end shares outstanding were down to $111.4 million. In the second quarter we acquired 140 towers and built 151 towers ending the quarter with 9574 towers owned and the rights to manage approximately 4400 additional communication sites. As of June 30th, we owned 8988 towers in the US and its territories and 586 in international markets. Total cash capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2011 were a $111.3 million consisting of $4.6 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $106.7 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Non-discretionary CapEx included about $500,000 of storm related damage above estimated insurance recovery from tornadoes, floods and mud slides that impacted a number of our markets in the second quarter. Discretionary cash CapEx for the second quarter include $68.6 million incurred in connection with acquisitions, exclusive of any working capital adjustments; $27 million in new tower construction including construction in progress and $3.9 million for growth augmentations and tower upgrades. The augmentation figure does not reflect approximately $2.6 million or 67% of cash reimbursements paid by our customers. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $9.8 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our investments in land are both strategically beneficial and almost always aggregately accretive. As of June 30, 2011, approximately 33.4% of our tower sites were located on land that we own or control for more than 50 years. That number jumped 130 basis points in one quarter alone. Approximately, 70% of our tower sites were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years. The average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control has been extended to 32 years. At this point I’m going to turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks Brendan. We are very active in the capital markets during the second quarter. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock for $75 million on an average $38.59. We currently have $225 million remaining under our existing $300 million optimization. Stock repurchases continue to be an important component within our overall capital allocation process to maximize shareholder value. We continue to view them as a tool to be utilized opportunistically rather than systematically. As of the end of the quarter we have cumulatively repurchased seven million shares on an average price of $37.19 since we began our open market repurchase activities in late 2009. Additionally, we took several steps to improve our overall liquidity position and to further improve our debt maturity profile. First we extended the maturity of our existing $500 million revolving credit facility from February 2015 out to June 2016. We also increased permitted total secured leverage on the act of securing the facility from five times to six times. As of the end of the second quarter the total amount available to us under this facility was the full $500 million. Secondly, we obtained the new $500 million seven year senior secured term loan B. The term loan was issued at 99.75% at par and will bear interest at either the base rate plus 1.75% with a 2% base rate floor or LIBOR plus 2.75 % for the 1% LIBOR floor. The term loan will mature in June 2018 a year in which we previously had no debt maturing. The proceeds from the term loan were used to pay down the existing balance on the revolver and the remainder can be used for general corporate purposes including stock repurchases. Additional information about the term loan and changes to our revolver can be found in 8-K which we filed on July 7, 2011. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of total debt. We had cash, cash equivalents, short term restricted cash and short term investments of $305 million resulting in net debt of $3.2 billion. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times. The same approximate level that it has been for the last seven quarters. Our net secured debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.3 times. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a very strong 2.8 times. As of the end of the second quarter, our debt had a weighted average annual cash coupon of 4.7% and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately five years. 86% of our total debt was fixed rated. We believe our balance sheet is in excellent shape as we have no material debt maturities prior to 2013 and we believe we have ample liquidity to meet our business plan and growth objectives. The $500 million we had available to us under our revolver combined with our cash, cash equivalent, short term investments and short term restricted cash of $305 million, gave us total liquidity of approximately $805 million as of the end of the quarter. Including anticipated equity free cash flow over the next 12 months we have over $1 billion of committed and available liquidity. With that I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. As you have heard we did have a great quarter. In the quarter we beat estimates, signed up enough new organic business to meaningfully raise our full year 2011 outlook and secured $1 billion of liquidity during the next 12 months. I feel we ended the quarter in one of, if not the strongest positions in our history. Embedded in all of that continues to be a great macro environment for additional customer spending both domestically and internationally. It will be hard to imagine that AT&T or Verizon could be any busier on network development. Combined they have contributed the majority of our new leasing growth in the first half of 2011. We expect materially the same levels of activity from these two customers as we finish the year and throughout 2012. On top of that it appears Sprint is moving closer to launching the implementation of Network Vision, which we expect will be a material source of additional business for us. Our international business is doing well and when you add it all up you get a strong expected finish for SBA in 2011 and a very strong 2012. I want to hit on a number of topics that I know are of interest to our investors before we open it up for questions. The first topic is Sprint. We are in the process of negotiating a master agreement with Sprint regarding the implementation of Network Vision and potential network sharing. We are optimistic that an agreement will be reached but it has not happened to-date and it may never happen. Our increased 2011 outlook does not include any impact from Network Vision or Network Sharing. With respect to the increases in our 2011 outlook, the vast majority of the increases attributable to organic leasing business signed in the second quarter which will begin to accrue revenue sometime in the second half. A small piece of the increase for 2011 is due to additional acquisitions, more of the benefit from these acquisitions will be enjoyed in 2011. We intend to provide our initial 2012 outlook when we release our third quarter results as we have in the last couple of years.  With respect to acquisitions and portfolio growth, the number of opportunities that are available to us has grown materially since our last call. Just as importantly, things have settled down somewhat with respect to the ramifications of an AT&T/T-Mobile merger. Where there is significant same-tower overlap, there is evaluation conversation and sellers expected. It is the logical response I thought would happen, and now I’m pleased to say that we are seeing it in the market. I’m confident that our company will continue to grow materially through portfolio growth on terms that continue to meet or exceed our unlevered internal rate of return targets. We posted an increase in acquisition activity in the second quarter and we are working on a much larger pool of opportunity, some of which we expect to place under contract before yearend. While this acquisition activity will likely have little impact to our 2011 financial results because of timing, full impact would be enjoyed in 2012 and beyond. We continue to pursue portfolio growth opportunities both domestically and internationally. We are very pleased with our international results so far. In our more developed markets Canada and Panama, we are on track to produce high teens or better unlevered internal rates of return. I fully expect to be able to say the same thing about Costa Rica in two years, which is a market that for us will consist entirely of newly-built towers. While we have enjoyed good success so far internationally, it is hard work. You have to be very committed as to both time and resources. You have to become part of local community and gain the trust of your customers. In most new international markets, carriers have no familiarity with independent tower ownership and operation. Most importantly, you have to be very selective about the markets you enter.  We are very pleased with the markets we have chosen, but we have passed on many more international opportunities that we have pursued. We hope to expand to our international business into additional markets, but only with the same selectivity as we have in the past. Portfolio growth will be materially and positively impacted this year by new tower builds. We had a great second quarter building a 151 towers in the U.S. and internationally, that is the most we have built in a quarter in over 10 years. We expect triple digit new build production to continue in the third and fourth quarters.  We had another quarter of material stock repurchase activity. Through stock repurchases we have reduced our share count meaningfully in the last 18 months. We evaluate and execute stock repurchases opportunistically based on the absolute price of our stock and relative to acquisition opportunities. In the second quarter that analysis favored stock repurchases. Going forward we will conduct similar evaluations quarterly, assuming the evaluations shows similar long term financial impact from a potential acquisition or stock repurchase our bias remains towards portfolio growth. Whether portfolio growth or stock repurchases we have plenty of liquidity for investment. We are very pleased with the results of our $500 million institutional loan issue, we achieved tight pricing and execution. We carefully considered our choice of market and choose the floating rate market primarily to diversify our funding sources, but also because of floating rate market was quicker, cheaper, more stable and more certain than the securitization market. We believe we achieved an annual interest rate that is approximately a 100 basis points lower than a comfortable seven year issue would have been in the securitized market. Based on all of our analysis around future potential movements in LIBOR we believe that we will pay no more and likely less than aggregate interest under our new $500 million institutional loan, than had we issued in the securitization market. More importantly this is very low cost capital that we fully expect to be able to invest accretively and at value creating ways for our shareholders. Even the current state of capital markets affairs, we feel very good to have this much liquidity readily available. Before we open it up for questions, I do want to recognize the contributions of our employees and customers to our success. Our employees work really hard to achieve the goals of our customers. Our employees do a great job, our customers recognize that and as a result we are a preferred provider for our customer’s network needs. Our customers are and we think will remain extremely busy improving and expanding their wireless networks. We look forward to continued success in 2011 and beyond. Mary at this time will open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Suhail Chandy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Thank you for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. You know, congratulations on this, you have mentioned that you were open to now a masterly figuring end. Any color that you can provide would be very helpful. My specific question is, one, in the past when I had initiated on this and I had kind of looked at the economics my understanding is that side by side negotiations have superior economics. Now, you are obviously changing to go towards mass lease (ph) could you possibly give us kind of some of the criteria that you would evaluate this on.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah. I think the reason that we may likely enter into a master agreement with Sprint where we have not done that previously is that the number of issues that are being addressed vis-à-vis the sprint negotiation are such that it essentially requires that it would be done in a master type format. And our prior course of action really has nothing to do with the fundamental view of master versus lease specific. It really is all driven by economics to us and the same will be true as we hope to move forward and see if we can get something done with the Sprint. But, really, the master concept versus lease specific is much more due to the number of issues that are being discussed with spreads.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Great. Thanks. Just one housekeeping question before I go back into the queue. The relevant covenant that you have on net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, is that still 8.9?
Jeffrey Stoops: No. That is now 9.5.
Suhail Chandy – Wedbush Securities: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much and good morning. Jeff you talked about the good leasing activity that you are seeing. I think one of the things that was striking about the PCS call earlier today was that they are talking about the strong demand of daily usage. It's obviously not a surprise, but clearly driving higher CapEx. They also noted that they were going to be deploying microwave backhaul. So I just wondered if you could just give us a little bit more color about what you are seeing your customers doing in general in terms of trying to deal with the high usage demands from smartphones. Are you seeing a lot of sales betting going on? Are you seeing more use of microwave backhaul and other color, if you could give us about how the growth and data traffic is really benefitting SPA?
Jeffrey Stoops: We are seeing all of that Simon, but what we are seeing in particular varies by carrier. Verizon still is mostly, but not entirely, focused on overlaying its existing network to be able to offer 4G service. AT&T is also now fully engaged in that, but also still self splitting and building out some additional capacity and then as you move into different folks such as a Metro. Metro given their particular spectrum position and the choice of offering 4G service through the same spectrum that they are offering 3G service is kind of more by definition a cell splitting type of deployment. So it really kind of varies across the board based on carriers, the spectrum positions and the technologies they are using, but everyone’s relatively pretty busy.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: And just a follow-up finally on the Sprint stuff. If you sign an MLA in the next, let's say, a month or so, is that going to – are you going to be able to get much in the way of revenues in say Q4, is it really going to bleed over into 2012? How quickly can they move on?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, there would be potentially a couple of different aspects to that and we need to keep things extremely general, because we don’t have an agreement yet. But there can be a non-cash pickup that might be faster and more substantive and then there could also be a cash pickup that would be driven by actually how much work Sprint really gets done this year.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Yeah, thanks. I wanted to piggyback on some of Simon’s comments there. Jeff, I appreciate the color you have given us on the Sprint process and that in fact your 2011 increase does not include Sprint vision or sharing. Can you talk a little bit about MetroPCS, because like Simon was mentioning, Metro just ended their conference call, so they were going to be increasing the CapEx guidance in 2011, increasing microwave usage, have you noticed the application jet from MetroPCS? And when somebody does a microwave, what’s typically the amendment revenue that you see?
Jeffrey Stoops: We are seeing Metro to be active, I wouldn’t put them in the same nor would I think anyone would expect them to be in the same category of contribution as an AT&T or Verizon, but they are out there doing things. And the microwave pricing, Ric, depends primarily on two things, whether the size of the microwave dish and whether it is a one half or a piggyback half where it comes in and then goes back out with a second dish. And that’s a pretty wide spectrum of pricing when you consider all those things and I’m going to give you a broad range. They go from $300 a month for a single small dish to well over a $1000 for bigger double installations.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Okay. And the second question is on the M&A side, good to see the pipeline flowing again and people’s expectations on prices. Can you tell us a little bit about where you are seeing M&A pricing domestic and international and then on your tower builds, what kind of returns are you looking for on a day one tower build cash on cash and where do you think you can grow it?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, the US pricing is probably in the 17ish times, maybe 18 times range or what I would call average high growth assets going forward, the kind of stuff that we’ve focused on. Internationally, the same assets, at least the stuff that we are interested in pursuing is running hundreds of basis points lower than that on a TCF basis. So, we continue to be attracted to that, again, for the right asset where our risk adjusted returns internationally will well exceed our returns on a US basis. On the new builds, the key for us continues to be building towers where over time on a portfolio basis you will average 1.5 to 2 tenants or better. All the towers that we build are one tenant on day one, but they generally will need to see some additional growth before our goals are fully met. So, and you get a fairly wide range between US and international on day one cash on cash, but it would be mid to high single digit day one returns, which obviously would grow materially with the addition of a second tenant.
Operator:  And Ric, does that answer your question?
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Yes, it does, thank you.
Operator:  Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs: Hi, thanks, good morning. Maybe just one follow up on Sprint, there are several questions. As you said, last year you weren’t philosophically opposed to lease modifications that others were signing, it was just a different view on the economics. I’m wondering, it doesn’t seem like this is the case, but is there any sort of philosophical hang up you have around allowing spectrum flexibility and/or allowing non-controlled entities on to an incumbent network? And then second question just to follow-up on Ric’s. On new builds, obviously very strong activity in the quarter and going forward. Has anything changed around the anchor tenant profile that you are requiring in these new builds? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: The first question Jason, you know, we are not opposed to network sharing, I think that’s what you are getting at with the question as long as it looks like the right economic deal for us and obviously has to be mutually acceptable to both parties. So, now we are not fundamentally opposed to that and that is in fact one of the aspects that is being discussed with Sprint. There is really no change on the new builds in terms of the anchor tenants, I mean, most of the new builds that we did in the quarter; actually more of the majority were in Costa Rica where our anchor tenant was either Telefónica or Oclaro, so pretty good credit quality there and that continues to be the case in the U.S. as well.
Jason Armstrong – Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks Jeff.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Two questions please. First, I noticed that gross margins on the site leasing side continue to tick up. We are just wondering if that is a function of higher tenancy, just continued execution if there is something else there. And then, if I can ask another question about Sprint and your MLA negotiations and you highlighted some of the complexities that you go into figuring out the right structure for that contract. One of the things with other tower operators is that their negotiations do include some components of iDEN decommissioning which in some cases are capping the downsize from that process which will take place. So, obviously over several years. Is that one of the complexities that’s kind of impacting the timeframe around coming to conclusion on that agreement? 
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes, the – one of the points the major points the elements of the discussions with Sprint includes the timing of – their desired timing of decommissioning iDEN. So that is one of the elements that is at play here. Brendan, do you want to take the margin question?
Brendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yeah, Jonathan, margins do continue to climb every quarter and, you know, it’s function of a couple of things. Obviously as we add revenue growth through organic lease up we're adding close to a 100% margin in many cases so that helps to continue to see our margins pushing up. In addition we’ve done some things on the cost side to keep costs relatively flat, even though we’ve been growing the portfolio. The primary item there is the ground lease purchase program and how we’ve retired a lot of our ground leases and reduced that expense, which is our largest expense. 
Jonathan Schildkraut – Evercore Partners: All right, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin, RBC Capital. Please go ahead. 
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital: Yes. I had a question about international. I’m wondering if you’re seeing competition from other players entering the markets that you recently entered, and then with respect to the portion of revenues, the 3% that was mentioned, could that trend towards double digit anytime in the next few years?
Jeffrey Stoops: We are seeing competition and the revenue trend will continue to grow, won’t be double digit certainly this year, Jonathan, may be on a run rate basis close by the end of next year but maybe not as well. Broadly speaking though, yes, we could get to 10% within say a couple of years.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital: And the competition that doesn’t affect your economic on new builds, does it?
Jeffrey Stoops: No, not in the markets where we’re building heavily because we’ve got certain deals struck with these folks, but kind of competition would impact any type of new activity outside what’s been contracted for. It's very similar to the way it works in the U.S.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital: And then apart from Telefonica and Oclaro, is there a third or fourth carrier worth mentioning at this point that might start to move a little?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, in Costa Rica, there is the existing incumbent which will also we believe would be a customer which is Esay (ph). They are also in the midst of an upgrade to 3G technology. So, there will be – when the existing build out is done, there will be three fully developed operating carriers down there plus we’re seeing some new markets entrants in the form of internet type players and other types of, I would say, smaller wireless providers. So it’s actually – it’s exciting market for us and one that we have a great deal of optimism for.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital: Thanks. And then turning to the U.S. You didn’t sign an MLA last year with another carrier although your two peers did, and yet that doesn’t seem to be pulling down your momentum. So my question then for this year is regardless of an MLA or lack of MLA are you seeing momentum in the second half related to network vision (inaudible) guidance or is that not likely to kick in until next year?
Jeffrey Stoops: That’s specifically network vision right? 
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital: Yes.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, I mean it could happen in the fourth quarter, we would have to see more activity though than we’re seeing now, I mean, it’s not in our outlook and I wouldn’t want to even suggest to folks that it does end up in our actual 2011 results this year. It could, but it’s not anything that we are guiding anyone to.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Clay Moran with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Clay Moran – Benchmark: Thanks, good morning. On the increased M&A opportunities, I am assuming that’s primarily in the U.S. but I just wanted to ask. Is that U.S. or what percentage is U.S. versus international? And then also on the foreign markets it seems you are pretty focused on your current markets. Is that the case or is finding a new market also a priority?
Jeffrey Stoops: Most of the portfolio opportunities we are seeing are in the U.S. but not entirely. But well more than 50%. And in terms of our international focus this year, we are very open and actually looking for one additional market in which to enter, but we’ve got a lot of work to do right now particularly in Costa Rica to meet the build out rolls and the launch goals of Oclaro and Telefonica. So we have our hands full and it's working well, but we’re also devoting some time to looking for a new country as well.
Clay Moran – Benchmark: And now it would also be I assume in Central or South America.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, that’s our primary focus, continues to be at this point in the western hemisphere.
Clay Moran – Benchmark: All right. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JP Morgan, please go ahead.
Richard Choe – JP Morgan: Hi this is Richard Choe for Phil. Just a little clarification on the potential Sprint MLA, would you view a Network Sharing agreement carrier as an amendment or more like a new tenant or something in between, and then do you expect to see any kind of follow on network service revenue and is any of that in guidance?
Jeffrey Stoops: It's a good question on the first one. I’m not sure we thought that through in terms of classification. I think it's probably more of an amendment, but we’ll obviously cross that bridge more definitively when we get to it. And there is no – yes, we do expect or we would anticipate a large increase in the future of services related business, none of which is in our 2011 outlook.
Richard Choe – JP Morgan:  And I guess one follow up with – you are saying that the M&A environment has kind of changed for the better and people are realizing I guess the difference with AT&T/T-Mobile merger. Does that change your outlook on buy backs, do you expect them to stay at a high level and shift little bit or do you have enough money and daring enough cash to do both?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, we certainly have enough liquidity. Our primary governor will be where we want to maintain a target leverage and right now we are comfortable with target leverage being where it is particularly given what we see are great opportunities in both the portfolio growth areas and stock repurchases. So, in other words, if we do a lot of portfolio growth we probably will be doing less stock repurchases and vice versa in any given quarter.
Richard Choe – JP Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays, please go ahead.
James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. If you could, on a couple of potential resources of revenue, you have talked quite a bit about Sprint. But if you could talk about perhaps at this point on a public safety network, what you are seeing on a Clearwire and also if any of the growth we are seeing in WiFi deployments by cable operators they are a potential source of growth for you? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, I mean those are all potential sources of growth James. The public safety idea gets a lot of discussion. But in terms of actual implementation we haven’t seen any signs of that just yet. Clearwire seems to be more holding kind of steady in terms of its network and not doing a whole lot at least with us right now, I suspect that has something to do with where that all comes out with respect for them in the Sprint Network Vision scenario. And we are seeing a number of additional types of local WiFi, WiMAX internet providers, we are seeing an increase in wireless backhaul providers, we are seeing an increase in interested activity from fiber providers, we want to install hubs in our compounds and we haven’t yet seen anything specific from the cable providers and particularly the cable consortium but they have a lot of valuable spectrum there and that I would anticipate over time something gets done with it.
James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital: Great, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo, please go ahead.
Gray Powell – Wells Fargo Securities: Good morning, thanks for the taking the questions. We just had a couple of them. I admit this can be a little bit detail focused, I understand that the increase to your rental revenue guidance is mostly organic. But the language in the press release, around the 9% organic growth commentary was unchanged, is that sort of a rounding error, like maybe before you were looking for 8.9% growth, now you are looking for 9.4% growth?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yes.
Gray Powell – Wells Fargo Securities: Got it. And then can you give us a breakdown of the leasing activity related to new sale sites versus amendments in Q2 and what your longer term expectations are for the demand drivers?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, the number of amendments versus new sale sites was probably three or four to one, I mean, the level of amendment activity is truly staggering right now. In terms of revenue it maybe 55-45, 60-40. Longer term I think we are kind of, I think ultimately you are going to see more of a movement back to brand new sales sites, but maybe not for at least a year given all the, particularly the more of the Verizon and AT&T are doing around 4G, all of which will for the most part take it forward with amendment.
Gray Powell – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. That’s very helpful. And I apologize if you have already answered this one. But on the tower expansion plans, it just looks like guidance includes roughly a little over 410 acquisitions and then another 410 new builds. Can you give us the breakout of US versus international towers for each category?
Jeffrey Stoops: We can, can you call Mark back on that.
Gray Powell – Wells Fargo Securities: No problem at all. Thanks a lot.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America, please go ahead.
David Barden – BofA/Merrill Lynch: Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just two, if you could, one, we talked about the strong margin that you guys are seeing year-to-date, just looking at the guidance with respect to the magnitude of the revenue increase for the full year relative to the kind of moving of the midpoint of the EBITDA number by chewing the low end. It seems to suggest that maybe there is some change in the margin mix coming, I was wondering if that was related to the new tower builds and the lower margins that you have on the those at the outset. If you could kind of just speak to that real quick. And then, I guess, second Jeff just kind of continuing to probe on this topic. I guess, Sprint has kind of t'ed up this analyst day that they are going to have in early October and they have been negotiating this kind of “fourth leg” to their 4G strategy beyond the Vision and the LightSquared and the Clearwire, and it has created a lot of speculation about is it a spectrum company, is it Charlie Ergen and Dish, is it may be taking out Clearwire altogether. And if you had an educated guess on where you thought that might shake out by October, that would be interesting to hear. Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: David, just given the – I probably said way more than I already should about the Sprint negotiations, I’m not going to touch that last one. In terms of the margin, we don’t really see any real changes, I mean, maybe just kind of conservative swaggered SG&A.
David Barden – BofA/Merrill Lynch: Yeah, I mean, I think what you said is true though and that there are a lot of sites that we are building that are new builds as Jeff mentioned earlier, day one have one tenant on it and so the margin is obviously not as great as those gets blended in. So you will see some revenue bump as you add those tenants to those sites with lesser margin. But for the part I think it is just conservatism around expenses and other things.
Jeffrey Stoops: What we don’t see anything in the second half that’s material or even smaller than material kind of change in the mix and the margins, particularly as they roll in over time.
David Barden – BofA/Merrill Lynch: And I apologize if I could just – I know Jeff you have said more than what you want to say and I thank you for those answers, but just last thing on kind of the back and forth with the Sprint conversations is, are you at all concerned that if you don’t come up with an MLA that’s beneficial for both parties that Sprint would be more inclined to put new business and amendments with other tower companies and be pulling down iDEN sites sooner on the FDA network, and are they kind of using that stick in terms of their negotiations with you guys?
Jeffrey Stoops: No. I mean I fully – we appreciate given the complexities of what Sprint is trying to accomplish, why this has to be in the form of an MLA and I really haven’t thought about it from that perspective because I think we are headed down a path where we are likely to end up with something that obviously has been surely agreeable to both parties.
David Barden – BofA/Merrill Lynch: Okay. thanks guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Next we have Mr. Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins – Citi Investment Research: Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Jeff, just a follow up on – just some of the disclosures that you do, as American Tower is pushing towards the REIT conversion, have you given more thought to disclosing metrics on a week basis some of the metrics that we investors care about as well as the ones that you care about recognizing that for you that decision point might be often it says future by at least a few years, but maybe providing investors with more information as people may start comparing tower companies to a larger universe of real estate investments.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah. It is something Mike that we kicked around here internally. We haven’t come to any decision yet. I mean, it is a little bit farther off for us than the other guys as you well said, but it is an issue that we are continuing to consider whether we get well ahead of a potential REIT conversion for ourselves by providing the REIT type data. So, stay tuned, we don’t have any decisions yet.
Michael Rollins – Citi Investment Research: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: It’s been a busy day. I do have a couple of quick follow-ups. I think you have mentioned maintenance CapEx was up a little bit because of storm damages, but you did say that guidance up for maintenance CapEx just wondering what else might be involved there in splitting US versus international, and another minor item, cash taxes were up a little bit. Is that also being driven by international?
Brendan Cavanagh: Hey Ric it's Brendan. On the CapEx side it's almost all due to some of the storm related damage. We obviously had some higher non-discretionary CapEx during the second quarter that was due entirely to some of the damage we incurred from the tornados and other significant storms during the quarter and some of the costs that will incur, the cash expenditures that will incur related to that will actually carry over into Q3 which is why there is also some additional increase for the balance of the year. There is some international maintenance expense too with some of the sites that we bought down there, that’s included in that guidance. On the cash taxes side, it's really not about the international markets. We have had a few areas in particular in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, where we have seen our NOLs last a little bit faster and we’ve also had some timing shifts with certain states where estimated payments are made this year instead of being delayed to next year that kind of thing. So some of it's timing and some of it is recurring increase probably about half and half in terms of the bump up.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: The maintenance CapEx with the storm damage, is any of that reimbursable from the tenants or is it all borne by you guys?
Brendan Cavanagh: It is not from the tenants. We do have insurance that allows us to recover a portion of it, but the increase that we’ve made is, in our guidance is beyond the insurance recoveries.
Ric Prentiss – Raymond James: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: At this time we have no more questions in queue.
Jeffrey Stoops: All right. Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to joining you again with our third quarter results. Thanks.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Pam Kline, Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Pamela J. Kline: Thank you for joining us this morning for SBA's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kurt Bagwell, our Chief Operating Officer, and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I need to get the standard SEC disclosure out. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2009 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings. Particularly those set forth in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2008, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, May 5, 2009, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com. Brendan, would you please comment on the first quarter?
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Thanks Pam. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, our first quarter financial results were excellent. We exceeded the mid-point of our guidance for site leasing revenues, site development revenues, Tower cash flow and equity free cash flow. We were above the high-end of our guidance for adjusted EBITDA. Total revenues were a $135.1 million; up 22.9% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $115.5 million or 29.2% increase over the first quarter of 2008. This site leasing revenue growth was driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Site leasing segment operating profit was $87.9 million or an increase of 30.6% over the first quarter of 2008. Site leasing contributed 97.1% of our total segment operating profit in the first quarter. Tower cash flow for the first quarter of 2009 was $89.3 million or 31.9% increase over the year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 78.7% up 120 basis points over the year earlier period. Our services revenues were $19.6 million compared to 20.5 million in the year earlier period or a 4.7% decrease. Services segment operating profit was $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2.4 million in the first quarter of 2008. Services segment operating profit margins were 13.3% in the first quarter of 2009, compared to 11.5% in the year earlier period. Kurt will discuss services in more detail shortly. SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $12.5 million, including non-cash compensation charges of 1.6 million and acquisition related expenses of 0.4 million. Acquisition related expenses were capitalized in all periods prior to 2009. SG&A expense was $10.5 million in the year earlier period, including non-cash compensation charges of 1.4 million and 0.9 million of one-time net benefit associated with the reduction of accruals that were originally recorded at estimated amounts. On a normalized basis, our cash SG&A expenses are only up approximately 5% over the year earlier period, despite portfolio growth of over 26% in 2008. Net loss during the first quarter was $17.9 million, compared to a net loss of 19.2 million in the year earlier period. Net loss for the first quarter of 2009 included a $5.9 million gain on the early extinguishment of our debt, net of the write-off or deferred financing fees. Net loss per share for the first quarter was $0.15, compared to a net loss per share of $0.18 in the earlier period. Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 118 million. In our press release and in our 10-Q, which will be filed soon, you will notice some restatements related to the accounting for our convertible note transactions. We will require to adopt APB 14-1, effective January 1st of this year. This accounting pronouncement requires that we bifurcate and record a fair value to debt and equity components of our convertible notes. This accounting results on us recording an initial discount to the principle balance of our convertible debt. Over the life of the instrument, a caring value is accreted up to its full face value to a non-cash interest expense. APB 14-1 required us through retroactively apply this new accounting and restate our prior period financial statements accordingly. Although the accounting rules have changed and our reporting will be somewhat different, the economic nature of the transactions has not changed. Adjusted EBITDA was $81.7 million in the first quarter of 2009 or a 32.9% increase over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 61.4%; up from 56.9% in the year earlier period. Once again, equity free cash flow increased materially in the quarter; reflecting strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Equity free cash flow for the first quarter of 2009 was $52.8 million; a 37.9% increase over the year earlier period. Equity free cash flow per share for the first quarter of 2009 was $0.45 or a 28.6% increase over the year earlier period. In the first quarter, we acquired seven towers and built 25 towers, ending the quarter with 7,884 towers owned and the right to manage approximately 5,000 additional communication sites. Total cash capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2009 were $11.7 million consisting of 1.6 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx, and $10.1 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx includes $4.1 million incurred in connection with land acquisitions and acquisition earn out. $5.1 million in new tower construction and 0.9 million for augmentations and tower upgrades. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $4.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. As of March 31, 2009, we own or control for more than 50 years the land underneath 26% of our towers. At this point, I'll turn things over to Pam, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Pamela J. Kline: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the first quarter with 2.5 billion of total debt. We had cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term restricted cash of a $126.5 million resulting a net debt of 2.4 billion. Our ability to repurchase some of our debt at discount continued in the first quarter. During the first quarter of 2009, we repurchased and privately negotiated in open market transactions. 52.3 million of our 0.375% convertible notes and 7.55 million of our CMBS notes, for 42 million in cash and approximately 618,000 shares of our Class A common stock. During the quarter, we issued approximately 274,000 shares in connection with acquisitions and our share count at quarter-end was approximately a 118.7 million. At March 31, 2009; our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times. This represents a reduction in leverage of 1.5 turns in just two quarters and demonstrates just how rapidly we're able to reduce leverage. At March 31, 2009, our net secured debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 5.3 times. As of quarter-end, 85% of our debt was fixed rate in a weighted average cash keep on all of our debt was 4.3% per year. Our first quarter cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest was a very strong 3.1 times. Subsequent to March 31, 2009, we have repurchased an additional 3.9 million of our 0.375% convertible senior notes and 9.8 million of our CMBS notes for 13.2 million in cash. In April, we issued 500 million of 4% convertible senior notes, due in 2014. The note per issued with an initial conversion price of $30.38. Growth proceeds from the offering of 488.1 million after deducting underwriting fees. We used 50 million of the proceeds to repurchase 2.016 million shares of our common stock. As we've done in the past with our convertible issuances, we used 61.6 million of the net proceeds and the proceeds of the warrant, we sold concurrently; to purchase a hedge, which effectively increases the conversion price to $44.64, which was a 180% of our stock price on a due to the transaction. The notes are due on October 2014, and the net proceeds will be used to repurchase annual retired debt and for general corporate purposes. In addition to this transaction, we unwound the hedges and warrants associated with the 264.1 million of our 0.375% convertible senior notes due 2010 that we had previously repurchased. We elected to receive the value associated with the unwinding of these hedges and warrant, which was approximately 13.5 million in shares of our stock. As a result, we have retired an additional 546,000 shares of our common stock. As of today we have 81.9 million of 0.375% convertible senior notes outstanding, 1.5 billion of CMBS notes outstanding and 116.4 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn it over to Kurt to discuss the operational results.
Kurt Bagwell: Thanks Pam and good morning. Now that you've seen and heard the numbers, you know why we feel very good about our start in 2009. The wireless infrastructure market has been busy. Our assets are right in the middle of the action and our employee teams performed very well. Our leasing results were good, our services division performed well, we built a lot of good new towers and operationally we provided very high level of service to all of our customers. We have fully integrated the three big tower portfolios we bought in the second half of last year and they have been leasing up well, well along with our legacy assets. Specifically related to our first quarter results, our gross tower leasing revenue signed in the quarter was good on both accumulative and a per tower basis. Activity was again highest from T-Mobile and AT&T, as they continue to expand their footprint and overlay their networks for 3G Technology. Other leasing activity was diversified amongst Verizon, MetroPCS, Leap and other regional carriers, along with activity from private and governmental entities deploying specialized systems. Activity from Clearwire has been picking up as well. Our leasing backlog has increased substantially since beginning of the year, leading us to believe that operationally, lease up will be greater in the second half of the year. 72% of our new revenue signed in first quarter came from new tenant leases while 28% came from amendments to existing leases. Rental rates with state firm in our averaged cash basis ramps across our 19,447 tenants increased to $1,913 per month. Brendan mentioned spending just $900,000 on tower augmentations in the quarter. This is by far the lowest augmentation rate per tower in the industry and further demonstrates the quality of our portfolio and the capacity remaining on our assets despite already having 2.5 tenants per tower on average. Our tower company employees continue to perform well; provides great customer service and continue to keep our cost in check. On the asset growth front, we closed on fewer towers in the first quarter as we made our balance sheet, a priority over portfolio growth. We bought seven towers during the quarter but we starting to ramp our acquisition activity backup and we expect to close some more towers in the next two quarters. Our new tower build team completed 25 new towers, their best first quarter since we've restarted the program four years ago. Our backlog in new tower build was strong and we expect to complete 80 to 100 new towers in 2009. This owning a new tower remains as tough as ever, which makes leasing towers price product, once we get through that process and place the asset into service. Our lease up statistics on these towers had been excellent today. On the services side of our business, Q1 was very solid. Our backlog was more diverse in most of 2008, as we continue to perform our core services of the last 20 years including tower acquisition, construction and technical services. The teams' put their time between new cell site development, augmentations of existing cell sites and overlay to existing cell sites, while posting good numbers for revenue and gross profit and what a typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for the services segment. Again, we feel good about our strong start to 2009 and look forward to the next three quarters as the wireless industry continues to progress rapidly. I'll now turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks Kurt and good morning everyone. The first quarter was another strong quarter for us and a continuation of the solid results that we've been proud to produce for the last several years. We continue to perform well operationally, our customers are busy investing in their networks, some are expected to stay that way, and we believe our future continues to look very bright. I want to address three topics and then we will open it up for questions. The first topic is our balance sheet. Our recent $500 million convertible note issuance materially improves our debt and liquidity profile and puts us in excellent shape to resume material portfolio growth. With the proceeds of the issuance, we have all the cash we need to payoff all of our hard maturities until 2013. Those are our remaining 0.375% convertible notes, our Optasite Credit Facility and our SBA Credit Facility. Given the strength of our business, we were confident in our ability even in very tough markets to access the capital that was needed to eliminate any maturity risk and we have now done so. Next, we will turn our tension to refinancing our 2005 CMBS. Even though that instrument does not mature, it does increase its interest rate and restricts certain cash flows if not refinanced by November 2010. Those are outcomes we intend to avoid and we are confident in our ability to do so. To appreciate our positioning, I encourage you to look at the net secured debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio disclosure in our press release and apply the proceeds of the convertible note issue to pay down secured debt. That will reduce the pro forma ratio to 4.2 times. This is the level well below three different secured financings that have been successfully completed in our industry since December and we don't even need that much secured leverage to refinance the 2005 CMBS. We are currently thinking about pursuing a secured financing in the fourth quarter of this year or first quarter of 2010. We have the luxury of waiting until then and by waiting, we believe the secured debt market will continue to approve SBA, our cash flows will continue to grow and we can reduce or eliminate any pre-payment penalty on the refinancing on the 2005 CMBS. Just for example, we choose to do a 600 to $800 million transaction, which we believe would be achievable based on expected cash flows and 4.0 to 5.0 turns of secured leverage. We could entirely refinance the 2005 CMBS and provide a material amount of additional proceeds for growing the company or partially refinancing the 2006 CMBS before November 2011. We have a lot of confidence around this outcome, so much so that we are comfortable in recommencing some acquisitions for cash this year. Because our industry in general and SBA in particular, has demonstrates such good access to capital, growing very difficult capital markets, I fully anticipate that as we move into 2010, we will once again be targeting 5% to 10% for more annual portfolio growth, which leads me to the second topic I'd like to discuss. While we have spent much of our focus over the last eight months on balance sheet positioning to address the dramatic changes in the capital markets. We believe there has been enough improvement in SBA and the capital markets, than it is appropriate to begin to return our focus back to the three-part strategy that has served us so well over the years in building shareholder value. Appropriate balance sheet, leverage, organic growth and operational execution and material portfolio growth. We remain committed to portfolio growth as the key component to increase equity free cash flow per share and shareholder wealth. You can see from the press release that we have taken some small steps in that direction which we believe will turn into bigger steps as we move through the rest of 2009 and into 2010. We continue to see a very positive environment for future tower cash flow growth. We also see a number of opportunities that give us confidence around our ability to grow the company 5% or 10% or more per year through portfolio growth for a number of years. Acquisition prices have declined in response to increased cost of capital, and we believe we will continue to find opportunities where the price and future growth will provide returns well above our cost of capital. Those are the reasons we like portfolio growth so much as it holds to increase shareholder wealth is because of our efficiency in terms of new asset cash flows into adjusted EBITDA and equity free cash flow. We are very good at integrating new towers into our portfolio and then operating them efficiently. You could see from our press release how much we have grown tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margin in the last year. The tower cash flow margin growth is particularly pleasing as each of our three large acquisitions last year came in with lower tower cash flow margins than the portfolio average at the time. We were pretty leanly at SBA. As an exercise to see just how leanly we operate our core leasing business, I would encourage you to strip out the services segment revenue and cost from SBA and each of our peers, and then re-run adjusted EBITDA margins. About 1.6 million of our cash SG&A each quarter relates to our services segment, which after subtracting that and the services revenue and associated gross profit implies a 71% adjusted EBITDA margin on our core leasing business. I believe that would be either equal to or higher than any other EBITDA margin in our industry on the core leasing business, even though our peers are several times our size. I want to note that we are committed to our services segment and this was only an exercise, but one that I hope demonstrates just how efficient we are in our core leasing business and how we can create additional value through portfolio growth. The third topic I want to touch on is the very favorable macro environment that we continue to find ourselves in SBA, not withstanding the difficult general economy around us. Within the telecom universe, wireless continues to grow in contribution an importance. For diversified companies like AT&T and Verizon, wireless is the most important segment and is expected to become more self overtime. Customer demand for SBA continues to be strong and reflects we believe the current and expected growth in wireless data. A lot of really smart people are betting that real money will be made in wireless data and that the consumer will pay increasing amounts of money for increasingly satisfying wireless data product and experience. Result so far support that belief, as data ARPU is increasing rapidly and Apple's results for sales of iPhones and applications have led to huge investments from others seeking to replicate those results, such as Microsoft, Google and Intel. 4G technology, which will provide greatly increased data speeds is actively being pursued by multiple providers. Total wireless minutes of use continue to grow at a rapid rate with data minutes growing much faster than voice minutes. To handle increasing data minutes of use at ever faster speeds, networks which handle both voice and data traffic needs continuous expansion and improvement even of growth in subscribers slows and voice minutes decline. As long as our customers find the wireless data business profitable and demand continues to grow, SBA should benefit. Wireless is a finite resource, the quality of which is impacted by a number of factors; the biggest of which are demand, spectrum and network. As demand grows, quality will suffer unless more spectrum is utilized or the network is improved. Where spectrum is limited, network expansion is typically the only solution. Proof of this maybe seen over the last 20 years in the form of increasing in kind of densities which has directly led to steady growth in revenue and cash flow per tower. While quarterly results will always vary somewhat particularly on a carrier-by-carrier basis, over the long-term, the basic themes I have outlined remained and I believe will continue to remain intact and remarkably steady. Those themes are the reasons we remained so optimistic about our future while we continue to invest in our business and why we are confident in our ability to create additional wealth for our shareholders. Before we open it up for questions, I do want to mention one very special item. This is our 10th year as a public company and our 20th year in operations. To celebrate, we will be rendering the opening at NASDAQ on June 16th, which is 10 years since today we went public. Through it all, the ups and the downs, I want to say on behalf of myself and our management team that we have thoroughly enjoyed every moment and the relationships we had developed over the years with our investors, customers and employees. I consider the SBA story a great success, and one that we are very proud of. I want to thank all of you for your part that you played in our success. And all of with that, at this time we're ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And first we will got to the line of Dave Coleman with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Dave Coleman - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Was there any one-time non-recurring revenues during the quarter, and if so how much were they. And then Kurt, can you just repeat the number of signed leases at the end of the quarter, and then Jeff you mentioned possibly doing a secured debt deal, second half of this year. Can you talk about what rate you'd anticipate getting on that debt deal, size you mentioned? Thanks.
Brendan Cavanagh: Dave, this is Brendan. There were no non-recurring one-time type items in our revenue numbers for this quarter.
Jeffrey Stoops: Dave, on the tenant count, it was 19,447.
Brendan Cavanagh: On the financing day, one of the reasons we do want to wait until the fourth quarter, as we see rates continuing to decline as they have since the beginning of the year. I would hold out a couple of -- well actually one example in particular, Carr (ph) recently did a secured debt deal which I think the effective deal came out at 8.25% and that was just couple of weeks ago and is now trading around 7.5%. So we think the markets will continue to improve, we think our company in particular will continue to look good and perform well and also the banks loan market is starting to reopen which actually has been shut now for six months or so but prior to labor day, it was a very good and one of the main sources of secured financing for our industry. So, all that stuff is coming together well, and at this point I believe we would do something below 8% and we're going to actually work towards improving what we could do today in terms of rate and we think we will do that later on this year.
Dave Coleman - RBC Capital Markets: Just going back to the number of signed leases, it looks like it increased by just over 100 versus year-end '08, which is I think the lowest number of signed leases in any given quarter. Is that just seasonality or was there is work slower during the first quarter than anticipated?
Brendan Cavanagh: No, what actually had to do with just cleaning up our system and some churn from some small tenants but its really the top line, the growth ads were inline with what we've done over the last couple of years, it was really removal of some tenants that resulted in lower net increase.
Dave Coleman - RBC Capital Markets: Great, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you and next we will go to Mike McCormick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael McCormick - JPMorgan: Great, thanks guys. Couple things, just may be your thoughts on what's printed yesterday with the boost on limited subscribers, is there an opportunity you think maybe somewhat near-term to have Sprint re-up spending on the other network, and is that an opportunity for you guys and secondly, just a follow-up on the last question on the CMBS reified, any sense on what preference the former take to get that done?
Kurt Bagwell: The boost results were good. We have actually seen some money being spend little bit, not a one over state this because is not big numbers, but we have seen some spending by Sprint Nextel on the Idiom (ph) network and, Mike, clearly as the network continues to do well and the demand continues to increase, we think that will lead to an additional -- well need to lead to additional spending, I think Sprint is doing what they need to do in terms of managing their finances and they're pushing off CapEx, as long as they feel possible. But we do not give our 20 years in the business that at some point demand continues to improve, that will need to be some additional network investment. And, in terms of your question about the form of the financing, we wanted to do a secured financing and there are typically three markets that historically have been available for that, one is the high yield secured market which is the one that one of our peers just accessed. The other is the bank institutional loan market which has traditionally been one that our industry has been very active in, and the third is the CMBS market. We don't hold out a lot of hope that the CMBS market will be the one we choose but we do have the architecture in place and if it does recover, it makes sense to do so, we would be quick and ready to go out there. So, other than being focused on a secured financing, we're going to continue to monitor and probably decide closer to the end exactly which of those markets we will tap.
Michael McCormick - JPMorgan: Great, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Jeffrey Stoops: Hey Ric.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Its been here all ten years I think, so nice to reflect back on those cycles. Three questions for you, maybe in reverse order of what your three points were. First, Jeff can you talk to us a little bit about what you feel the organic growth rate is in this industry, not just this year but as you look out kind of medium term. What do you think tower revenue, tower cash flow, EBITDA, even going into equity free cash or what do you think this industry can sustain given what you're seeing in the macro environment?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, I think 9 to 10% top-line. I think 12 to 14% tower cash flow line and high teens on the EBITDA line. I'm a little hesitant Rick with the equity free cash flow because obviously the biggest driver there, once you leave EBITDA is interest expense but its moving in the direction where it should be north to 20% growth, and the interest rate is moving positively so that we do feel confident that overtime it settles in north of 20 as long as the things we just talked about above that revenue, tower cash flow and EBITDA come in where we think.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: And do you think there is any systemic difference or portfolio difference that would cause your numbers to be higher lower than your public peers?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, I do think the difference in our portfolio helps us quite a but there, having built the majority of our towers or bought from people like us who build the towers for this industry. I think we have some inherent operating expense benefits and multi-tenant capacity benefits that should really help sustain those numbers. I think it has been apparent over the years, I think its really apparent on the point that Kurt and Brendan made earlier about the low augmentation CapEx per tower. As we've always said and one of the things that has been consistence about SBA over the 10 year history of being in tower ownership is, we are very careful about the quality of our portfolio, we like what we have a lot, and we think it has served us well and we'll continue to do so.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: And second point on the portfolio growth. Can you update us a little but about what you are seeing in the multiples as far as on tower cash flow and then also as you look at using stock versus cash, how you kind of do that math?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, what we're seeing on an apples to apples-to-apples basis compared to a year ago, as probably two to three turns lower in terms of cost. The batch of towers that we bought this year, I think it was nine or -- was it nine or ten?
Brendan Cavanagh: So far ten
Jeffrey Stoops: Ten. We actually were slightly more mature towers. They were around three tenants per tower and we bought those for about 10.5 times. The batch that we have under contract is less mature actually than our existing portfolio. So about 1.5 tenants per tower and we are looking at about 15.5 times tower cash flow multiple on that and both of those Ric, if you dial back a year ago, those multiples are probably two to three times below where similar assets would have been. And in terms of the use of -- I mean we take opportunities to bring stock back in which is what we did in the converts. We actually really managed to a balance of the equity and debt capitalization. So we use some stock and we'll turn also right around and use some cash but in general while we are above seven in terms of leverage, I think you can assume that we will continue to use some stock if presented with good acquisition opportunities that will meet our long-term return on investment criteria.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Okay. And the final question is on the balance sheet then, as you look at using the proceeds from the recent convert, I think your phrase was a substantial repayment or repurchase on the debt, how should we think about that, are there any prepayment penalties, how do you think about leading cash on the balance sheet versus paying it off? And on the CMBS, does that come up, what are the prepayment penalty windows there? Is it six months in advance or you don't have any prepayment penalties?
Jeffrey Stoops: Last question first. Its nine months for us. On the 2005 CMBS, we are free to prepay without penalty starting in February of '010. In terms of leaving cash on the balance sheet, it's not interest efficient to do that. We are going to see how we do. I would say over the next quarter or so in terms of our ability and success in repurchasing, our debt in the market. If we don't have much success there, we will probably take a big chunk of our cash and use this to pay down the SBA credit facility. The reason we would chose that one is that it is re-drawable overtime if we need it for our portfolio growth. And we would typically just use that to manage interest rate. And if we don't need to be sitting on $500 million of cash certainly given that the low cash needs with the business generates on a day-to-day basis. But we are hoping to replicate some of our prior successors with buying that as a discount although obviously it's not going to be the discounts that we generated back in the October November timeframe.
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Sure, thanks. Good luck guys.
Jeffrey Stoops: Thanks
Operator: Thank you and next we will go to the line of Brett Feldman with Barclays Capital.
Brett Feldman - Barclays Capital: Thanks for taking the question, you written some new recent reports that operating expense of your large customer is considering outsourcing the management network. I think that has opened up some questions about what that exactly means for vendors such as tower operators. I know you don't exactly what an agreement could look like. But, I'm just curious m would it be possible on your outsourcing deals for that vendor to assume control over the leases and potentially go back and renegotiate since one their mandates would be to save money?
Kurt Bagwell: Hey, Bret, this is Kurt, we all been saving that so you're hearing about it, I think its really from my understanding of it's really there current outsourcing program as a relate to and then possibly that vendor can grab another carrier there are some true efficiencies in the point as resources. So we don't worry about it all from the tower side, our leases are exclusive real estate that can't be replicated and when -- if that carrier is in better financial position to deploy more capital, the natural network needs, this middleman vendor obviously in-charge of getting that deployed. So we don't really see that's big issue for us at all.
Jeffrey Stoops: We had an obviously been in the middle of the specifics but I believe its really about people more than anything lease I don't think and outsourcing deal changes the fundamental characteristics of whether spread will need more of nor do I think that should they move to outsourcing that it will change the party with whom micro-machining contract with for tower space, I think it will continue to be Sprint. So, we really don't see it as affecting our business, certainly in a diverse way and we will help that as some true savings there would find its way back into network expansion.
Brett Feldman - Barclays Capital: What about the site services side, I mean it had historically been a pretty big customer of yours and if they were working with an outsourcing vendor, could that potentially changing the amount of demand you would see?
Jeffrey Stoops: Not on the tower leasing side, that demand is driven by what they need to do with their network, no matter who comes through. On our services business, we work directly for the carriers today; we also work directly for all of these middle man and program management firm. So, obviously, it might be different to we who are contracted with but we work for a lot of different -- today.
Kurt Bagwell: Erickson doesn't perform services, they manage it. So what they will do is they will then setup a system there will be a program manager and they will continue to hire firms like ours we suspect. And much the same way that we've done business with Vector (ph) for example doing bunch work for AT&T, general dynamics they fill that kind of role Brett, as appose to being in guide to actually due to work which is what we do.
Brett Feldman - Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. Good morning. You touched briefly on 40 with them some comments. Perhaps you could be a little bit more -- provide a little bit more color about what you're expecting in the balance of the year from both Clearwire and potentially Verizon on the LTE side? And your comments where I think you said lease up in the second half could be greater perhaps than you'd expected before, perhaps you just comment a little bit on what you've seen so far this year and how that's translating into your conference in the second half. Thanks.
Kurt Bagwell: Simon, Clearwire and Verizon, I don't want to get into two very specific customer details obviously. We have both in pretty public, where they're taking there WiMAX and LTE programs. And we are seeing what they're saying and are doing, Clearwire is been deploying their older technology for years and they revamping some of those markets now and continuing on with what the Sprint's own people started in the other markets. That's very real and moving forward. And Verizon as they've stated, it started in several select markets and why these overlay work is they go out and -- 4G or 3G or any other overlay, its really -- they go up and do side assessments and bio assessments and come back to develop a specific game plan for each site of custom and then they go out and start creating -- the lease amendment work to happen, to modify their lease, to handle their installation and they're creating a set of site drawings to match the installation up to that lease. So -- yeah. Otherwise on the leasing in general, this year often we have a more seasonal first quarter which is a little lighter and those as we said in the backlog is already up quickly and we're talking to it's their block going on the economy, piece you know I think they've viewed that as -- they've got a lot of networks, it's up to do. They've got capacity issues; they've got performance issues. Their performance issues are seen or seem to a lot of just basic expansions into other areas. So, it's -- we've been fortunate that they continue to follow ahead and so it's been good and we expect it to be a little stronger in the second half.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah I would add on the Clearwire point side, Simon. They've been very active but so far at least from our observation, they're staying within the ten markets that they have publicly talked about and on the lease to upside, keep in mind that operationally we talk about leases signed up and then there is a typically one to two quarter lag from when it hits a report; that's a financial statements. So I think the increase in activity not only that we expect to see in the second half over first half and first half is been fine. Its actually been what we've budgeted and expected our first quarter rather that you will not only see that manifest itself by the end of the year particularly in the fourth quarter financials but as we move into 2010 as well.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you, couple of questions. Maybe just back to the sort of the range of opportunities here now that there is comfort around the balance sheet to think about strategic activity. As you look at the range of opportunities out there, whether its small tower acquisitions, maybe getting back to eventually mid-size tower acquisitions, land purchases et cetera. As we think about the correction here, is this whole market kind of correcting together or their parts that are really lagging would provide you with sort of an opportunity, their arbitrage, the timing of the recovery. And then maybe just quick question on just revisiting the leasing activity into the second half. Obviously the comments on positive. You look at the run rate size leasing revenue, where you are right now just annualize that -- that sort of implies what you're sure projecting is the low end of guidance. I'm just wondering, why leaves that type of low end out there, why not move that up at this time, -- what you say? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, we did move it up a little and we don't like to get too far ahead of our speeds. But I think that math is good and people should take comfort from the last ten years of history that site leasing revenue doesn't go backward sequentially. So, people should feel good about our ability to hit our leasing revenue guidance. In terms of the opportunity base Jason -- I don't know that towers versus new builds, acquisitions versus new builds -- whether there will be an arbitrage opportunity within any of the different things that we do, maybe the one example or the one exception there might be lands purchases where given the very singular nature of the people we're dealing with and the less financially substantial some of those sellers would be. That might lag a little bit and provide us some additional opportunity there, but just exactly -- I mean the market around towers is pretty sophisticated and there is some very, I think its two folks who see that operationally the growth in the tower cash flow side has remained steady. So, really they are just changing the bids and the answer is based on changes in interest rate, which as those continue to I mean its very rational how the market has behaved over the last year as interest rates have spiked up and access to capital has got more difficult, prices have dropped not withstanding the operational side of growth is the same and as the credit markets improve that will firm the bit up, I believe on towers. So I don't know that there would be as much of an arbitrage, our strategy has always been take what we believe is a lower cost of capital that we have compared to some of the folks we compete with. Take our ability to really efficiently integrate those towers and squeezes the most out of them that we can once we owned them and use the combination of those to grow the portfolio in a way that's very accretive to shareholder wealth.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Okay great. Thanks.
Operator: And next we will go to the line of Chris Larson with Piper Jaffray, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chris Larson - Piper Jaffray: Hi, sorry about that. I just wanted to circle back to the 4G comments you made earlier, and really there is -- get a sense for that type lease up you'll see whether its going to be a traditional augmentation like we saw on a 3G conversion. Whether there is something more to it, both on a Verizon, AT&T basis and also on the Clearwire; are we seeing a lot more new sites versus using existing sites. And then you mentioned you've got a number of or at least one acquisition lined up if you could talk about the interest in using stock versus cash flow acquisitions?
Kurt Bagwell: Chris, on the I guess I will serve with WiMAX and Clearwire that they will be working with some of the existing contacts or locations in amending those. We also believe they will be taking some new locations on sites even if it is going next around those just because of the current loading or the structural capability of the site flying poles out there and things like that there is certain physical limits. So, there will be a mix on that plus they will be taking we believe a lot of new sites without contracts on just because our plans and the frequencies they are going to be utilizing. So, that will be a mix bag on the LTE side, I guess you could get quite that somewhere to 3-G in terms of frequency inside of amendments. It obviously depends on their existing load on the structure today and what how much reserve state they signed up four years ago, when they signed up for that lease. In certain markets and certain sites they reserve with more space for the future than others. So, it's really a side-by-side equation and overall I think you can equate an LTE over way somewhat to a MCS 3-G over that.
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, I would add...I think we as an industry, we need to be careful and I would encourage the analyst community to be careful with the terminology. I think we're got run into potential confusion when we talk about new leases versus amendments with Clearwire and Verizon, I mean traditionally an amendment has been driven by legal issues as to whether what is being added falls with inside the existing terms and maturities of an existing lease. Most of what we signed up with Clearwire has not been an amendment it's been brand new standalone lease, not quite sure how that will play out yet with Verizon whether they will want to bring that LTE with inside some of the existing parameters of leases, the CDMA leases or whether they want it to spend totally on it's own in terms of maturity days and renewals. So, we need to all work together to be careful to make sure we're talking apples-to-apples there. In terms of the acquisitions, its not one acquisition as at 42 towers is probably five or six different little deals, and as we've mentioned earlier, we'll still use some stock while we're levered north of 7 times, but we'll also now probably use some more cash and really the only thing that has changed with our new financing and the statements that we are making today is prior to our financing, we really were not working to use much of any cash at all in growing the portfolio through tower acquisitions and now that's changed and we are willing to use some cash, now that we feel better about the balance sheet and our liquidity position.
Chris Larson - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. It's helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Gary Powell with Wachovia. Please go ahead.
Gary Powell - Wachovia Securities: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions, just have a few. So you guys mentioned going back to the target of going to portfolio by about 5 to 10% in 2010, and using cash to do that. How should we think about your target leverage going forward and then what next of tower construction versus acquisition would be involved in that 5 to 10% growth rate?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, I think as we said today Gary and this has been an evolving answer to that question and it will evolve again as we other capital markets develop but, I would say today that I think 6 to 7 turns of total leverage is appropriate, provided that couple of those turns can continue to be accessed in the unsecured market with five or less turns in the secured market. So that's kind of what we think today, that was a very different answer than you got in October and it maybe different; we may give you different answer six months from now. I'm sorry, your other point?
Gary Powell - Wachovia Securities: How should I think about the mix of construction versus acquisitions in terms of your overall tower portfolio growth?
Jeffrey Stoops: Well, the biggest variable has been and will continue to be acquisitions, our new builds have been not really constrained by capital but more by operational issues and we're going to do more this year, I don't know if we'll do much more than a 100. Our goal is 80 to 100. You might get a little bit more out of that in years to come but probably not materially more. So the big variable for us in terms of portfolio growth will continue to be acquisitions.
Gary Powell - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then just speaking on the acquisition side, would you consider looking outside the U.S for opportunities?
Jeffrey Stoops: Yeah, we will, overtime as we kind of think about our next ten years. I think we have to be open minded. It is a business plan that we think can be taken internationally, obviously we want to replicate to the greatest extent possible with the conditions and drivers that exist here in United States. We think there will be some opportunity, some places to do that. So we are open.
Gary Powell - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then just last question I have, looking into the remainder of the year, and going into 2010, what do you see as the biggest driver of leasing demand and do you see any carrier initiative or anything that can sort of be a swing factor in either direction?
Jeffrey Stoops: Actually I don't think you'll see material changes going forward, I think what the -- at this point in the year what the carriers, I have said publicly about what they want to accomplish the rest of the year will remain in place. I think without material change, I think we are going to have another very good year for lease up and this year we'll be a little more back-end loaded.
Gary Powell - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jeffries & Company, Inc.: Thanks. Actually my questions have been asked and answered.
Operator: Thank you. And we have one more question; David Barden from Banc of America. Please go ahead.
David Barden - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks guys for taking the question. Just to the wrap it up; I guess one, with respect to the kind of pending Verizon, Alltel merger divestures; is this -- are you seeing carriers who are kind of coming in and looking to map out potential integration or growth opportunities here? Bottom-line is, is this something that could be incremental to the growth profile when these deals are expected to close probably around the end of the year? And then last Pam, could you -- I know there's some method that involves fees and other things with respect to the net proceeds from the convert. All this is specific dollar value of the hedge that you've acquired for the purpose of just calculating effective interest rate? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stoops: On the Alltel Verizon thing David, it depends obviously on who ends up with what markets but if its anybody other than AT&T and even if it is AT&T, and whosever hands those assets and I think there is some more that needs to be done with respect to bringing 3G service and ultimately 4G service to those assets. A subset of that answer is, if they end up in new hands as some of the rumors would imply, that would obviously take away any type of decommissioning risk. So that would be our preferred outcome provided it goes to good healthy new player. Pam?
Pamela Kline: Dave to answer your question it was 61.6 million and if you amortized -- we look at that and amortized that over the life for the instrument of five and a half years and we compute an effective interest rate.
David Barden - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Perfect. All right guys thanks. Congrats.
Operator: Thank you. And there are no more questions please continue.
Jeffrey Stoops: Great, well we want to thank you everyone for joining us today, we're off to good start for the year. And we look forward to our next quarter's earnings call.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA fourth quarter results conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, with instructions being given at that time. (Operator Instructions). And as a reminder today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Capital Markets, Pam Kline. Please go ahead.
Pam Kline: Thank you for joining us this morning for SBA's fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kurt Bagwell, our Chief Operating Officer, and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I need to get the standard SEC disclosure out. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking including but not limited to any guidance for 2009 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings. Particularly those set forth in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and our quarterly reports on 10-Q which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, February 27, 2009, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com. Brendan would you comment on the fourth quarter results please.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yeah, thanks Pam. Good morning. As you saw from our press release last night, our fourth quarter financial results were excellent and we exceeded the mid-point or were above the high-end of our guidance for site leasing revenues, site development revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and equity free cash flow. Total revenues were $134.4 million up 23.4% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were a $111.9 million or 32.1% increase over the fourth quarter of 2007. This leasing revenue growth was driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Site leasing segment-operating profit was $85.1 million. Site leasing contributed 96.9% of our total segment operating process in the fourth quarter. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $85.9 million or 35.9% increase over the year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 78.2%, up 170 basis points over the year earlier period. Our services revenues were $22.5 million, compared to $24.2 million in the year earlier period or 6.9% decrease. Services segment operating profit was $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Services segment operating profit margins were 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to 12.5% in the year earlier period. Kurt, will discuss services in more detail shortly. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $13.3 million including non-cash compensation charges of $1.5 million and a one-time pension settlement expense of $600,000 related to the termination of the AAT pension plan. This compares to SG&A expense of a $11.9 million in the year earlier period. Including non-cash compensation charges of $1.4 million. Other expenses for the fourth quarter included in other than temporary impairment charge of $7.8 million related to certain auction rate securities, we held at December 31, 2008. Those securities have now been written down to less than $1 million. Net income during the fourth quarter was $2.7 million, compared to a net loss of $28.9 million in the year earlier period. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 includes a $32 million gain on the early extinguishment of our debt, net of the right off of deferred financing fees. Net income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.02, compared to a net loss per share of $0.27 in the year earlier period. Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were a $116.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $77.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 or 37.8% increase over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 58.4% up from 52.5% in the year earlier period. Once again equity free cash flow increased materially in the quarter reflecting strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Equity free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $47 million, a 41.5% increase over the year earlier period. Equity free cash flow per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $0.40 or a 29% increase over the year earlier period. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 350 towers and 5 distributed antenna systems or DAS networks. We also built 25 towers and completed construction on one additional DAS network and ended the quarter with 7,854 towers owned and the rights to manage approximately 4,200 additional communication sites. Total cash capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $251.5 million consisting of $1.6 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures, such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $249.9 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx includes $242.1 million incurred in connection with acquisitions and earn outs. $6 million in new tower construction and $1.8 million for augmentations in tower upgrades. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $7.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. As of year-end we own or control for more than 50 years the land underneath 26% of our towers. At this point I'll turn things over to Pam, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Pam Kline: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the fourth quarter with $1.49 billion of commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates outstanding, $138.1 million of the 0.375% convertible senior notes, $550 million of 1.875% convertible senior notes, $230.6 million outstanding on our $285 million senior credit facility, a $149 million principle balance outstanding on our Optasite credit facility, and a $117.6 million of cash, short-term investments, and short-term restricted cash resulting in net debt of $2.4 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased and privately negotiated open market transactions. $211.9 million of our 0.375% convertible note and $65.5 million of our CMBS notes for a $147.8 million in cash and $3.4 million shares of our Class A common stock. During the quarter, we issued 300,000 shares in connection with acquisitions and our share count at the year-end was a $117.5 million. The company's net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.9 times at December 31, 2008. Our net secured debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 5.7 times. Our auction rate securities are not included in our calculation of liquidity or net debt. As of quarter end 85% of our debt was fixed rate and the weighted average cash coupon on all of our debt was 4.3% per year. Our fourth quarter cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest was very strong 2.7 times. Subsequent to December 31, 2008 we have repurchased an additional $34 million of our 0.375% convertible senior notes and $7.6 million of our CMBS notes for $25.3 million in cash and approximately 600,000 shares of our common stock. As of today, we have a $104.2 million of our 0.375% convertible senior notes outstanding and $1.48 billion of CMBS notes outstanding. I will now turn it over to Kurt to discuss some of our operational results.
Kurt L. Bagwell: Thanks Pam and good morning. We are pleased to have finished 2008 with such a strong fourth quarter. We said on our last call that Q4 should be similar to Q3, which was a very good quarter, but Q4 turned out to be even more robust than originally anticipated. As Brendan outlined, we preformed well in all aspects of our business as our customers remain busy. We enjoyed our highest ever organically sub-quarter in terms of dollars added with high volume contributions from both new tenant leases and amendments to existing leases. We bought and built a lot of high quality towers, we had a good service this quarter and we completed a new boss scenario DAS network on time and on budget. Specifically, for our fourth quarter results our gross tower leasing revenues signed in the quarter was very good on both the gross and a per tower basis. Activity was highest from T-Mobile and AT&T as they expand into new locations and also continued with their 3G UMTS overlays. Other leasing activity was diversified amongst Verizon, Metro, Leap and other regional carriers along with activity from other private and governmental entities deploying specialty systems. We are also seeing the early stages of other deployments from recent spectrum winners as well as beginning some of the clear wire ramp up. 79% of our new revenues signed came from new tenant leases about 21% came from amendments to existing leases, which as we've said before we feel is a very healthy mix. For the quarter, year-over-year same tower cash revenue growth and same tower cash flow growth was 10% and 13% respectively. Rental rates of state farm and our average cash basis rents across all of our 19,344 tenants at quarter-end increased to $1,886 per month. We bought 350 towers in the quarter including the culmination of our light tower deal on October 20. We've built another 25 towers during the quarter and finished the year having built a total of 85 approximately 40% more than each of the previous two years. We have a strong backlog of good new built prospects and we are confident that we will build at least as many towers in 2009 as we did in 2008. Our structural augmentation CapEx remains very well on a per tower basis and our teams are very focused right now on refining our operating expenses after a big year of asset growth. We feel very confident in our ability to increase our tower casual margins through optimization of utilities, repairs, and maintenance costs on a tower-by-tower basis, while continuing to provide the highest quality leasing service in the industry. The services side of our business had their best quarter of year in Q4 achieving substantially higher revenues and profits than in any of the three previous quarters. The driving factors in the much improved services quarter were our success in diversifying our backlog after Sprint's pullback in early 2008, and the traditional year-end push by several carriers to hit their target. We expect a steadier 2009 in this line of business, although it does remain very competitive. Overall, we feel very good about meeting our goals for 2009. The forecast for total carrier deployments are flat to up from 2008. We finished 2008 with a big quarter, which will help define 2009 and a continued evolution in total growth of wireless, especially wireless data gives us confidence that the tower business is a great segment of the wireless industry to be in right now and for the future. With that I will now turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Thanks, Kurt and good morning everyone. As you have heard and can see in our numbers the fourth quarter was another strong quarter for us. I am going to spend the first part of my comments on our operational performance. Operationally, we had a great year and we believe our future continues to look very bright. I will finish with some comments on the credit markets on our refinancing plans. Operationally, our backlog remains solid, our first quarter lease-up is on plan and all of the other data points we see indicate that leasing demand will stay strong through 2009 and beyond. The macro environment for wireless remains very favorable. Our wireless customers have reported their fourth quarter results and they were generally very strong. Wireless minutes of use are up, wireless data uses up even more and carriers are seeing improved economics from data use. Wireless minutes of use are displacing wireline minutes. Even though times are tough, wireless results in the current economy certainly argue that wireless has become a staple; and no longer a discretionary or luxury item. Because of the favorable demand drivers, our customers continue to make significant additional investment in their networks. We believe our customers have just begun to enjoy the growth that will be come from mobile wireless data services. The amount of investment dollars flowing into the development of content and applications for mobile data services already large growing fast then expected to drive material additional demand by consumers for 3G and 4G services. The two positive developments in the 4G area have occurred since our last call. Clearwire has begun to build-out its networks and Verizon has announced an accelerated build-out schedule for LTE with activity commenting as early this year. New market entrants such as Leap, Metro, Cox and a few smaller players have announced plans for significant network investment over the next couple of years. We believe the new federal stimulus legislation will also provide us with some additional opportunities for growth that we might not otherwise have had. All of this adds up to a very favorable demand environment for SBA for the foreseeable future notwithstanding what we know will be tough economic times in general. We continue to believe that lease-up on a revenue added per tower basis will be as good or better in 2009 as it was in 2008. Operationally, we continue to execute very well. Our team put up great results last year, we grew our portfolio 26% without increasing year-over-year leverage. All the acquisitions we did last year are fully integrated and performing well. We have entered the DAS business and already have some growth to show for it. We led the industry by a wide margin in leasing growth, adjusted EBITDA growth, equity free cash growth, and equity free cash per share growth. We materially expanded our tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins and our SG&A as a percentage of revenue continue to decline. With this type of operational performance in our business model we are very well positioned to weather a rough economy and still produce materially increasing cash flows in 2009 and beyond. As you could see from our 2009 outlook, we are projecting materially higher and for us record amounts of equity free cash flow next year. We will see a full year of results from the towers we acquired in 2008 and we expect organic leasing growth to once again be strong. The amount of CapEx we spend on augmentations and maintenance is a fraction of what our peer spent on per tower basis. With reduced plans for discretionary cash capital spending and materially higher adjusted EBITDA, we expect to reduce leverage materially by the end of 2009. Our outlook implies we will end 2009 with net debt to quarterly annualized adjusted EBITDA in the mid-6 times range. That puts us in excellent shape for our 2010 and 2011 refinancing obligations. Operationally, we ended the year strong and as a substantial company capable of and well positioned for additional growth. I expect this to continue to excel operationally. Now let's talk about what has been happening in the credit markets. The fourth quarter of last year was the time, when the perception by many was that no credit was ever going to be available again. For a company like SBA that uses leverage to enhance shareholder returns it was a difficult environment. Our great operational performance was not enough to offset concerns over whether or not we could refinance at all level let alone what price. As a result, our stock price suffered and changes were necessary to maximize shareholder value. We understood the need to change our priories and we did so quickly and clearly. In the fourth quarter, our priority was shifted to reducing leverage and refinancing risk rather than portfolio growth. While I am not happy about what happened to our stock price in the fourth quarter I am very proud of the speed and decisiveness with which we address the rapidly changing credit market situation. We immediately slowed our discretionary cash spending on assets, which you can see in our fourth quarter results as well as in our 2009 outlook. We will remain in the mode of materially reduced discretionary cash spending, pending refinancing some of our debt. In the fourth quarter, we seized on the opportunity to repurchase our debt at significant discounts and get ahead of our refinancing obligations. Since we never doubted the certainty of our future cash flows, we had the confidence to jump into the market and repurchase some of our debt at what we think were very favorable prices. Since October, we have retired $319 million of our 2010 convertible notes in our 2005 and 2006 CMBS debt in the aggregate for a $173 million in cash and 4 million shares of our stock. That equates to 17% of the original principle amounts of that debt, a net debt reduction of a $145 million at annual cash interest savings of $5.6 million, that's real value for our shareholders. We intend to continue to repurchase our 2010, 2011 maturities where we can do so at discounts, which we think are appropriate. In my opinion, the variability in our stock price continues to be all about the credit markets and our future cost of debt. Since December the high-yield in some other debt markets have improved some financings are getting done and we have seen our stock price recover somewhat. Many companies are dealing with both the credit crunch and with operational performance issues brought on by the tough economy. For SBA thankfully it's not about operations, our future operational prospects remain bright. For us, it's about credit and I believe shareholder appreciation for the foreseeable future will be dictated primarily by our success with refinancing and capital structure. Knowing that our top priority is to refinance our debt comfortably ahead of our maturity dates on the best terms possible and I am very confident about our prospects. On our last call, we discussed plans around refinancing. We provided detail plans then, which remain the same and we can review with any of you if you would like off-line. We have lot of flexibility given the fact that we have separated our assets for financing proposes into several different structures, which can be financed together or separately. We have multiple paths we can take to comfortably refinance our 2010 and 2011 maturities. We will be opportunistic as we have always been in the capital markets. Since the beginning of this year, we have been inundated with financing proposals to access multiple credit markets. We are ready to take advantage of the right opportunity, but we also want to continue to be thoughtful and patient. In just the last two months rents have tighten considerably and we would pay materially less to finance today then would have been the case in early January. While I don't want to get too far ahead of myself I do believe in today's market that we could refinance an all in fixed rates below 10% and that we will successfully refinance our CMBS ahead of the anticipated repayment dates and avoid any cash trap or step-up in interest rate. The market is becoming more differentiating and is disproportionally rewarding those companies that can provide predictable results and a certain future. SBA is one of those companies and we believe our current and future performance will continue to positively differentiate us with financing sources. Having said all of that however we do not intend to wait too long and it is our goal to get a material financing or financings done in 2009. That results have not only removed any lingering concerns about refinancing costs, but just as importantly would provide us with additional growth capital. We are committed to resume material portfolio growth at the appropriate time given our historical success and our operational optimism for future. We see and we believe we will continue to see a number of opportunities for investment that we believe will produce excellent returns for our shareholders even if our future debt costs are up a little bit. We are very good at acquiring and integrating towers into our portfolio. Our towers have performed very well and we have produced material shareholder value with our growth activities. We believe we will do the same in the future. We expect our operational performance to remain sharp and we are confident we can resume material portfolio growth on short notice if presented with the right opportunities. We are very excited about our future. As always I want to close by thanking our employees and customers. We accomplished a lot in 2008 and we expect to do the same in 2009. We have a great business that performs well in both good economies and bad and we look forward to reporting future results. Cary at this time we will open it up for questions.
Operator: All right. Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: Yes. I am interested in investments this year with respect to may be tuck-in acquisitions I assume that's not a priority for you relative to other years, but also the DAS activity that you referenced in the fourth quarter, organic growth versus perhaps buying other systems, what are your thoughts around that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Until we accomplish some refinancing Jonathan we are going to be very tight on discretionary cash spending as we have outlined in our outlook. We would focus primarily on organic new tower builds, and new DAS networks, and at this point, we really have not guided to any cash acquisitions of either towers or new DAS networks, but we are still interested within the outlook we've given for the reduced cash expenditures of growing both through new builds and new DAS networks, and we think we will be able to do that to some degree.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: And in each case with the organic growth are you pretty much looking for two tenants from the get-go or one tenant committed with very clear visibility towards the second tenant, what’s you're discipline on that?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: The latter. It's been our experience that to, we get much better results and much better use of our capital if we can get out there with one solid tenant and a clear path to see the second, and we have been very pleased with how that's played out overtime and that’s what we would continue to do.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: And then on the M&A front perhaps involving smaller companies, are you seeing or expecting that there might be private-to-private transactions or perhaps transactions involving carrier build towers?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well, we are even though we are not in a cash market today, we are looking at everything and watching and there has been a few things that have occurred, there is not been much I mean we really haven’t missed out certainly on anything material and don’t think we will, but I do think there will be a steady stream of opportunities in that area and that’s one of the reasons why we want to move forward and refinance the company on the right terms and get us back to really the growth path that we have been on over the years. And I think we will, I don’t know if it will be early in '09 or late or when exactly, but there are opportunities out there and I think they are going to be good ones, I think that we are starting to see some seller price expectations come down in light of the market and we are pretty confident that there is going to be opportunities out there that will produce very, very good shareholder returns for us over time.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: And then with respect to ground purchases or ground lease extensions, are seller price expectations coming in a bit or….
Jeffrey A. Stoops: They are. We've actually ratcheted down what we are prepared to pay, and we are in the process of sorting that out with sellers, some are saying, no thanks that's not what you were prepared to offer me last year and we’re saying fine that's all we are going to offer you this year and we are doing okay there. It's a process of adjusting seller expectations but it is happening.
Jonathan Atkin – RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Prentis of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Richard Prentis – Raymond James: Thanks. Good mornings guys.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Hi, Rick.
Richard Prentis – Raymond James: Hey. Jeff I want to follow-up a little bit on the capital markets items that you and Pam were talking about. As you look at your ability to buy some of your existing debt in the marketplace out there, talk to us a little bit about what you are seeing as January came into February as far as what they are trading as far as any discounts versus par, how the flow of sellers approaching you versus you finding them has kind of played out?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It's actually over the last couple of months it’s been fascinating because in the kind of the peak of the October, November pressure on the hedge funds, particularly the convertible arbitrage hedge funds, that's when we're getting calls, daily and multiple calls daily from those holders looking to sell their coverts back to us. That has ebbed a little bit, that pressure seems to be off those particular investors, maybe the selling is all done or they don't have anything left to sell, I am not quite sure which. But as the debt markets reopened Rick there was a kind of a steady improvement in price which means the best discounts, we captured we're in the probably November timeframe maybe early December and since then the discounts have been shrinking a little bit as the credit markets have improved and people are biding up in general debt instruments. I think we'll still capture discounts to par I'm not holding out hope that we will capture the same discounts that we got in November.
Richard Prentis – Raymond James: Probably actually it's a good indicator that the rates you might be able to get in taking out new debt should be coming down as well then?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well it is, I mean we've got our best deals on the converts when our stock was at $9 a share. I'm not really looking forward to that. So, that's absolutely right. I mean it's, what we took advantage of was the silver lining, but it was really a silver lining in a very cloudy environment and I'm just as happy to have all of our debt prices recover, because it's exactly as you say it means that capital will be flowing and available to us at better prices.
Richard Prentis – Raymond James: As you look at your options you mentioned multiple financing proposals all kind of different type of structures. Can you let us know just kind of what some of those different varied structures have been, how senior or junior on the balance sheet might they be and I guess another question associated that was how much cash do you want to keep on your balance sheet?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: The structures are literally all over the board. They could be at the holdco level. They could be at an interim level between the companies that own the towers and our holding company or they could be at the asset ownership level. So, we have at least three different types of levels that which we can offer that and we have a variety of markets. We haven't been in the high yield market in a couple of years, but we are watching things there, obviously we have been in the convert market. There is some possibility although, I wouldn't run out and get too excited about this just yet, there maybe additional securitized debt available at least at the AAA level maybe down to the AA levels. So, we are watching everything and anything and looking to make the best decisions for us over the long term, I mean the one thing I’d tell you, we are pretty careful about and why we haven’t rushed in so far although we could have, whatever we do we are going to be looking for an instrument of at least five years or longer, maybe much longer and we are going to be living with that for a while. So, we want to make sure we do the right thing.
Richard Prentis – Raymond James: And as far as cash on the balance sheet what do you thing the right kind of run the business levels are?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well to run the business without any material additional cash expenditures beyond your equity free cash flow, 50 million. I mean if you go back over time, the cash needs in the business other than for discretionary spending are really low, I’m sure we could do it with less than 50, but I don’t think we would.
Richard Prentis – Raymond James: Great. Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. Good morning. I wanted to followup on a couple of things you said on the call. I think you said that your CapEx on augmentation and maintenance was lower than your peers. I just wanted to understand a little bit more about what's driving that and how are you able to get better advantage and then you talked about the new build activity. If we could get some more color on that is that people building out new footprint, the Cox’s of the world, or is that a consequence of 3G that you are requiring more density in sell sides for existing carriers perhaps a little more color around what the kind of things driving the new build that would be great? Thanks.
Brendan T. Cavanagh: Yeah. I will take the first and then I will let Kurt take the second Simon. The difference between our portfolio and how it translates into much lower augmentation and maintenance CapEx all stems from the fact that our towers were either build by us or build by others like us and a very small percentage of our towers were originally built by carriers for their own network needs. And there is just a lot of differences that go with that distinction including, original structural capacities the age of the towers, we just have the newer more robust physical plant that allows us to take on a lot of additional tenant growth with very little additional capital required, and it all stems from who originated the assets, and how they were originated and for what original purpose. Kurt?
Kurt L. Bagwell: Simon. On the new builds, its most of our anchor tenants are from the big four, we do some with the other regional carriers and some with the new carriers as well, but it's not really skewed towards the newer carriers, and it's, if we do them for the new carriers its not in a situation where the tower next door is full because it obviously doesn’t lead us to a tower with future growth prospects. So, we only we have been very selective with these and they are only in locations, we see that a path of two, three, four tenants over a couple of year time period. Some of the deals are structured as a build-to-suit deal or it’s a more official deal with the carrier and some are what we call strategic sites where we may have location in several tenants are interested initially, and the sites are a mix of I would say suburban and highway, in the small town sites, it’s a little bit of everything that we have got going on. But its been nice, we spent about five years rebuilding this program, and we have got the backlog up to a good point, we have been able to be selective, and we are hitting some good volumes now, but its all good quality sites that are leasing up well. So, we are pretty happy with it.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: And is lot of this driven by the need to really get a better 3G signal into some of those places?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yeah. That's some of it and some of it is just signal growth out on the edges of their network, or filling in holes in the middle, it’s a little bit of everything, but its definitely not just 3G.
Simon Flannery – Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike McCormack of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Is your phone on mute? Well, we'll move along to the line of Jonathan Schildkraut of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Jefferies & Company: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two here, in terms of the large acquisitions that you did at the end of last year, could you remind us if there were any kind of cash earn out provisions that we should be looking at. And secondly, if I have it correctly I think there was a bit over a $100 million left in a facility that you guys could use for acquisitions and I just wanted to get that right number as well as get a sense as to when that facility closes? Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yeah. No earn outs on our three big deals. And on the facility, Jonathan, we actually had a $100 million left, but when Lehman went bankrupt we lost $50 million of that so we have about $50-$55 million left on that facility, which we could use for acquisitions I mean we are not that's not really in our plan even though we have the liquidity because it would be counter to our current goal of reducing leverage heading into refinancing, but that facility matures in November of 2010.
Jonathan Schildkraut – Jefferies & Company: Great. Now, I understand and you have laid out fairly clearly what your priorities are in terms of cash flows, but just trying to give a sense as to what the dry powder is if the overall environment improves and some of your priorities change? Thank you again.
Operator: All right. Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from Gray Powell from Wachovia. Please go ahead.
Gray Powell – Wachovia Capital Markets: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a few quick ones here. Just in terms of the demand, do you think that demand in 2009 is more back-end loaded or spread out evenly throughout the year, and do you expect growth to be driven more by augmentations or new tenants?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Kurt?
Kurt L. Bagwell: Gray, I think what you've heard from the other guys is similar to what we are seeing probably a 40, 60 years nothing too severe on the back-end loading. So, that's pretty consistent. I don’t expect our augmentation mix to change a whole lot. We've been running, I think as high as 70:30 and as slowest 80:20. I would expect it to probably balance somewhere between there all the year. The augmentations are nice, but we love new leases too. So, I don’t really see a huge mix change there.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: A lot of the devils in the details with that question Gray and the Clearwire is that a new lease, or is that an amendment to an existing Sprint lease. I mean there will be some of both Verizon, LTE, if they begin to do business this year is that a brand new tenancy because it probably will be a brand new lease and not folded into an existing lease. I mean we haven’t yet kind of fully baked the answers to all those, because we haven’t seen exactly the facts that we will be addressing. But the answers to some of those questions will shape the numbers as we go forward. I’m not sure it matters a whole lot because it's all good revenue, but it will make a difference.
Gray Powell – Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. That makes sense. Then just how should we think about the lease rates on the towers that you acquired in 2008 versus SBAC's core portfolio, are you seeing any difference in demand there in 2009?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: No, it seems to be our demand is fairly even across the portfolio.
Gray Powell – Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay, great. And then just last question, this one I have to admit this one might be tough to answer, but you've mentioned that if you were to refinance today, you could get rates below 10%, if you were to refinance debt in current conditions, but leverage were closer to say 6.5 or 6 times net debt-to-EBITDA, can you ballpark what the rate would be, or at least kind of quantify what the benefit of delevering by another turn, turn and half would be?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well I don't want to answer that question because the answer will be lower, if you go back to an earlier question as to what point you structure your debt add in our overall corporate structure, if we issue additional secure debt that will be cheaper than what we could issue say in unsecured high yield deal at the holding company level. So, and that's why we're taking our time to work through this because there will be real interest rate differences depending on where we structure that facility, and it's possible even in today's market that a secured deal could come below 8%.
Gray Powell – Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay fair enough. That's good to know. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question goes to Rick Prentiss of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: Hey guys I think everybody is tired after yesterday, but I had a few followups. Jeff, you mentioned Clearwire, previous calls you had thought Clearwire might be I think about $1.5 million worth of revenue to you guys this year, now if they are funded and you're still thinking 1.5 could it be a little bit bigger just kind of what are you thinking on Clearwire?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: It's probably the same.
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: Okay. And then with your services businesses going pretty well, do you have any insight into LTE as far as what's going to be involved with an LTE build out, we keep getting mixed signals on exactly how much equipment and what size of the equipment might come in, any insight on LTE what it might mean?
Kurt L. Bagwell: Rick this is Kurt. Nothing definitive just yet, but I mean I don't see this being incredibly different than UMTS overlay. I means it's a technology, it’s a different frequency, and you hear reports of bigger antennas, which with the frequency should generally be true. I think they will obviously try to take as much advantage of their existing leases as they can, but those are limited depending on what how much they lease for in the past, and they are trying to do a lot of different things out there with 800 megahertz, 1900, now 700 in 3G and 4G technology. So, I don’t foresee it really being a whole lot different, and we will try to work with them where we can, and in some cases are going to need to acquire some more space. So, I think it is substantially different then, when Sprint and Verizon went to Rev A, EV-DO in Rev A that was more unseen for us, but this a new technology.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: And it's clearly going to require new equipment, but I mean the bottom line answer here Rick is it's still not to the stage yet where we've actually gotten the specific specs for us to react to.
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: And then trials will take a while and before I guess real revenue effect as far as scale is probably really '010 or '11 probably?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yes.
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: Okay. And then the final question, kind of lost in the American Towers called the other day they talked about generators. Spending some CapEx on generators, update us on a little bit on what you are seeing as far as demand for generators, kind of that commitment to keeping cell sites on air and also microwave back haul, are you starting to see some of that accelerate on your sites?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yeah. I mean we see all those things and they have all been sources of incremental positive revenue for us, we had a couple of years back we trialed our own program of kind of going out and buying generators and holding them out to the carriers, and that didn't work that well. Probably because we did it in Ohio maybe it wasn’t that smart, but even if you do it in the costal areas. Really it's hard to get an existing carrier to kind of buy into that if they're not of their own initiatives. So, what we've done is we just hold ourselves open to facilitate they are putting generators on the property and in some cases we have multiple generators that are paid for and incremental lease revenue added for the additional footprint in various sites. So, we have generally tried to stay away from getting into equipment provisioning where there could be obsolescence. And we're happy with the way it's going for us maybe we're getting a lot of added generator revenue, but we're not actually buying and maintaining the generators and holding it out there for people to tie into. There have been some recent changes in the whole backup power situation I don't think carriers are under the same regulatory pressure they were I think those regulations got struck down, but carriers are still interested in the topic they don't want the adverse publicity of downtime in the event of storms and things like that. So, I think we'll continue to see incremental revenue from that source for years to come. And we're starting to see incrementally more on a year-over-year basis revenue from wireless back haul, but it's still tiny in comparison to just adding basic antennas for carriers looking for better capacity.
Richard Prentiss – Raymond James: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And we go to the line of Mike McCormack of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Manish Jain – JPMorgan: Yeah. Hi, this is Manish Jain for Mike McCormack. How are you guys doing?
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Good Manish. How are you?
Manish Jain – JPMorgan: Doing well. Just a couple of quick questions. One, you mentioned the 79 of leasing activities, 79% is from new leases and 21% from amendments, just wondering how are you expecting that ratio to play out throughout the year. And then regarding the broadband stimulus plan, just wondering if you guys think given the geographic positioning of your towers, you may have some advantage over your other tower peers in that respect?
Kurt L. Bagwell: Manish this is Kurt. On the leases versus amendments again we expect that's spread to say fairly similar probably between 20% and 30% from amendments, which is fine I don't expect it really to go lower because there is a lot of augmentation activity out there, but we are also seeing a lot of new leases come in. So, I think the 20% to 30% range is kind of consistent again. On the potential stimulus spending out there, there have been specific references to tower companies being eligible for some of the money. The money will be coming through the Department of Agriculture RES funding, which has been an existing program for years and it will get some increased funding. And they have a good set of processes in place to receive that and then some of it will be coming through NTIA, which those processes are yet to be defined. We've had thoughts of, if we have some access to some low priced money, we've already reached out and started to chat with some of the carriers if they could also access some of that for their equipment, what it makes sense in some of these outer areas, it doesn't model out to build sites, which we may not otherwise build, that's a possibility. Obviously, with our existing portfolio, I don’t think it really, I guess it could help if the carriers can get some of that funding for their equipment purchases, we may see some incremental lease-up in those areas.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Yeah I’d we look at it as a incremental positive Manish, but it hasn’t caused us to rethink our outlook or materially change our views about the future.
Manish Jain – JPMorgan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have no more questions in queue. Please continue.
Jeffrey A. Stoops: Well we appreciate everybody joining us today as we kind of wrap up our 2008 results and we look forward to our first 2009 report, which I guess will be sometime in early May. Thanks.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). Just to remind you, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Pam Kline, Vice President of Capital Markets
Pam Kline: Thank you for joining us this morning for SBA's third quarter 2008 Earnings Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kurt Bagwell, our Chief Operating Officer, and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I need to get the standard SEC disclosure out. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking including but not limited to any guidance for 2009 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings. Particularly, those set forth on our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and our quarterly reports on 10-Q which documents are publicly available. These factors and others [have affected] historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we may make. Our statements are as of today, October 31, 2008, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com. Brendan, would you comment on our third quarter results?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yes. Thank you, Pam. Good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release last night, our third quarter financial results were excellent and we exceeded the mid point or were above the high end of our guidance for site leasing revenues, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, and equity free cash flow. Total revenues were $118.7 million, up 15% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $105 million or 24% increase over the third quarter of 2007. Site leasing revenue included a onetime benefit of $0.8 million. This leasing revenue growth was driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Site leasing segment operating profit was $75.8 million. Site leasing contributed 98.9% of our total segment operating profit in the third quarter. Tower cash flow for the third quarter of 2008 was $76.6 million or 29.4% increase over the year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 77.7%, up 260 basis points over the year earlier period. Our services revenues were $18.2 million, compared to $22.2 million in the year earlier period or an 18.1% decrease. Services segment operating profit was $868,000 in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2007. Services segment operating profit margins were 4.8% in the third quarter of 2008, compared to 13.1% in the year earlier period. Kurt will discuss services in more detail shortly. SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $12.5 million including non-cash compensation charges of $1.6 million and a onetime severance expense of $0.9 million. This compares to SG&A expense of $11.3 million in the year earlier period including non-cash compensation charges of $1.5 million. Other expenses for the third quarter included another than temporary impairment charge of $0.5 million related to certain auction rate securities held at September 30, 2008. As discussed previously, the company still holds three auction rate securities with a par value of $29.8 million which had a fair value of $8.8 million and September 30, 2008. Net loss during the third quarter was $16.4 million, compared it a net loss of $17.5 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the third quarter was $0.15, compared to a net loss of $0.17 in the year earlier period. Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were $107.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $66.9 million in the third quarter of 2008 or a 26.7% increase over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 57.3%, up from 52.3% in the year earlier period. Once again, equity free cash flow increased materially in the quarter, reflecting strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Equity free cash flow for the third quarter of 2008 was $39.3 million, a 30.1% increase over the year earlier period. Equity free cash flow per share for the third quarter of 2008 was $0.37 or a 27.6% increase over the year earlier period. In the third quarter, we acquired 567 towers build 22 towers and end the quarter with 7,484 towers owned and the rights to manage approximately 4,300 additional communication sites. Total cash capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2008 were $45.9 million consisting of $2 million of non-discretionary cash capital expenditures such as tower maintenance and general corporate CapEx and $43.9 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures. Discretionary cash CapEx includes $31.3 million incurred in connection with acquisitions and earn-outs; $5.8 million in new tower construction and $2.1million for augmentations and tower upgrades. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent an aggregate of $5.4 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At this point, I'll turn things over to Pam, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.
Pam Kline: Thanks Brendan. SBA ended the third quarter with $1.555 billion of commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates outstanding, $350 million of 0.375% convertible senior notes, $550 million of 1.875% convertible senior notes, $225.4 million outstanding on our $285 million senior credit facility, $150 million principle balance outstanding on our Optasite credit facility, and $476.6 million of cash, short-term investments, and short-term restricted cash resulting in net debt of $2.4 billion. During the quarter, we issued 7.7 million shares in connection with acquisitions and our share count at the end of the quarter was 113.7 million. The company's net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 8.8 times at September 30, 2008. Our net secured debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 5.4 times. Our auction rate securities are not included in our calculation of liquidity or net debt. As of quarter end 87% of our debt was fixed rate and the weighted average cash coupon on all of our debt was 4.25% per year. Our third quarter cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest was very strong 2.7 times. Since the end of the quarter, we've used a portion of our substantial cash balances to close the Light Tower transaction and to repurchase debt. Since September 30, we've repurchased $83 million of our 0.375% convertible senior notes which were due in 2010 in privately negotiated transactions for $60.9 million in cash. Additionally, we exchanged 2.735 million shares of Class A common stock for 60.5 million of our 0.375 senior convertible notes. Based on the discounts, we were able to repurchase or exchange these notes at we achieved an average effective risk free yield to maturity of approximately 17%. As of today, we have $206.5 million of our 0.375% convertible senior notes outstanding. On a pro forma basis, for the debt exchanges and repurchases, and assuming the Optasite transaction closed as of July 1, 2008, our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.9 times at September 30. I will now turn it over to Kurt to discuss our operational results.
Kurt Bagwell: Thanks, Pam and good morning. As I was reviewing our results and putting together my notes for the call this morning, I realized yet again what a great business model we have. As you have seen in the numbers, our growth is strong and steady and the efficiencies provided for our scale are tremendous. Our customers continue to report strong results in terms of subscriber additions and usage growth for both voice and data. The quality value and inherent safety in utility of wireless services has become evermore clear in times where people are cutting back on almost all other spending. In regards to our third quarter results, our gross tower leasing revenues signed in the quarter was again very solid and we expect Q4 to be similar to Q3 based on our robust leasing backlog. We saw very strong activity from AT&T and T-Mobile both for new leases and for 3G UMTS amendments. The 3G overlay activity seems to be accelerating in both cases as the iPhone and other data device demand increases with the user base. We've also seen substantial leasing from [program security] called roaming over bills which is why they increased their footprint in areas where they are seeing the highest levels of roaming so they can increase their margins. For the quarter, year-over-year same-tower cash leasing revenue and same-tower cash flow growth was 10% and 14% respectively. Rental rates of state farm and our average cash basis rents across all of our 18,381 tenants is up over 4% in the past 12 months to $1,859. During the third quarter, 77% of our new revenue signed came from new tenant leases and 23% from amendments to existing installations. We like this percentage mix as it shows strong demand for new locations, as well as a healthy influx of additional revenue from our existing tenants. Wireless backhaul continues to gain momentum and we feel strongly that this trend is here to stay due to the tremendous needs of 3G and 4G technologies. We also expect that fiber backhaul will continue to grow dramatically at our sites and we welcome these providers to bring in the bandwidth to our clients need to maintain and grow their quality of service. Our new tower build team completed 22 towers during the quarter, putting us on schedule to meet our stated goal of at least 80 in the calendar year 2008. We have a strong and diverse backlog of new tower build sites in our pipeline. The leasing results on these sites have exceeded our expectations and the leased up results of the average site in our portfolio. We completed the Optasite transaction in Q3 bringing 528 towers and 38 managed sites into our portfolio. The transition went very smoothly and we are already signing new leases and amendments on these properties. The Light Tower transaction was completed on October 20 and those 340 towers and five managed sites have also been integrated into our systems and the tenant sales process commenced immediately. These two transactions in addition to our summertime tower co-transaction continue to demonstrate the scalability of the tower model as the resources added to handle these sites was minimal. On the operational side of our portfolio, both OpEx and CapEx continue to be predictable and within our plans. Maintenance CapEx for Q3, once again came in at an annualized rate of less than $1,000 per tower per year. As we have been preparing budgets for 2009, we've been able to once again maintain the same unit costs for all OpEx categories using scale and efficiency to our advantage. Lastly in the expense area, the percentage of our towers for which we own or control for more than 50 years the underlying land was up to 26% and we feel there is much more opportunity with the new towers we recently acquired to advance that percentage even further. Unlike on the leasing side, where we captured customer activity broadly, our services business continues to be more concentrated. Our third quarter services results show that, as we are not able to satisfactorily diversify our backlog after this brand activity slow down. Q3 services revenue was basically flat with Q2 at $18.1million, but profitability was down substantially. Q4 is expected to be better than either Q2 or Q3 and our outlook for 2009 is better than what we believe our full year 2008 will end up being, although the services business continues to be very competitive. We are committed to improving services and we continue to review our options for improvement with respect to that segment. As mentioned on our last call, in addition to picking up towers and managed sites from Light Tower this past week, we also picked up five existing data networks in New England, with one more in construction in the Back Bay area of Downtown Boston. We look forward to diving into this niche business and moving it forward in the most profitable way possible. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Kurt and good morning everyone. Let me start by welcoming Brendan Cavanagh, our new CFO to his first earnings call. The third quarter was another strong quarter for us for site leasing revenue continuing a trend that goes all the way back for us to the beginning of 2004. Our backlog remains solid and all of the other data points we see tell us that leasing demand will stay strong through 2009 and beyond. Our customers are in the middle of significant additional investment in their networks to be able to deliver and capture consumer demand for high quality 3G service across all of their service areas. The amount of investment dollars flowing into the development of content and applications for mobile data service is already large, growing fast, and expected to drive material additional demand by consumers for 3G and 4G service. 4G equipment and planned deployments are beginning to take shape and will be a source of new business for SBA for years to come with the first true provider, Clearwire, expected to become very active later this year or early in 2009. New market entrance Leap, Metro, and now Cox have plans for significant new network launches over the next couple of years. All of this adds up to a very favorable demand environment for SBA for the foreseeable future. While we are optimistic, we are also mindful of the difficult economic and capital markets conditions we now face and we'll likely continue to face well into 2009. We do believe wireless in general and towers in particular will do better in the current environment than most other businesses. This is the second opportunity for this management team to guide SBA through difficult economic times. Looking back to the last time, the downturn of 2001 to 2003, there are a number of important differences between then and now. Wireless is a much bigger business now for both the consumer and for our customers, the wireless service providers. For multi-business companies like AT&T and Verizon, wireless has become their most important business segment. In the earlier period, no one was sure whether wireless was a disposable luxury item or a staple. Wireless results in the current economy certainly argue that wireless has become a staple; not only because of its continued growth, but its growth against declines in wire line use. For those consumers who have to make a choice, they are making it and are choosing wireless over wire line. Looking back, wireless capital spending in the 2001 to 2003 period remained substantial. Our customers are much stronger today than five or six years ago with much greater cash flow and ability to invest in their networks. Our customers have all chosen a path that emphasizes smartphones and data use as a way to increase ARPU and reduce churn. This path requires some material level of continued network investment. Over the long term, unless our customers want to abandon their data initiatives and open themselves up to increased churn, we believe they must and will choose to continue to invest in their networks. As is the case with our customers, SBA is a much stronger company than we were five or six years ago. We are very well positioned to weather a rough economy and produce materially increasing cash flows in 2009 and beyond. As you can see from our 2009 outlook, we are projecting materially high and for us record amounts of equity free cash flow next year. We will see a full year of results from the towers we acquired this year and we expect organic leasing growth to once again be strong. The components of our equity free cash flow outlook for 2009 are very predictable and substantially fixed in nature. Substantially, all of our 2009 site leasing revenue was already booked and new leases or amendments really need to be signed by the end of June of 2009, to have any impact on 2009 financial results. Our operating expenses are stable and not very susceptible to material swings. 87% of our debt is fixed rate. Our need to spend maintenance CapEx to support our towers continues to be very small. We have no debt maturities in 2009 and with greatly reduced plans for discretionary spending and materially higher adjusted EBITDA we expect to reduce leverage materially by the end of 2009. Our outlook implies we will end 2009 with net debt to quarterly annualized adjusted EBITDA in the high sixes, and excluding our 2013 convertible notes, the ratio would be approximately 5.0 times at the end of 2009. That puts us at excellent shape for 2010 and 2011 refinancing obligations. I want to spend a few minutes on credit and refinancing since I believe concern over our refinancing is the primary reason why our stock is trading at such undervalued levels. Of the two main concerns driving markets lower, SBA is more impacted by credit concerns than it is by recession. On the credit side, government stimulus appears to be working, LIBOR is falling rapidly and we believe banks and others will resume lending to creditworthy borrowers well before the second half of 2010 when we have our first debt maturities. Towers with their predictable and growing cash flows have always been a preferred and more creditworthy borrower. Our banking relationships tell us they expect towers to once again lead the list of most desirable borrowers as we emerge from debt markets. We have multiple paths, we can take to comfortably refinance our 2010 and 2011 maturities, all paths can take advantage of the tremendous flexibility we have to separate and then combine our towers into multiple segments for financing purposes. Our recent debt repurchases improve all of the paths available to us as would additional repurchases of debt at a discount which we intend to do given the right opportunity. I'm going to outline one specific refinancing path, not because it is the one we will necessarily take, but because it is the most straightforward and easiest to understand. With cash on hand and projected equity free cash flow after discretionary spending between now and the second half of 2010, we can pay off all of our remaining 2010 convertible notes and our two credit facilities except for approximately $50 million to $100 million and less if we repurchase additional debt at a discount. At that time, we expect to have over 3,000 towers outside of our CMBS generating over $90 million in run rate adjusted EBITDA. If you add to that the 1,700 towers that supported our $405 million CMBS due on November 2010, which by then should be producing an additional of approximately $100 million of run rate adjusted EBITDA, we'll have 4,700 towers producing approximately $190 million of run rate adjusted EBITDA that we could use to obtain approximately $500 million or less of refinancing debt necessary in the second half of 2010. That's less than 3.0 turns of leverage against available assets, although we would target using no more than $125 million of our run rate EBITDA to obtain four or more turns of leverage and save the rest for 2011 where a similar approach has us equally comfortable about our 2011 refinancing obligations. We are very confident about our ability to obtain four turns of first lien secured leverage. With an expectation now of an extended period of low LIBOR even with higher than historical spreads, we believe our all in refinancing costs will be reasonable. You should also assume, we are prepared to move quickly to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance well ahead of the second half of 2010. Longer-term, we may find it appropriate to revise our target leverage range to five to seven turns to maximize shareholder value which will give us plenty of ability for future and additional growth. We will be finalizing our thinking on that topic as credit markets stabilize. With respect to future portfolio growth, we intend to resume additional acquisitions for cash at such time as we see sufficient improvement in the credit markets. In the interim, we may pursue some acquisitions for stock when we can do so on an immediately accretive basis and the acquisition otherwise meets our investment returns and criteria. I believe any acquisitions for stock however are likely to be relatively small in size. We continue to believe that acquisitions of high quality growth towers for the right price is an excellent way to increase shareholder value. Lease up and calculated returns on our historical acquisitions have been excellent and as we have said earlier, we believe the operating environment will continue to be favorable for the foreseeable future. We like the assets we purchased this year a lot, and we believe they have excellent growth prospects, which will shine through in 2009 as our results move through the year to become increasingly driven by organic growth as oppose to by portfolio growth. We remain plugged into the selling community, and as a result, we do not believe we will miss many opportunities as most of the sellers we have speak to have said they will wait for market conditions to improve. When we do decide to get materially active in acquisitions again, I'm confident we can do so very quickly. While we will not go into 2009 with our typical goal of 5% to 10% portfolio growth, we could still be there by year end with an improvement in the capital markets. With reduced leverage and increasing equity free cash flow, we will be well positioned for future growth. In the meantime, the 25% portfolio growth we will experience in 2008 is more than enough to keep us on our multi-year path of material portfolio growth, even if 2009 turns out to be a lower portfolio growth here. As always I want to close by thanking our employees and our customers. We have accomplished a lot so far this year. I'm confident their contributions will remain strong as we look to a very good finish to 2008 and a solid 2009. We have a great business that performs well in both good economies and bad and we look forward to reporting future results. And Paul, at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions). First question is from Clayton Moran, Stanford Group. Please go ahead.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Group: Good morning. I have just one question, but it's really separated into a few different parts. Around the 2009 guidance, if you could give us more insight into some of the assumptions on the items I'm looking for would be; what you're assuming in regards to churn, what it implies in regard to same tower growth, what you're assuming in regards to Clearwire, what's the scenario whereby you get to the bottom end of the site leasing revenue range? And then lastly, do you assume any contribution to EBITDA from the site development segment?
Jeff Stoops: So, that was one question, clay? Let me give that a shot. As we mentioned in the press release, we are looking at slightly higher in absolute dollar incremental revenue growth next year than we will experience in '08. And very roughly, that's because we do expect some contribution from Clearwire and Cox and basically we expect everything else on every other customer that we've had in '08 to be relatively similar in terms of activity in '09. That's roughly how we got there. The actual amount for Clearwire is not that great, because as you know, given the way our numbers work, you really have to have leases signed up by the middle of the year to impact the 2009 financial results. So, you're only going to really get a half year of activity operationally that will go into the 2009 results. And roughly, Clay, Clearwire is in there for about $1.5 million. Obviously, that will grow quite a bit in 2010 but because of the timing of the way things work operationally, that's the continue probation for '09. In terms of same-tower, it's on a cash basis, it's around 10%, although, you don't see that in the financials because we're starting to lose GAAP revenue based on the impact of the FAS 13, straight lining of revenue impact as mentioned in the press release. But other than that, we're really expecting a stable year as we move from '08 into '09 again with a little slight increase in the cash contribution from Clearwire and Cox, but it doesn’t really add a whole lot to the expected '09 times numbers and I think you'll see that a lot more in the '10 numbers.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Group: Okay. And churn is roughly steady at 1% or just over 1%?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah, I think we're between 1% and 1.5%, right Brendan?
Brendan Cavanagh: 1%.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Group: And the contribution from site development to EBITDA?
Jeff Stoops: Not much. We don't really kind of get into that level of detail. But after the allocation of SG&A, it will have a positive, we're projecting a positive contribution, but not a materially positive contribution.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Group: Okay. And then lastly, can you talk about the 458 million bottom end of the site leasing revenue range? Does that assume Clearwire doesn't happen and that carriers pulled back a little bit, how do you get to that number?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah. You'd have to have all those things and probably some more. I mean, I don't really think we're going to be at the bottom end of our revenue guidance.  
Clayton Moran - Stanford Group: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Ric Prentis with Raymond James.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James: Yeah. Hey, good morning guys. Couple of question for you. Jeff, as you think of your balance sheet, how much cash on hand do you want to keep on the balance sheet and with that I mean cash, short-term investment, restricted cash, etcetera?
Jeff Stoops: We don't need to keep a lot and with the current focus, I mean let me back up. We're in this Ric and we've always been in it to maximize shareholder value. Right now I think, shareholder value is being depressed by concerns and uncertainties over the 2010-2011 refinancing obligations that we have. So with that being our focus, to remove that concern, maximize shareholder value as a result, the money that we would be holding is ultimately going to go in these current market conditions to repay and refinance that debt. So we don't see any real reason to sit on cash at 2.5% or whatever it is we are earning, it might not even be that, when we can go out and retire debt particularly at a discount and actually begin to make not only progress but substantial progress when you combine debt at a discount. So, we don't need to hold, particularly with a reduced view on discretionary spending. I don't know; $40 million, $50 million would be well more than sufficient. I don't know if we'll ever get down that low, but we could.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James: And then speaking of buying back your debt, little hard to see where the debt's trading and almost kind of by appointment some of the stuff out there. Where are you seeing the debt trading now, is it still in the 80s, has it moved into the 90s yet?
Jeff Stoops: A couple things have happened. I mean one of the reasons that I believe our stock took the low dip that it did as we had some forced selling by some of our hedge fund holders that same dynamic also caused some of the holders of our convertible notes which were in a lot of hedge funds to look for liquidity. And because of our convertible notes are primarily equity like in their nature, they do have a high correlation to our stock price. So, as our stock price was lower, we took advantage of that and some of the pressure on the hedge fund holders for liquidity to buy that stuff at really good rates, which I think blended out to less than 70. I think today those notes would be certainly higher with the higher stock price. They are probably somewhere above 80 today, which we will monitor that and we will kind of use that pricing to guide us as to whether we continue to be interested in the '10 converts or whether we move our interest to the CMBS which don't really trade so much in correlation to our stock price, but they trade in correlation to different debt issues and the need for liquidity with some of those holders. So, we actually have a lot of opportunities there. I mean there is plenty more out there than we will actually have the cash to pursue and as a result, I think we'll be selective and have the opportunity to acquire some of this stuff at a very good price. But the comments that I laid out earlier don't even assume any of that. So, anything we do additionally with the repurchases at a discount can only improve the profile.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James: And then as you think about your available capacity on the revolver, where is that at? Is it like around $60 million and how do you think about drying on that to take our other higher cost debt maybe putting in place that they will last longer, how is that going to play into your thinking Pam may be?
Pam Kline: We have about $60 million left Ric, but we are not able to under the existing credit facility to use that to repurchase debt. We can use that for tower acquisitions, new builds and ground lease acquisitions.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James: Got you. Okay, thanks, guys.
Jeff Stoops: Let me just add to that, Ric. What we could do, because the little discretionary spending that we do have guided to would all fall under that. We could actually use a credit facility to fund the discretionary spending that we have guided to in '09 which will free up additional cash. So, it kind of get you to the same spot.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James: Right, so I think at $25 million to $50 million in discretionary cap, you could use the available all on the revolver to go after that?
Jeff Stoops: Yes. 
Ric Prentis - Raymond James: Okay. Very good. Thanks.
Operator: We have a question from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Yes. So, just with respect to the '09 outlook, you kind of talked about Cox and Clearwater being additives to the outlook relative to '08 but that the rest of the carriers would be relatively flat. I'm curious with respect to the emerging carriers Leap and Metro that are expanding their footprint. Do you think with regard to those carriers, you are seeing more of a weighting towards one year or the other or would that be kind of equal impacts in '08 versus '09? And your comments on Clearwire, I was curious about whether you start to see significant levels of site leasing sooner than mid year or is there some sort of a multi-month lead time that you expect to see before leases get signed in large quantities?
Jeff Stoops: I'll say a few things and Kurt jump in and add your thoughts. But on the Leap, Metro has got a lot going on right now and will continue to have a lot as they look to meet their 2009 launch dates. So, we expect that activity to continue certainly all the way through past the middle of '09, Jonathan which is what certainly impacts the '09 reported results and I think similar with Leap. Kurt, you may have some more color?
Kurt Bagwell: No. I think that's right. Metro has had a huge year this year, but they've got some follow on build out they've got to do in some of these big northeast markets and where they're going to have a lot to do next year as well and we hope Leap actually is bigger next year than this year.
Jeff Stoops: And on the Clearwire, I want to make sure everybody understands my comments. The comments really relate to the operational relationship of when leases need to be signed for them to show up in our financial results. I'm assuming, Clearwire comes out of the blocks pretty quick first of the year. But even if they do, Jonathan, take a half, basically you get a half year of operational activity that impacts the 2009 leasing results because there's a one to two quarter lag, which is why we made the comments. But from a, I think a bigger picture perspective, we are engaged today in a number of different conversations with Clearwire that cause us to continue to believe that when their merger deal does close, they will hit the ground running very quickly.
Kurt Bagwell: Yeah. And a lot of that is based on the fact also that they are going to utilize the existing Sprint, Nextel locations for a lot of their broadcast points. So amending a site can happen very quickly versus new searchings.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: And then on the target levered ratio, it sounds like that's coming under reassessment and it might be awhile before you kind of reach any conclusions, but what are the some of the factors that you'll be looking at as you assess whether it's five to seven or maybe some lower range?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah. I think operationally, we've always been comfortable at eight. The business throws off the kind of cash flow and it grows, but now we'll have to see where things table out in terms of their relationship of cost and certainty refinancing against leverage. And once the markets stabilize a bit Jon then we'll look at relative accessibility of debt and its cost at various leverage levels and target the level that maximizes equity free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. And it's hard for me to give you an exact number today because it's moving around but you can trust that we're thinking about that all the time and as market stabilize, we'll have a more definitive view for you.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: And the M&A side, it sounds like you are [biased] to enter for the time being. What are you seeing about the general pace of smaller scale M&A in the private markets either the pace or multiples?
Jeff Stoops: I think it's pretty slow. I mean, everybody gets it. They understand what's going on in the world today. They understand that credit markets are tight and that has a direct impact on the willingness of companies like us to continue at the pace we've been proceeding at the last couple of years. I think where folks do need to sell there are opportunities for reduced prices and there will be some of that. I don't think that will be that great. I think more likely you'll have folks who say I don't need to sell and I think this is a crazy time in terms of credit and its resulting impact on valuations and I'm going to wait this out for a while as well. I really don't think you'll see a lot of distressed sellers who sell out at the bottom here.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you very much.
Operator: We have a question from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks good morning, a couple of questions. First just to get back to the debt question, Jeff, I think you mentioned in your comments obviously there is a significant portion of your towers outside of sort of the existing CMBS plan. So, opportunities, potentially to borrow against those towers, I guess what many of us especially in the equity community struggle with is what the rate structure is going to look like given huge spreads, limited transparency, etcetera in some of these debt markets. So, can you maybe step back and give us a framework for what rates in this environment you'd be comfortable deploying this strategy if needed? And then second getting just sort of getting back to the churn rates in the business and the outlook; Sprint has been sluggish for this part of the year, I am just wondering if you saw any sort of pick up in the quarter and how this extents into guidance. I know for the big four you sort of said status quo into '09. Is the interpretation there that Sprint continues to be extremely sluggish into '09? Thanks.
Jeff Stoops: I'll answer the last one first, Jason, which is yes. I mean, Sprint didn't contribute much to '08 and we are prepared about our 2009 outlook with similar expectations. I mean, on the debt, obviously I don't know exactly what the spread will be in 2010. But think this one through with me, and I go back a lot to the 2002-2003 time period. You've got an environment that's likely to be sluggish economically. LIBOR is to be low and stay low as we move into 2010 and 2011. I mean, we're borrowing today at 150 to at 6.9 turns 300 over LIBOR. Even if you take that up dramatically, with the low LIBOR, you're talking about refinancing rates that aren't really too materially higher than they are today and certainly way below what we have read about some analysts thinking is it's kind of the doomsday scenario. So, I think we're going to be helped from this low LIBOR kind of sluggish recession environment exactly as we were back in 2002-2003. I think spreads will be higher, but I think by that time you add the two together, it's not going to be all that bad. And this is what I believe even more so with absolute degree of conviction, banks will lend. They will say, if I can borrow Fed funds at 1% and lend it at 400 spread SBA at 5% or pick any number there that you think is reasonable, that will happen because banks will need to make money and towers have always been right at the very top of the list in terms of borrowing. So, while I can't tell you exactly where that spread will be in 2010, I feel really good about our ability to work through these economic times and come out on the back end with a result that's a whole lot better than people are expecting.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: And Jeff maybe as it just relates to your comfort level that the ability to sort of find windows or pockets of opportunity here and extend sort of at least the term structure of the debt, is there a certain rate, can you tell us if you got the opportunity to do a lot of long-term debt at 8%, would that be acceptable? Is there some sort of rate you can throw out there as a framework for us?
Jeff Stoops: No, I don't really want to do that for competitive reasons. And you can assume though that we've had a history of being extremely creative and opportunistic in the financing markets and we will continue to do that. We'll have a lot of markets that we'll be looking at. We could do additional converts, we could go back to the high yield market, we could obviously and certainly look to a broadened bank market and the Term Loan B market. We'll see where CMBS is two years from now. We certainly wouldn’t have to do, we could stay all investment grade in the CMBS market and easily refinance what we're talking about. So I will say this to you though, Jason. To remove what I believe is a penalty being applied to our stock today. We will take advantage of opportunities that will lend certainty to the longer-term as they arise.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Okay great. Thanks. 
Operator: You have a question from Brett Feldman with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman - Barclays Capital: Yes, thanks. Just a point of clarification, it may be a bigger question. The point of clarification, you talked about earlier how your outlook for 2009 I think implies and on a cash basis same-tower revenue leasing revenue would be growing about 10%. What's the comparable number for third quarter '08 and for 2008 based on our outlook for this year?
Jeff Stoops: No, what I said Brett is that the dollar amount will be the same. Actually, as you work off the increasingly greater base each year, the same dollar figure of growth typically translates into a one percentage point reduction in growth rate because you are always working off a bigger base, right?
Brett Feldman - Barclays Capital: Yes. 
Jeff Stoops: So, we are projecting we add greater incremental dollars per tower. But the percentage growth rate is likely to be flattish with where we are right now just because of the increasingly larger base. And the number for Q3 was 10%.
Brett Feldman - Barclays Capital: Okay. So, here's the bigger picture question. You talk in the release about how you've more than doubled the size of your portfolio over the last two years. We know that you are going to be slowing that pace now because of the credit markets. But even if the credit markets were there the opportunity to double your portfolio again in two years probably wasn’t there just because you've already consolidated most of the sizable private portfolios. So, I guess maybe the question is what if we flip this around? Do you think there are synergies available to your shareholders by achieving meaningful scale by combining with a bigger tower operator?
Jeff Stoops: Theoretically, yes. There are large synergies that exist in the business that could be maximized in that type of a combination.
Brett Feldman - Barclays Capital: How do you think about that? Is it mostly strategic stuff? Is it just getting rid of overhead? Do you think there are financing synergies? I'm just wondering how you think about the benefit of increasing your scale?
Jeff Stoops: Well, I think we've been very clear on how we think about that and I think our thoughts have changed. We don't think revenue synergies exist because of the approach of carriers to his look at one tower at a time. The real synergies exist in the SG&A line and the back office and I don't know that synergies exist so much in capital markets. I think any of the sizable public companies there the issue is more at what leverage they want to attain rather than if you are bigger do you somehow get a better deal. I don't think that has existed for several years. So the real synergy that you are speaking of and that we would think is attainable is in the back office.
Brett Feldman - Barclays Capital: So, you don't necessarily think about your balance sheet maybe be in the refinancing you have to focus on being somehow enhanced by being combined with somebody else?
Jeff Stoops: No. We're going to be bind on the refinancing based on the one path and there is a bunch more that we haven't talked about. The real issue long-term is here is the real issue that we will be addressing over the long-term. Where does the capital structure ultimately settle at what point to maximize shareholder value and we have within that appropriate capital structure, the right opportunities for additional growth that maximize shareholder value as an independent company.
Brett Feldman - Barclays Capital: Okay. Well, thanks for taking the question.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. 
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thanks very much. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the medium-term, are you seeing any early signs around LTE from Verizon. You talked a lot about AT&T and T-Mobile. But as we've seen in Canada some HSPA deployment by Bell Canada and TELUS and any sort of sense that as we exit '09, we'll start to see some revenue coming through from that and into 2010 and perhaps with all your acquisitions recently, can you give us some a sort of end of the quarter where your customer mix is, what are the sort of percentages in the various categories? Thanks.
Kurt Bagwell: Simon, this is Kurt. On the LTE, '09 would be a stretch for getting revenue out of that from Verizon or anyone else has announced that path. I think a lot of planning and a lot of testings will happen in 09, but I don't think you are realistically going to see any revenue in '09. I think that's more of an '10 start for deployment for sure.
Jeff Stoops: Brendan, correct me if I'm wrong here. But on a pro forma basis Simon, I think AT&T is about 27ish percent of leasing revenue, Sprint is 23%-24% the combined Verizon, Alltel is 16ish percent, and I think then T-Mobile is 11% or 12% and growing.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then what about Metro and Leap, where do [they account]?
Jeff Stoops: They are still relatively small. What are they? 2% or 3%?
Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I think Leap is a little bit bigger. They are maybe 3% or 4% and Metro is even smaller, 1% or 2% right now.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut with Jefferies.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jefferies: Thank you. Most of my question have been asked and answered but I was wondering if you could give us the cell sites per tower number. And then on the wireless backhaul that you mentioned as potential opportunity and you were seeing in activity, I was wondering if that was coming from operators directly or if you were seeing that from kind of third-party backhaul providers and then if you can give us some call around what the level of application activity was? Thank you.
Jeff Stoops: I think, Jonathan, two and a half tenants per tower where we ended the quarter. And that, that is likely to stay the same as we work through at least for the fourth quarter as we work through Light Tower and Optasite which both had fewer than that on the tenants per tower basis. Kurt, do you want to speak to the wireless backhaul?
Kurt Bagwell: Wireless backhaul Jonathan is, it's a mix of the carriers putting in some themselves and there is also third-parties out there doing it. We are seeing a little bit more interest from third-party wireless backhaul providers. But it's really a mixed bag right now. But we are seeing a lot of the carriers doing it themselves. And then we are also, as I said, we are also seeing a lot of fiber being pulled to these sites, it don’t have a huge economic effect on us, because they really don't take that much space at all on our compounds but it's a great thing for our carriers to have access to because these new technologies, especially the WiMAX and LTE are going to demand incredible amounts of backhaul at these sites. That's a real challenge for the carriers right now.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jefferies: Great. Applications activity?
Kurt Bagwell: It's been good. 
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jefferies: All right, great. The last question has to do with kind of looking out over the long-term here. You've mentioned that you are going to focus mostly the internal cash flows on your balance sheet or towards your balance sheet over the next call it 15 months or so. As we look out over the long-term, are your goals of 5% to 10% portfolio growth are something that we should be thinking about as we look into 2010 and beyond?
Jeff Stoops: Ultimately, we want to get back there, Jonathan. The way we're looking at the current scenario is we exist to maximize shareholder value. The world today is saying to maximize shareholder value. We want more certainty around refinancing. So, that's what we are doing today. That situation will correct itself at some point in which event we would fully expect given our history and success and capabilities in portfolio growth and the fact we think it's a great long-term business operationally that we would resume that.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jefferies: Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. 
Jeff Stoops: Sure. Paul, we're going to have time for one more question if there is one.
Operator: Okay. We'll go next to the line of Gray Powell with Wachovia. Please go ahead. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Looks like I'm just getting in here under the line. I have a few. Just based on your Q4 guidance and I know you've touched on this already, but it looks like you're going to exit the year with about a 10% organ revenue growth rate. If I do the math for making the non-cash adjustments for the 2009 guidance, I get closer to like an 8% growth rate. So to me it just seems like you have some sort of cushion in your guidance that gives you the ability to hit the mid point even if carriers pull back significantly on expansion plans next year. Am I looking at that correctly?
Jeff Stoops: Yeah. I think you are and I think our history has been we always put out guidance that we feel very comfortable we'll hit.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay. And then if I just kind of look back over the last couple of years, 2007 was a very back end loaded year, 2008 was fairly even. How should we look at 2009? To me it seems like maybe more front end loaded?
Jeff Stoops: I don't know about front end loaded. I think it will be steady. You are going to have the new market entrance or the new entrance of any type. Clearwire, Cox, I think once they start we'll stay busy for the whole year. You've got a lot of existing momentum that will carry into '09 from AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile. Don't really expect that to vain as we move through the year. So, I think it's going to be steady, Gray.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay. And then I know you can't give too much detail here on it's like carrier-by-carrier basis, but can you give us an idea as to the level of discussions that you've held with Cox Cable and kind of when you would expect to start to see some sort of benefit from that build?
Jeff Stoops: I mean, we have had discussions but unfortunately we are not at liberty to share those with you. I mean that's just the way Cox wants it.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay. Fair enough. That's all I got. Thank you very much.
Jeff Stoops: Great. Well thank you, everyone. We appreciate you dialing in and I guess the next time we'll speak will be late February or early March and we look forward to discussing our results with you then.

I will now to turn the conference over to Pam Kline, Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President of Capital Markets: Thank you for joining us this morning for SBA's second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kurt Bagwell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Macaione, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I need to get the standard SEC disclosure out.

These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and our SEC filings, particularly those set forth in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results, and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, August 04, 2008, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G.

Anthony J. Macaione - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Pam and good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release this morning, our second quarter financial results were excellent and we were near or above the high end of our guidance for site leasing revenues, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and equity free cash flow. Total revenues were $112 million, up 11.6% over the year-earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $93.7 million or 17.8% increase over the second quarter 2007. This site leasing revenue growth was driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Site leasing segment operating profit was $71.1 million. Site leasing contributed 98% of total segment operating profit in the second quarter. Tower cash flow for the second quarter 2008, was $71.8 million or 23.8% increase over the year-earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 78.1%, up 310 basis points over the year-earlier period and 60 basis points over the first quarter of 2008. Our services revenue was $18.2 million compared to $20.7 million in the year-earlier period or a 12.2% decrease. Services segment operating profit was $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2008 and $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2007. Services segment operating profit margins were 7.9% in the second quarter, compared to 13% in year-earlier period. Kurt will discuss services in more details, shortly. Our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $12.5 million, including non-cash compensation charges of $2.4 million. This compares to SG&A expense of $11.6 million in the year-earlier period including non-cash compensation charges of $2.1 million. Other non-cash expenses for the second quarter included an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $2.5 million related to certain auction rate securities held at June 30, 2008. As previously discussed, the company still holds three auction rate securities with a par value of $29.8 million which had a fair value of $9.3 million as of June 30, 2008. Net loss during the second quarter was $18.4 million, compared to a net loss of $15.1 million in the year-earlier period. Net loss per share for the second quarter was $0.17 compared to a net loss of $0.15 in the year-earlier period. Excluding the $2.5 million non-cash impairment charge in the auction rate securities, our net loss per share would have been $0.15. Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were $107.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA as we define it for the second quarter of 2008 was $63.5 million in the second quarter or 23.4% increase over the year-earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 57.7%, up 52.5% in the year-earlier period. Once again equity free cash flow increased materially in the quarter, reflecting a strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Equity free cash flow for the current period was $37.9 million or 30.7% increase over the year-earlier period. Equity free cash flow per share for the current period was $0.35 per share, a 25% increase over the year-earlier period. While we are pleased with the growth in equity free cash flow per share, it would have been even high on a pro forma basis if we were to get full effect during the quarter for the convertible note offering in the TowerCo acquisition. In the second quarter, we acquired 555 towers, built 18 towers and ended the quarter with 6,896 towers owned and the rights to manage approximately 4,400 additional or potential communication sites. Cash capital expenditures in the second quarter were $264.5 million, of which we spent $1.3 million on maintenance tower CapEx, $1.3 million on augmentations and rebuilds and $220,000 on general corporate CapEx. We also spent $250.6 million of cash on acquisitions and earn-outs and $5.6 million on new tower built and newbuild work-in-process. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we've spent an aggregate of $5.9 million in cash to buy land and easement and to extent ground lease terms. And at this point, I'll turn things over to Pam to provide an update on our liquidity position in our balance sheet.
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President of Capital Markets: Thanks Tony. SBA ended the second quarter with $1.555 billion of commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates outstanding, $315 million in 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes, $550 million of 1.875% Convertible Senior Note, significant outstanding on our $335 million borrowed [ph] under senior credit facility and $242.5 million of cash and short-term restricted cash, resulting in net debt of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we issued $550 million of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes during 2013. We used approximately $74.1 million of the proceeds for the note offering and we related warrant transactions to purchase convertible notes hedges, which when taken with the warrant transactions as a whole, effectively increased the conversion price of the note from $41.46 per share to $67.37 per share. Additionally, 120 million of the note proceeds were used to repurchase 3.47 million shares of our common stock at a price of $34.55. Our share count at the end of the quarter was 105.9 million. The company's net GAAP to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 8.7 times at June 30, 2008. Our net secured debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 5.2 times. Our auction rate securities are not included in our calculation of liquidity or net debt. As of quarter-end, all of our debt was fixed rate with a weighted average cash kept under 4.23% per year. Our second quarter cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest was very strong at 2.7 times. As of the day of our press release, we had zero outstanding in total availability of 278.9 million under our senior credit facility. As we build and buy towers, additional availability is created under this facility [ph], pro forma for the light tower and other transactions under signed purchase contracts, we estimate that the total availability under the facility will be the $435 million [ph]. We anticipate using a combination of cash on hand, draws from the credit facility and our stock to fund our closing obligations for all of our pending acquisitions. I will now turn it over to Kurt to discuss some of our operational results.
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Pam and good morning. As you can see by the numbers, Q2 was another good quarter for us. It continue to show the steady lease up and the resulting revenues from our desirable tower space, a consistent and predictable nature of our expenses, and the efficiency of our scale through the highest steadily-increasing tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA and gross margins. In addition, most of our customers continue to report excellent operational and financial results for both voice and data services, which we expect will continue even down the path of continued network enhancement. On a per site basis, our growth tower leasing revenue signed in the quarter was ahead of our Q2, 2007 actual rate. And our net leasing revenue signed was equal to or better than any quarter in the past two years, including our big fourth quarter of 2007. It is also our best growth in net leasing revenue quarter on an absolute basis. For the quarter, year-over-year same tower cash leasing revenue and same tower cash flow growth, excluding a small amount of Cingular-AT&T merger related churn, was 11% and 14% respectively, once again the highest in our industry. While rates have stayed firm, our average cash spaces rents across our 16, 851 tenants, is up about 5% year-over-year to $1840 per month. During the second quarter, 81% of our new leasing revenues signed came from new tenant leases with the other 19% coming from amendments to existing installations. The new leases continue to come predominantly from three of the four big four carriers. We have also seen steady activity from new and existing regional carriers. The mix of new lease activities is widespread from geographic coverage expansion to performance-enhancing sales, technology overweight and they cover building penetration and capacity needs. Wireless backhaul has also gained momentum and we are starting to see what we think is a broader, long-term movement towards escalation from several of our major customers. We're also seeing renewed interest in this area from third-party providers. Our new tower build team completed another 18 towers during the quarter, putting them on track to have the best year since the restart of this program a couple of years ago. We also bought an additional 555 towers during the quarter, putting our total owned tower count to 6,896 at quarter's end. The TowerCo transaction closed on May 30 and the integration was smoothest ever for such large portfolio. Our operations and leasing teams have done a lot of advanced planning and picked up these assets and began running with them immediately after closing. For TowerCo, Light Tower and Optasite and our other 2008 additions, we expect to add fewer than ten additional personnel on the operations side which truly shows the efficiency of scale in the tower model. On the operational side of our tower portfolio, both OpEx and CapEx expenses continue to be relatively minimal and within our budget. Our tower augmentation CapEx was once again very well; we're spending right at $1 million on supporting revenue additions on high demand towers. Our gross expense in the period has been running at just about $1 million per quarter with an annualized rate of less than $1000 per tower per year. On a per tower basis, our expenses in these areas continue to be lowest in the industry by a pretty wide margin. Lastly in the expense area, the percentage of our towers for which we own or control for more than 50 years the underlying land was up to 25% as of June 30th, contributing to our strong margins and risk control. On the services side of our business, Q2 was a tighter quarter for us given the near stoppage of Osborne [ph] activity which was our largest services customer from the last couple of quarters. Revenue of $18.2 million was down 12% year-over-year, and down 11% compared to Q1. Unlike on the tower leasing side of our business where we provide service equally to all interested wireless carriers, the services business has always been more concentrated as to one or two customers in any given quarter. And in Q2, and possibly in Q3 that concentration and Sprints pullback has impacted and may continue to impact results. Our services teams are continuing the process of reloading their backlogs with a more diverse customer base, and we feel our future quarters would see an uptick from Q2's results. We believe we are well positioned for several new projects with new entrants building both, 3G and 4G networks as well as new projects from existing providers. We are very excited about our pending Optasite and Light Tower acquisitions. We are already well into our pre-closing integration activities, and we expect things will go very smoothly. In addition to the large number of existing high-quality towers, both transactions bring material newbuild pipelines in relationship they will produce new towers throughout in 2008 and more in 2009. Finally, we are particularly excited about entering the entering the outdoor DAS business through a Light Tower, where we will have the opportunity to confirm our belief about the attractive mix of the business, add some very talented employees, learn the business from a ground up and create new opportunities for attractive future capital investments. While we do not believe DAS will come close to towers in operational or financial importance to SBA, we do believe DAS will play an important niche role in future wireless appointment and we look forward to being a part of it. At this point, I'll turn things over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Kurt and good morning everyone. As I think you'll agree, we have been busy this summer at SBA. We have done a number of things, but not only we will generate material growth in 2008, but more importantly position us extremely well for additional growth in 2009, 2010 and beyond. Everything we have done and we will continue to do is focused on a single goal, maximizing growth and equity free cash flow per share while maintaining an appropriate balance sheet. If we are successful in doing that, we believe our shareholders will continue to be rewarded over both the short-term and long-term. We view the market and our share price as the ultimate judge of our success, and in that regard, we believe our strategy and execution have been proven to be very successful. Our share price has materially outperformed our peers and any relevant index over the last one, three and five-year periods. The factors behind that success remain important, relevant and in place today and we are very optimistic about our ability to produce continued success in the future. The foundation of our success is two-fold; first, the explosive growth in wireless and the needs of our wireless carrier customers to continue to invest in the expansion and improvement of their networks. Second; our ability to execute our business plan and capitalize on opportunities when presented. Both are very strong. As we have heard from Kurt and others before us, wireless continues to grow and in fact and has become the growth engine for the large multi-product telecom providers. 2G, 3G and soon 4G deployments are expected to drive strong continued demand for tower space. We just finished one of our strongest lease-up quarters and years and we did so without material contributions from several carriers, which carriers had been much busier in the past and we expect to be much busier in the future. Wireless data use is soaring. Data requires more network capacity and a higher level of complexity, both of which are increasingly addressed at the physical network level through additional equipment. We expect the deployment of the recently auctioned 700 megahertz spectrum will extend this cycle of new services which leads to consumer adoption and increasing usage and finally, required network improvement for years to come. We see strong continued leasing growth for assets in 2009, 2010 and beyond, which is why we are so excited to be growing our company with additional high-quality towers. On the execution side, we continue to perform very well. Our 11% same tower cash, lease and revenue growth and 14% same tower cash flow growth once again lead our industry and by a material amount. In addition to our organic growth, our portfolio growth is well ahead of plan and is expected to be over 25% this year alone. We expect to end the year with close to 8,000 towers. As a result growth in each of leasing revenue, tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are all very strong and led our industry this quarter by wide margin. Expenses remain well in check, as our tower, cash flow margin and adjusted EBITDA margins were our highest ever. Maintenance capital expenditures and augmentation expenses once again were the lowest in the industry, reflecting both our asset quality and the great work of our employees. Our employees continue to perform excellently and I thank them for their hard work. We are very happy with the acquisitions that we've closed or announced this year. We are acquiring quality assets at reasonable and accretive prices ahead of what we believe will be a strong customer demand in 2009 and beyond. We seized on these opportunities because we believe they will produce greater near term and long-term accretion to equity free cash flow per share than we would have achieved with stock repurchases and once acquired, we will speed de-leveraging because we've added additional growth assets to the company. With our successes this year, we had firmly established SBA as the pre-eminent acquirer in the tower industry. Two of the three large deals, we've announced this year were sole sourced to SBA by the sellers and their bankers on an exclusive basis and none of our peers nor anyone else had a chance to look at these opportunities. Why was that? Because in the seller community, SBA has a ten-year track record of straight dealing, confidentiality, efficient negotiation, documentation enclosing, problem solving, and most importantly getting deals closed on the terms on which they were agreed. No one comes close to the aggregate number of transactions we've closed to that time period. We are extremely deep and capable in the acquisition area and we have developed it to the point where we do believe it is a competitive advantage. We believe these strengths will continue to serve us well going forward and be even more important as we move into a world of acquisition opportunities that may lack for sizable transactions, but we think we will have an abundance of 10, 20, and 50 tower opportunities. These types of opportunities have historically been our bread and butter and we believe SBA is the most capable potential acquirer for these sized transactions. We intend to stay active pursuing those types of opportunities, notwithstanding the materially larger tower count by which we will end the year, we continue to believe that we can keep growing portfolio 5% to 10% per year for the foreseeable future and the four good opportunities in the U.S. would be there for SBA to do that. Now that I have told you how good we feel about our future acquisition prospects, I need to temper that a little bit at least temporarily. You should not expect us to announce any material, additional cash acquisitions prior to year end. We want to take the rest of the year a close to Optasite and Light Tower, integrate the assets into our company which we expect will go smoothly and take advantage of expected strong continued organic growth to reduce leverage as we move into 2009. We have plenty of liquidity. That is not the issue, in fact we believe we have no need to access the capital markets prior to 2010 and we still expect to have enough liquidity to grow the portfolio 5% to 10% per year through cash investments, if we so choose. The desire to reduce leverage is driven more by our watching the current conditions in the credit markets and wanting to best position SBA for smooth refinancings in 2010 and 2011. At the end of the third quarter, we expect leverage to be similar to leverage at the end of the second quarter, as we will be in the middle of closing the Optasite and Light Tower transactions. We expect to end 2008 reporting a low eight times total net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which would be less on a pro forma basis, because we don't expect to close on Light Tower until the end of October. By the end of 2009, we expect to be at the low seven times-high six times range on a total basis and approximately two times lower on a secured basis, even after investing the cash necessary to achieve our goal of five 5% to 10% portfolio growth in 2009. Leverage would be even lower, if we choose to reduce our future cash investing which we could always do and would do depending on credit market conditions. We believe this path which includes both growth and de-leveraging will put us in excellent shape for our 2010 refinancing obligations. Based on where we expect leverage to be at that time if the markets were exactly the same as they are today, we believe we could refinance our 2010 obligations entirely in either the CMBS market or the bank market, or we may chose a combination of both. In closing, we cannot be more pleased at our position as we move into the second half of 2008. We will be adding to our company a material number of high growth towers and newbuild opportunities. We will enter the DAS business. Our customers are very busy with good prospects, which we anticipate will translate into an even higher level of activity in 2009. We will end the year with solid liquidity and a leverage position which we expect will create additional material value for our shareholders, as we de-lever fairly quickly from expected strong organic growth. We are very excited about our future and look forward to next time we can share our progress with you. Cathy, we can open up for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, good morning. I think Kurt mentioned in terms of the site leasing activity that three years, the national carriers were active; curious to get a view as to when that fourth carrier might start spending again? Anything we're seeing here on the site leasing side or in your services business that gives you any indication there. And then with respect to Outdoor DAS, can you talk about Light Tower in terms of their current scale. How many installations? How many customers? And how that business might get ramped over time? Thank you.
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Jonathan this is Kurt, obviously the fourth or the big four, it's a little unclear still exactly when we'll start ranking backup, they are making a lot of moves obviously to get themselves in better positions and I don't want to get two customers specific here but we hope this, by the end of third quarter, fourth quarter they are back in the... a better here than they were now. But that's not a 100% clear to us this year. So I will leave that one at that. On the DAS systems, they have got five existing systems and one larger one it's in construction, right now. The systems average about three tenants per system now and some of other installations, multiple bands per tenant which would basically look like how much in other tenant. So they are definitely, they've done a very nice job of not just building several systems but building ones that are truly multiple tenant which is... what we really like about the Light Tower DAS business is, it's very similar to our tower model, they have been very selective.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: And Jonathan, I would add that the financial attractiveness of the business is very good at this point. Kurt mentioned the three tenants per system, we are approaching this the way we approach the tower business, which is looking for multi-tenant opportunities. We think that's the right way we can gallop. The returns on invested capital over time have been really, really good for what Light Tower has done. The issue for us, which we will be kind of studying and then drawing some conclusions on over time, is actually how big we can take the success that they've had. Not quite sure yet, people should not expect that, we will be materially moving the needle through DAS in the short term and as we continue to evaluate opportunities, we will keep you posted.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: In terms of how to ramp the business, if you were to do so organically will that require extra people or is your current site development organization able to handle Outdoor DAS, or do you think the acquisition is maybe to be more likely route for growth in that business?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we certainly have the platform now to consider that moving forward and we will have to see how that goes. In terms of employees, we will be picking up five or six folks or right from the get go with Light Tower and there will be some additional, folks as we work... as we wrap up we'd want but it's not going to be a huge number of additional folks necessary for us to what we think martially to grow the business, but again materially from where it is, not material when you look at in the context of the overall SBA organization.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you we will go to Ric Prentis with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey Ric.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Couple of questions for you, first Jeff on the M&A front. Thanks for lot of heads up there about probably not a lot of big ones left out there, based on the current environment more 10, 20, 50s. You mentioned a couple of times don't expect any more cash deals and cash, how do you look at stock versus cash, when you are going through these transactions and also the ability to either acquire debt in the transaction or put it into existing capital structure?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Optasite deal really brought along some very good attributes in terms of financing with us being able to assume the existing debt at a very favorable and below market rate and issue stock for most of the rest of our consideration. In effect, we did not use up any of our existing cash resources or will not use up any of our existing cash resources to do that deal. And it was still done so on a very accretive basis so, we like that one a lot. We've always used our stock to supplement our capital resources. We are very careful on how we use our stock and we pay particular attention to where the stock is trading at time, we would issue the relationship of accretion at that time to the assets that we are buying. But it's always been a tool for us to make sure we're fully capable of seizing the good opportunities that we see are out there and staying within our overall leverage and deleveraging targets as we move forward. So as we do bigger deals and did so this year, you see a fairly good size on a combined basis of stock in the aggregate consideration. As we move forward, we may or may not be doing that based on what the opportunity pull on and the size of them and where we see the various price relationships. But it's always something that we've used as a tool to make sure we don't miss out on any acquisition opportunities, while at the same time managing our leverage position.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, next question, I think Tony mentioned 98% of the revenues for site leasing in the second quarter. A little concerned in the marketplace today, I think about the site development sources business. Can you talk a little bit about where you see that business going and what kind of percent of revenue and EBITDA should that business maybe represent and what's the benefits of keeping it versus selling?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I am not sure why people should be overly concerned. I think it was pretty clear for the last couple of quarters that Sprint was big services customer of us and I think everybody should know or as plenty out there know that Sprint was not that busy this quarter and may not be that busy in the third quarter. For us, it has always been a business that keeps us close to the customer, keeps us very current on what carriers are doing in terms of the equipment deployments and network expansion that translates into we think smarter leasing and asset acquisition decisions on the hard asset side of the business. But in... it was, so from a gross profit perspective, it was 2% this quarter. I think over the last year, it has been no higher than 5%, and I think now as you pro forma in Light Tower and Optasite and the other things that we are doing, even at its highest contribution from picking out any quarter in the last four, it probably would be 3% or 4% of gross profit. So it's not... it doesn't really impact EBITDA, certainly or equity free cash flow. We continue to see newbuild opportunities that come out of it. We continue to mostly see as I mentioned though the customer and challenges factor and in terms of going forward, as Kurt mentioned, we've got a couple of things, irons in the fire that we think will produce improved business as we move through the rest of the year, and we'll keep you abreast of that. And if we don't see that, then we will as we always have with this business, we will possibly be thinking about its future direction.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then final question for you, because obviously it seems like the service business is that definitely the tail small to a 5% comp of the business. The DAS system, trying to hit that a little bit, looks like an attractive niche, probably doesn't get huge for you guys in the grand scheme given your entire model. If you think about the DAS systems and now you have been looking at with Light Tower, what kind of the ratio to how many nodes were in the DAS system versus an equivalent towers? There is something we should be looking at as we think of DAS, and also as you have been looking at DAS with the Light Tower guys, what kind of... is it a replacement per tower, or is there an augmentation or is it a alternative to tower? Just... how they kind of play into the tower leasing space?
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, it's... there are... the answer to your first question is very site-specific, and it ranges anywhere from three to six nodes to replace a macro sell site. So one macro is the equivalent of three to six DAS nodes based on all the work that we've done so far. We've got a lot of conversation with carriers. In every instance, they have indicated that they would prefer a macro site to a DAS system. DAS has found its niche in terms of places were towers can't get to and the best example is really an asset that we're we putting up at Light Tower which is their flagship DAS network, its WAN tuck-in system where a substantial portion of all the wireless on tuck-in is transported over that system. The WAN is not a place where we're going to get a lot of towers build, just can't happen. And that's similar to the other places where Light Tower has built these networks and that's kind of the model that we're going to pursue going forward, it's absolutely a adjunct and ancillary to towers, its is based on everything we've seen and expect, it's is not a replacement for towers.
Ric Prentis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot. Good luck guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks very much. You've made few interesting comments on Wireless backhaul, perhaps you could provide a little bit more detail around what you're seeing and how material that is and could be for you. And on the comments about leverage, can you talk about buyback from the context that you are fairly active this quarter, is that something where we might see some what less activity in the second half given the focus on de-leveraging? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Kurt?
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Simonour leverage... on backhaul; we are seeing the carriers start to deploy more and more their own microwave backhaul, mostly licensed spectrum that they can pick up through the government system on someone license but mostly license, and it's very high capacity. And yes, carrier historically had especially old cellphone companies they had a lot of wireless backhaul. They kind of moved away from the T1s over the years and so the pricing of T1s is getting more competitive. But now, it's really the data demands and just the capacity they needed certain sites, I mean a lot of carriers and their core say at suburban network, need 5,6,8,10,12 T1s just for themselves at single site. And the price points, there is a crossover point between the point at CapEx and paying for that recurring rate on T1. So, we are seeing a lot more carrier movement towards that. You have obviously seen Fibertower over the past several of years to point following third party wireless backhaul services, they continue and there is others in that space as well and they are entering that space. And if you look at some of the stats on what... how data is going to drive the backhaul demand, it's really eye opening. It's really saddening what has to happen at these sites, and so they don't...they are cogged up. And... so the materiality wise it's not huge yet. It's now going to be as biggest for kind of lease but we do think it's growing. And we hope to... I think it's really steady growth too in the last for a lot of years.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: And some of these microwave additions that we're seeing are adding over $1000 per month to the existing tenant rent. So it actually in specific locations is pretty nice.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: If you get the sense that the carriers are kind of having to scramble that the data growth is coming in faster, more volume or mix, expected with things like the iPhone, or laptop cards and they really happen to move faster, keep up with data demand?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we think that's right. We think... as we talk to our customers, wire...the future wireless backhaul solutions are right at the top, if not the top issue that they are all wrestling with. In terms of de-leveraging issue and the buybacks, I think it's important to know why we did the buyback this year and last, they were apart of convertible notes offering. We do buybacks when we do converts because we think it is the best way to maximize the execution of those transactions for the good of our shareholders. If you go back and kind of study RDLs and look at others the issuances in the convert market, RDLs quote price higher at closing of the announcement of those deals than they were at announcement, that's highly unusual, and that's because of the stock repurchase settlement that we put in there as we as the creativeness of the transactions. But understand that those really were tools to maximize the capital raising transactions. While we think buybacks are really good, we think the asset growth that we are doing is great and will produce better attrition over time than stock buybacks which again while good, we always can have those in our good future, we put forth the opportunity that we are seeing today on the asset side. So, I would not think folks should look for a lot of additional stock buybacks as we move to end the year.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Okay.Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Yes thanks. Good morning couple of questions. First, just on the guidance raise, you sort of hit the high end this quarter. You layered in two deals which sort of calculated a range what they might contribute on the back hand, where we sort of can't do about $11 million, yet you moved the high end of the year up $6 million in terms of site leasing revenues. So it just seems like there is a little bit of disconnect there, and that number could have gone up more. Can you provide a little more color there? And then on deals, you mentioned getting full sourced opportunities on pretty good size deals. Then you have got peers are out there saying that they just couldn't get there on the multiples anyways. And I am just wondering if you can sort of flush out those comments a little bit more. I know you have put a little bit of detail but looking for more granularity on why sort of towers perceived differently, your to access to capital or your ability to pay higher multiple are willing to go all sort of things?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, on the guidance Jason, I think we always focus on the midpoint and as we move through the year we tend to bring the bottom up and sometimes bring the top down and you really shouldn't focus necessarily so much on the low or the high. But look at where we've moved the midpoints to kind of understand what we are thinking about where the future will take us. And on the comments, I am not sure what others were speaking to because they really didn't have a chance to evaluate or learn anything about the two deals that I was referring to, not only in terms of self sourcing. So I am not quite sure to which transactions their comments were directed. But our... the reason we end up getting transactions, look at transactions where no one else does is really the history that we have in this area and the relationships that we have with the primary bankers who do most of the work representing towers in this area, particularly the 50 to I'd say 400 or 500 tower transactions. There is a fraternity out there that we have been doing business for ten years. They've closed deals with everybody they know who does their deal smoothly; they know who they trust as working with buyers and yes, as a result through ten years of extremely hard work and really focusing on developing our skills in this area, we've reached a point where folks don't want to necessarily go through the high profile but auction process. They have a number in mind which if they can get to that number they are willing to forego whatever chances an auction might produce, a higher number for certainty and confidence in the counterparty. And that's we are able to provide people and this year was a great example of the success and the progress that we've made there.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Greg Miller with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please. Okay, we move then from queue. So we'll on to Clay Moran with the Stanford Group. Please go ahead.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial: Thank you. Couple of questions; Jeff, you mentioned it was the strongest lease-up quarter, in years. Yet it looks like you didn't raise the site leasing revenue guidance beyond the acquisitions. Can you explain why not? And then I have a couple of other ones.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I mean we by signing... when we talk about strongest lease up in years, remember we talked about leases signed. A lot of those leases don't begin hitting the financial statements till, in some cases two quarters up. So, what this really does is, we'll see some of this in Q4 but it really set us up for 2009.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial: Okay. And then, I think it was Kurt who mentioned that, only three of the four national carriers have really been active. Can you at all quantify the impact if the fourth carrier would have come back and be more to normalized level. What would that do to the lease up rate?
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: It has a very good impact. I mean we don't neither guess Clay or put a number on it but I mean if you got to look back over history and look at side counts and what everybody does, as they reported. It's pretty obvious to see we'd have impact on the industry.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial: Okay, fair enough and then can you also just give us the tenants per tower at quarter end? Thanks.
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: 2.5.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Brett Feldman with Lehman Brothers. Go ahead please.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Thanks for taking the question. Actually just a quick follow up that we had last one, did you disclose the total number of actual tenants you have?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Kurt.
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: It was 16,851.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Alright. And then I just want to go back over, you talked about the impact of the residual AT&T-Cingular churn. can you just clarify the 11% of the entire revenue growth and 14% same tower cash flow growth, did that include the negative impact of that churn or was that exclusive?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: That was excluded.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: So, what would have or what the impact?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Probably about a point or less.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and then this is my last question here. There was a sizeable transaction that you guys would not involve with. I'll certainly give you talk about the types of characteristics that you look for when you are looking to buy assets?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well you shouldn't assume that because we didn't participate in that transaction, we didn't like it. We... as that transaction was put into the market, we were well along with our Light Tower and Optasite transactions and also that particular transaction big churn. However, the one you are referring to was all cash and would have put our leverage position above where we would have wanted to be. Brett, so for all those reasons, we took a path. But based on our understanding there is some well located immature assets involved there that we think Kurt and we'll do pretty well over time.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. Well thank you for your color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Korch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Brad Korch - Credit Suisse: Hi good morning. I just have one last question, most have been taken. On your two acquisitions you did in the quarter, can you talk at all about the profile of towers, the average number of tenants and what number of tenants they can support and if you would need to upgrade those at all to lease up? Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, those two deal for Light Tower and the Optasite deals have asset quality profiles very similar to SBA. You know, independents owned and operated tower companies, put their portfolios together through a combination of buying and building, built for capacity, bought for capacity. Light tower I believe was a 2.1 and Optasite 2.4. Although those numbers were in the press releases if I mistake those. And we think that they will perform similarly to our existing portfolio in terms of lease-up rate, low expense to maintain and low expense to augment.
Brad Korch - Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: A little different than the TowerCo deal, where we bought it at a very immature stage of portfolio growth.
Brad Korch - Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will go to Gray Powell from Wachovia. Go ahead please go ahead.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just had a few quick ones; can you talk about the assumptions that drive the difference between a high end and low end of your guidance range for 2008 on site rent for revenue, because if I back out acquisition revenue, it looks like your implied Q4 estimates what appears to be very conservative.
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well model out really to the dollar, Gray and then we assign a high and a low to that, basically to make sure from the conservative perspective that we always hit our guidance. The main drivers of what will drive lease-up for the rest of the year is Q1-Q2, maybe what we are doing now. But if you leased, if you sign up leases really after pretty very much today you are not going to hit the 2008 financial statements. So we continue to model a conservative rate of lease-up which we beat in the second quarter and there is certainly a chance that we could beat it going forward. But in terms of the drivers, what purely has driven the guidance provisions this time is substantially the acquisitions, a little bit of our Q2 results. But if people are extrapolating or trying to... if you are extrapolating a conclusion that would be well projecting lease up to decline, that's absolutely wrong. We are not projecting that in the slightest.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay, thanks Kurt. That makes a lot of sense. And then, if I just look at your Q3 guidance, it appears that leasing demand remained solid. So I may... I don't' want to get too far into carrier specifics, but can you just talk about whether you are seeing a change in the split of demand that's being driven by new tenants versus amendments? And can you talk about there is any change in the mix that's driven by emerging carriers versus the traditional big four?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's pretty stable. And over the last year or two, I think at we've gone 20%, 19%, 20% on amendments up to 30%, and obviously a lot of we're seeing from AT&T and T-Mobiles on the amendment side, what we're seeing from most of the others, its more on the new lease side. We had a big new lease quarter in Q2 which is the reason why we're at the low end of the amendment side, although amendments were very still good. New leases were just very, very good. So, I think as you kind of project forward, you'll see a mix of new leases from... and amendments from T-Mobile and AT&T. Similar risk with Verizon although they tend to be more on the mix of new tenant leases, and obviously when we get to Clearwire and a reinvigoration of Sprint, Clearwire will be more on the lease, Sprint should be a mix of both and both and most of material I will leave, at this point it's all new leases.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay. And that just really brings into my last question. I know that the Clearwire-Sprint deal hasn't closed yet. Have you had much preliminary discussions with them? And then you kind of mentioned that how should we think about it next year? Is Clearwire going to be a simple augmentation in case if the Sprint is already on the tower? Or will they be treated as a brand new tenant paying the full rent?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it's unclear yet. I think from a legal separation, they will be written as new tenancies, depending on how much additional equipment they will be share will drive the rates and that's still being worked out at this point. But there is a lot of action going on now, a lot of activity, a lot of preliminary discussions. We think when the merger closes there is going to be a ton of business to be done but I don't know if any of that will show up in our 2008 financial results.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Gray.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have Jonathan Schildkraut with Jeffery. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jeffries & Company, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. Most of them have been pretty well blanketed here. But I would like to see a few... if you can give us some commentary on international market, it seems like you're scaling up very well in the United States. All of your focus has been here as you start to approach more than 8000 towers. Would you just continue to focus on the United States or would you also look to the markets outside? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. We will ultimately look to markets outside the U.S., our corporate world, we believe the business model can be taken outside the U.S. Obviously, we'll be careful about where we go and what we do and look at risk adjusted returns and make sure that everything is consistent with maximizing equity free cash flow per share growth. But it is something that over time, you should assume that we will be evaluating.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jeffries & Company, Inc.: Great. One final question, in the footnotes around your guidance, you indicated that certain acquisition-related costs which are currently capitalizing a lot have to be expensed beginning in 2009. Obviously this is a big year for acquisitions, but order of magnitude how should we think about the EBITDA impacts for '09 based on this change of accounting?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, a lien item in our income statement will be labeled specifically as acquisition-related expenses and we will back that out of our definition of adjusted EBITDA that will be there for people to see. The order of magnitude for the first six months of the year was about $6 million.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jeffries & Company, Inc.: Thank you very much for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And Mr. Stoops, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great Cathy. Well thanks to everyone for tuning in and we've got a lot of closings and asset acquisitions between now and our next call, and we look forward to reporting our progress then. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for a replay after noon today through midnight Monday, August 18th.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to our first speaker Pam Kline, Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President of Capital Markets: Thank you for joining us this morning for SBA's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Here with me to today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kurt Bagwell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Macaione, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I need to get the standard SEC disclosure out. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2008 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, particularly those set forth in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results, and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, May 1, 2008, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and the other information required by Regulation G has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com. Tony, would you please get us started with comment on the first quarter results?
Anthony J. Macaione - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Pam and good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release last night, our first quarter financial results were excellent. And we were at the high end or above our guidance for site leasing revenues, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, and equity free cash flow. Total revenues were $109.9 million, up 14.7% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $89.4 million or a 16.8% increase over the first quarter of 2007. This leasing revenue growth was driven by both organic growth and acquisition. Site leasing segment operating profit was $67.3 million. Site leasing contributed 96.6% of our total segment operating profit for the first quarter. Tower cash flow for the first quarter of 2008 was $67.7 million or a 21.4% increase over the year earlier period. Tower Cash Flow margin was 77.5%, up 230 basis points over the year earlier period and 100 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2007. Our services revenues were $20.5 million, compared to $19.3 million in the year earlier period, or a 6.4% increase. Services segment operating profit was $2.4 million in the both the first quarter of 2008 and in the first quarter of 2007. Services segment operating profit margins were 11.5% in the first quarter, compared to 12.5% in the year earlier period. SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $10.5 million including non-cash compensation charges of 1.4 million and one-time net benefits of approximately $900,000 associated with a reduction of certain accruals that were originally recorded at estimated amounts. This compares to SG&A expense of $10.8 million in the year earlier period including non-cash compensation charges of $1.4 million. Other non-cash expenses in the first quarter included in other-than-temporary impairment charge of $2.5 million related to certain auction rate securities held at March 31, 2008. As discussed in our previous earnings call, company still holds three auction rate securities with a par value of $29.8 million which had a fair value of $11.8 million at March 31, 2008. Net loss during the quarter was $14.6 million, compared to a net loss of $16.4 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the first quarter was $0.13, compared to a net loss of $0.16 in the year earlier period. Excluding the $2.5 million non-cash impairment charge on the auction rate securities, our net loss per share would have been $0.11. Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 108.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 08, which excludes certain items such as described in last night's press release was $61.5 million in the first quarter, or a 25.4% increase over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 56.9%, up from 52.5% in the year earlier period. Once again, equity free cash flow increased materially in the quarter, reflecting strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Equity free cash flow for the current period was $38.3 million, a 54.6% increase over the year earlier period. Equity free cash flow per share for the current period was $0.35 per share, or a 52.2% increase over the year earlier period. In the first quarter, we acquired 88 towers, built 20 towers and ended the quarter with 6,325 towers owned and the rights to manage approximately 4,400 additional or potential communication sites. Cash capital and expenditures in the first quarter were 58.7 million, of which we spent 1 million on maintenance tower CapEx, $1.1 million on augmentations and rebuilds and 200,000 on general corporate CapEx. We also spent $47.3 million of cash on acquisitions and earn-outs and $6.1 million on new tower builds and new build work-in-process. With respect to the land underneath our by towers, we spent in total $4.4 million in cash to buy land and easement and to extend ground lease terms. And at this point, I'll turn things over to Pam to provide you with an update on our liquidity and balance sheet.
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President of Capital Markets: Thanks, Tony. SBA ended the first quarter with $1.555 billion of commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates outstanding, $350 million of 0.375% convertible senior notes, $40.0 million outstanding on our $335 million senior credit facility, $and 162.7 million of cash and short term restricted cash for a net debt of 1.8 billion. We increased our senior credit facility to $335 million from $285 million during the quarter. We did not issue stock in the first quarter for acquisition and our share count at the end of the quarter was 108.5 million. The company's net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times at March 31, 2008, down materially from the 8.0 leverage ratio at December 31, 2007. Our net secured debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 5.8 times. Our auction rate securities are not included in our calculation of liquidity or net debt. As of quarter-end, all but $40 million of our debt was fixed rates with a weighted average cash coupon of 4.9% per year. Our first quarter cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest was a very strong 2.8 times compared to 2.2 times in the year earlier period. As of the date of our press release, we had total availability of $227 million under our credit facility, $20 million outstanding, remaining availability of $207 million; as we build and buy towers, additional availability is created under the credit facility. Pro forma for the TowerCo and other transactions under signed purchase contracts, we estimate that the total availability under the facility will be approximately $310 million. We anticipate using a combination of cash on hand and draws from the credit facility to fund our closing obligations for such acquisitions. I will now turn it over to Kurt to discuss some of our operational results.
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Pam and good morning. As you can see by the numbers, Q1 was a very good quarter for us, it continued to show the steady lease up and the resulting revenues from our desirable tower space, a consistent and predictable nature of our expenses, and the efficiency of our scale through the high yet steadily increasing gross margins. Most of our major customers were busy leasing tower space from us in the quarter. We expect this level of activity to continue. So far this quarter, wireless carriers have continued to report excellent operational and financial results for both voice and especially data services, which we believe will continue to lead them down the path of continuing network development. Same tower revenue and tower cash flow growth was strong at 10% and 13% respectively on a cash basis, excluding approximately 130 basis points of Cingular/AT&T merger related de-commissioning. In the first quarter, our churn rate was well below historical levels, representing only 0.2% of revenue on an annualized basis with the majority of this Cingular/AT&T churn now behind us. Rented space earned in our average cash basis rent across our 15,726 tenants, is now up to $1,828 per month. During the first quarter, 80% of our new revenues signed came from new tenant leases, with the other 20% coming from amendments to existing installations. The new leases came from a mix of big 4 carriers and new and existing regional carriers, the mix of new lease activity has been widespread from geographic coverage expansion, to performance enhancing cells, technology overlays, into cover and building penetration, and capacity needs. Wireless backhaul is also gaining momentum and we are starting to see what we think is a broader, long term movement towards that medium from several of our major customers. Backup tower continued to be an active area for our clients and the rental of additional ground space for their variety of solutions has been steady. Our new tower build team completed 20 towers during the quarter, putting them on track to have their best year since the restart of this program a couple of years ago. We are also very busy on the acquisitions side, which Jeff will discuss in more detail. On the operational side of our tower portfolio, both OpEx and CapEx expenses continue to be low and reflect the high quality of our portfolio. The biggest highlight of our expense story continues to be the low rate of occurrence of a structural upgrade being required when we go to approve a new tenant lease application, upgrades to our towers are required in only about 1 out of 15 cases which we believe to be by far the lowest rate among the major tower owners in the industry. As a result, augmentation expenditures for the quarter averaged less than $750 per tower per year. Our maintenance capital expenditures for the quarter also averaged less than $700 per tower per year. Lastly in the expense area, the percentage of our tower sites for which we owned or controlled for more than 50 years, the underlying land grew to 25% as of March 31st contributing to our strong margins and increased control of our assets. Our tower cash flow margins grew 230 basis points year-over-year to 77.5%. On the services side of our business, Q1 came in with revenues and gross margins as expected, revenue of $20.5 million was up 6% year-over-year and segment operating profit of $2.4 million was virtually flat year-over-year on total dollar basis. We performed services work for a variety of carrier customers in the first quarter. We're anticipating that our work for one particular carrier which has been a primary services customer for the last several quarters will be less than the second quarter and thereafter for an unknown period of time. Our second quarter and full year services revenue guidance reflect this lower expectation, which is carrier specific. Those of our services personnel impacted by this carrier's level of activity are in the process of transitioning into other work. On the bright side, there is plenty of network development services workout there from a wide variety of existing and potential SBA customers as evidenced by our high leasing backlogs. We're looking forward to another good year operationally. At this point, I'll turn things over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Kurt, and good morning everyone. We had very good quarter, which we believe sets us up for a very good year. We continue to benefit from an execute-well on our three part strategy to grow equity free cash flow per share, maximize organic growth, grow the portfolio materially through intelligent use of capital and appropriately leveraging the balance sheet. The strategy continues to work well for us as evidenced by our industry leading year-over-year growth in equity free cash flow per share of 52%. We intend to stick with our strategy and believe that it will continue to produce material growth in equity free cash flow per share. As you heard from Kurt, most of our customers have been very active leasing space on our towers; our new tenant lease application backlog is at a recent high and is one of the drivers behind our increased full year outlook. We do not need a new Sprint-Clearwire WiMAX network to achieve our 2008 outlook although obviously it would be welcome and could add to the results depending on the timing. We see no evidence that our customers are cutting back on network investment because of the general economy. Long-term, the prospects for continued strong growth of demand are very good. UMTS overlays will extend in 2009 and perhaps beyond. AWS new market launches will extend into 2009 and most 700 megahertz deployments will not start until 2009 at the earliest. We do believe that Sprint and Clearwire separately or together will develop a WiMAX network. Based on the amount of money spent on the 700 megahertz option and the first quarter results of some of our customers, it appears that we have entered a new phase of wireless growth that of data services, data transmissions typically required greater network densities. We have been the beneficiary of that trend and expect to continue to be a beneficiary for years to come. In summary, organic demand remains strong and we expect it to stay that way. We've taken that strong organic customer demand and have officially converted it into cash flow through our high quality assets and strong operational execution. Obviously 10% same tower revenue growth demonstrates the attractiveness of our towers to wireless providers, but it is also the low cost expense structure of our portfolio that Kurt highlighted that equally drives equity free cash flow. We focus particularly hard on asset selection and operational execution, and we believe our results prove out the success of our efforts. We continue to benefit from the high quality of our towers and the fact that the substantial majority of our portfolio was built by our industry for our industry. Going forward, we believe there will be continued strong demand from our customers for our towers and that the quality of our assets and the strength of our execution will allow us to efficiently convert top line demand for SBA tower space into recurring cash flow. We've had a great start to the year on the second part of our strategy, which is portfolio growth. We announced the TowerCo transaction where we have agreed to buy up to 444 towers, and through today, we have acquired or agreed to acquire an additional 263 towers from a variety of sellers. Combined with the towers we expect to build, we expect to add over 700 towers to the portfolio this year which will be portfolio growth of 11.25%, well above the high end of the portfolio growth range we established at the beginning of the year. This is another reason why we have increased our full year outlook. We are thrilled with the TowerCo transaction and believe those assets to be one of the highest quality, highest growth portfolios of size available or likely to be available for the foreseeable future. We expect to pay approximately 22 times run rate tower cash flow at closing for the towers not to exceed $450,000 per tower. While the multiple is on the high-end of what we typically pay, we believe it is more than justified by the quality cost-per-tower and expected growth of the assets. At closing, the portfolio will average less than 1.5 telephony tenants per tower, with an average capacity for four and average age of approximately three years and approximately $20,000 of run rate tower cash flow per tower. The addition of one telephony tenant per tower over the next five years which we believe is a conservative projection and would only bring the assets up to our existing level of occupancy would more than double tower cash flow produce internal rates of return about 15% and would produce same tower revenue growth and same tower cash flow growth in excess of our portfolio as a whole. We are very pleased with all the real estate and structural aspects of the towers and it is very clear that the portfolio was built and assembled by very experienced and knowledgeable team. Customer demand for the towers is strong; we expect the transaction to be accretive to equity free cash flow per share starting in the fourth quarter of 2008, and be much more accretive in 2009 and beyond. We have been working diligently on the transactions and are on track to close by May 30, 2008. As to the other towers we have bought this year or have under contract to acquire, we are paying a wide range of multiples of run rate tower cash flow ranging from 9 times to 23 times, depending on the price and the growth prospects of the tower with an average of approximately 17 times and $500,000 per tower. Besides acquisitions, we continue to be and intend to stay active as possible building towers for our ownership and buying the land underneath our towers. For the rest of the year, we will continue to look at additional acquisition opportunities, but given that we will exceed our portfolio growth goals by closing what we currently have under contract, we will have the luxury of being very selective. Given our current capitalization, we may have an appetite for up to an additional $100 million of cash acquisitions. There are a number of additional opportunities we are pursuing, but none of those are signed or are in our outlook, and even if they were signed and closed this year, they may have little to no impact on 2008 financial results depending on the timing of closing. They would of course have full impact in 2009. The $100 million of additional potential investment is driven by where such amount of cash acquisitions would put us at year-end in terms of desired and projected leverage and liquidity. And it's a good segue to the third part of our strategy, appropriately leveraging the balance sheet. We enjoyed a material drop in leverage in the first quarter seven-tenths of a turn due to strong current quarter organic growth and the impact of a full quarter of results from our fourth quarter 2007 strong lease-up and portfolio additions. At 7.3 times, net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage, we are in the middle of our target range of six to eight times and at the lowest leverage levels since right before we purchased AAT two years ago. The magnitude of the leverage reduction in the first quarter really demonstrates the operational ability of the business to handle leverage and reaffirms our comfort around target leverage. With adjusted EBITDA, the net interest coverage of 2.8 times and primarily fixed rate debt, we're very comfortable operationally with our debt service. Looking forward, the TowerCo and other second quarter acquisitions will return leverage to approximately 8.0 times at the end of the second quarter and in the sevens on a pro forma basis as we will only have approximately one month of TowerCo in second quarter actual results. After that, given our strong leasing backlog and our positive views around future customer demand, we expect to resume reducing leverage rapidly. If we spent the extra $100 million I have discussed earlier on as yet unannounced acquisitions in the second half of the year, our models indicate that we would end the year with fourth quarter annualized leverage in the low to mid seven times range depending on the timing of the closings with pro forma leverage even lower and with year-end liquidity including credit facility availability estimated to be between 150 million and $200 million. We believe that would be a very good position on which to end the year and move into 2009. If we don't spend the extra $100 million, year-end leverage would be even lower and liquidity higher. Either way, we would have materially grown the portfolio and materially reduced leverage in the same year. Given the speed at which the business organically de-levers, we are studying whether we should access additional debt capital in 2008 to maintain leverage at eight times. Operationally, the business can obviously handle the leverage. The debt markets, however, while recently improved, are still very challenging. Given all of our expected portfolio growth this year, we have the luxury of being able to be very selective around additional debt and as a result we are taking a wait-and-see approach to the debt markets. We're going to continue to monitor conditions, maintain a state of readiness and stay flexible if a good opportunity comes our way. This is the key, a good opportunity, because we don't need to raise any additional capital to achieve our goals this year or grow the portfolio again next year. In the last couple of years, we have been very successful with the rate and terms on which we have accessed debt capital. Any additional debt that we have added has been carefully evaluated on the basis of impact on equity free cash flow per share, covenants, and refinancing risk. We will perform the same analysis today with particular emphasis on the impact to our 2010 and 2011 refinancing obligations. We would only be interested in raising additional debt if it had a neutral to positive impact on the 2010 and 2011 refinancing. In the currently challenging debt markets, we may or may not find an opportunity that satisfies our goals. If we do find such an opportunity, we may seize it, if we don't, we are perfectly content to finish the year with the capital structure we currently have as we will have exceeded our portfolio growth goals for 2008 and still be positioned for material portfolio growth and additional de-leveraging in 2009. That's the update on our three part strategy, it's working very well, and equity free cash flow per share is growing materially. We had a great first quarter, one that was ahead of our expectations. We are in excellent financial shape and our customers are busy. We are extremely excited about our prospects for the future, and we are grateful to being in the business we are in, as we look at how some other businesses are faring in this economy. I want to thank all of our customers and our employees for their role in our success; and for our shareholders we intend to channel our excitement into continued strong execution and growth in equity free cash flow per share and look forward to reporting future results. Linda, at this time we are ready for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Jonathan, pardon me, Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, good morning. Couple of questions, in the earnings release it talked about the backlog of site leasing applications being at a multi year high and I wonder, either Jeff or Kurt, if you could comment at the speed at which you're converting applications to actual revenue, any differing trend there? And then just a couple of house keeping items, if you could repeat the run-rate tower cash flow per tower on the tower code assets as well as in the SBA portfolio the number of leases at quarter end and the average lease rates.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: The application conversions Jonathan is still pretty much the same, we haven't seen a speed up or slowdown there. I mean typically, from the time something hits, I mean we turn things around in 48 hours, but by the time that ultimately gets signed up by a carrier, you know, it may be a month or so depending on how quickly they want to move. Some want to move quicker than others, but in general, I think the averages are still the same. So I don't think there has really been any change there in terms of speed, but there has been an up-tick in volume. Kurt, you want to go back over the --
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Jonathan, 15,726 tenants at $1,828 per month. That's what you were looking for?
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Yes.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: And the tower code TCF run rate at closing, Jonathan, is expected to be approximately 22 times at $20,000 of run rate tower cash flow.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Great. And then the... I think you talked about the CDMA... the steady level at one CDMA carrier affecting the services business and has leasing activities from that carrier slowed down as well?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think we said CDMA.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Oh I am sorry.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: But, yes, I think that of... when we talk about robust carrier activity, it's not generally uniform and that your question was headed in the right direction.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then, any comments on any changes in the sales or operations organization. I think you're hiring a National Director of Sales. I am assuming that's in the services business, but if you could, kind of update us on that?
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, we are just adding some depth there and trying to maintain our momentum in that business. It's obviously a very competitive business and one that you have to work on your sales and your backlog everyday and nothing more than that.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it's a personnel issue and it's not a change in direction or outlook or view.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then finally with regard to the 700 megahertz auction, is there any anticipation that you will be seeing lease applications from any regional build outs as a result of 700 megahertz?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: This year?
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: This year, yes?
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Potentially, it's a little early to say but potentially that could happen in some pockets, I think.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Clayton Moran from Stanford Group. Please proceed.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Group: Good morning. Two areas I want to ask about, first, on the guidance, can you just confirm that that includes pending acquisitions and that therefore the increase in EBITDA is due, about 6 million of it is due to the acquisitions? And then secondly, I think for Kurt, talked about maintenance CapEx down to about 700,000 per tower per year do you think that's a good run-rate, $700 I mean and then, can you talk about the tower portfolio in general that you currently have, the average age, the life of the tower that you expect, the tenants per tower and the total capacity per tower? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes the guidance, Clay, your right I don't know if it's 60% acquisitions, it might more be 50-50, but it is a mix of both organic growth and acquisitions.
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Maintenance CapEx, Clay, I don't foresee a major change in that line item. I mean it fluctuates every quarter up and down a little bit but there is nothing in there that we spend money on that I foresee dramatically changing on an ongoing basis.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think we've been running $700,000 to $800,000 on a run rate basis per year for a couple years now. In terms of the overall portfolio Clay, it's 2.5 tenants per tower, about 2.0 telephony tenants per tower, overall capacity continues to be between four and five telephony tenants per tower, so we estimate that we're about 40% utilized with 60% remaining capacity. Which ties in directly to some of these low numbers that Kurt mentioned, we just have a lot of capacity left that doesn't require any money to fill, and the average age of our towers is, and this will be a guess, I would guess probably 5, 5ish years on average.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Group: And do you, what do you expect life of a tower is at this point now that we're a little more mature in this business do you have any sense for how long the average will last?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well I think its 30 years plus.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Group: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line Jonathan Schildkraut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jefferies & Company: All right, thank you for taking the questions. Just to follow-up on some of the earlier questions, in terms of the higher level of applications we had heard from one of you peers that Sprint had been doing a number of applications around its WiMax deployment, just kind of getting set for rolling that out, potentially either this year or next year, I was wondering if you had seen any activity along those lines? And then also if you could give us little bit more color, if you are seeing any activity from the wireless backhaul guys and how significant it is at this point, additionally what the rental rates on that type of deployment versus traditional telephony deployment might look like? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Jonathan as to your first question we would say some, but we don't really get into carrier specifics. On the second question we are definitely seeing an uptick in wireless backhaul from carriers that we had not historically seen a year or two ago. So that's up and the way that we are benefiting from that increased activity is to rent out additional tower space for microwave dishes and the rate on those leases varies depending on the size of the microwave dish, where they want to place it on the tower, what... where the tower is located. How much room is left, so it could vary from $150 a month to over $500 a month. But clearly an uptick in that type of business for us and one that we believe will continue to trend positively as carriers continue to search for data backhaul solutions.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jefferies & Company: Great, in terms of the expected decrease in development revenues, it sounds like it would be a little bit more on the construction side, rather than consulting side, is that correct?
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Generally, I mean that's 80% of the business anyways and it's always the bigger driver of the numbers.
Jonathan Schildkraut - Jefferies & Company: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jason Armstrong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot, good morning. Couple of questions, first, we came into the year saying 08 was sort of a cash year, in terms of deals, and you've spent a lot of time obviously talking about capacity under the credit facility. I am just wondering, given the pace of deals, you are talking about 700 plus and odds are it moves higher than that, the improved equity currency you are working with, should we expect at least a partial equity component as we go into the back half of the year on some of these deals? And then second question, any comments around potential cost savings from the TowerCo acquisition? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll tackle the last one first, when we have guided with respect to TowerCo it's fully in anticipation of all the synergies that we will enjoy there. That is a transaction that's essentially an asset transaction in nature, where we will not be bringing over any overhead in connection with that transaction. We will probably need to add two maybe three people to the company out in the field and maybe one on the sales side, just as we grow our portfolio because we kind of view those functions as on a per person per number of towers function, but that would be it. So very, very little, almost total drop down to the EBITDA line as a result of that transaction and we'll see on the equity side, we have it like where our stock price was early in the year and we did have the cash available to us. I don't know that people should count on that going forward. But again they shouldn't be surprised by it either and our guiding light there will be the same as it's always been, if this is a deal that should be done or in some cases if it's required to be done by the seller for tax reasons to be stock and it makes good sense for us from an equity free cash flow per share basis, we'll do it.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Charlie Matelo sitting in for Ric. On the M&A front, are seller expectations moderating, given that the capital market still remain challenging?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, a little bit... a little bit they are. I think some of the opportunities that are available at all are available because operators have decided that the capital isn't available for them to continue to grow their companies and execute their plans, so it has caused some folks to think about selling who might not have otherwise done that and I do think expectations are slowly starting to come down as people understand that it's a different credit market environment out there.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And other than the TowerCo portfolio which you gave us some pretty good detail on, in general like, how mature are the towers that you are looking at acquiring?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well they would be probably 1.5 to 1.6 maybe 1.7 tenants on average, a little bit more mature than the TowerCo assets. Hence the higher price per tower and the lower multiple but still well below our existing portfolio averages and of the same time type towers such as we believe that the growth on those towers in the future, will exceed portfolio growth as a whole.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, that's helpful. That's it from me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Thanks for taking the question, actually it's a follow-up on the last one. The types of assets that you are looking at, can you sort of describe where they are in other words are you primarily looking at putting more towers in markets where you already have operations, are you trying to branch out into new areas, are you getting into areas that you never thought you might go to because you see demand? And then you talked about having confidence, that you will be able to lease these assets out, how do you get that confidence, is it simply based on the number of operators in the market or is there something more sophisticated that you do?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, its 20 years of being in the network development business, that's first and foremost and a pretty good understanding of what is a good tower, and what carriers will look for and it's not really, Brett so much geographic focus as it is focusing on the assets themselves. I mean there are so many places in this country where a well located, well protected tower will do extremely well over time and those are the types of assets that we are looking for. We are looking for high growth assets that are in spots where carriers are going to need to be, but not necessarily have been there yet. And with the increased density that we've seen the trends over the last couple of years and particularly now with data, that strategy has really served us well.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Do you see any strategic value in increasing the density of your towers in specific market because some of your larger peers are able to do like large volume deals, because they happened to have a lot of presence in the market, is that something you're doing, it's something you want to do and is that factored into your acquisition strategy?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, it's not something that we have pursued, with those large volume deals typically come other strengths attached and that's not... we have tended to price our assets and want to continue to price our assets on a tower-by-tower basis. So that's not really a strategy, perhaps that we persuade more neither I think we will be pursuing.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thanks for taking the question.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Gray Powell from Wachovia. Please go ahead.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Thanks, good morning everybody. Just had a few quick questions, the statistics you gave on the tower company acquisition were actually very helpful. Can you just talk about the tenant demand for those properties that you're seeing today, relative to what you are seeing under your core portfolio?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Oh, it's about the same, it's strong.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay. Because it does seem like a point to BBE lease operate I mean on a base of 1.5 tenants that implies that the revenue growth is significantly higher?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: We believe it will be.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay. And then obviously there has been a lot of talk about the potential Sprint-Clear wire WiMax joint venture. If a deal were announced, just how quickly, do you think that you'd be able to get leases signed and start generating the incremental revenue on your towers?
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: I think very quickly, there has been a large amount of preparatory work that has been done by both of those customers in the last year to 18 months. So they theoretically have the ability to step right in and move fairly quickly.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay, and then my last question, is that in the press release you stated that the backlog of tenant leases, is at a multi-year high. I thought that was particularly impressive just given that the Sprint has curtailed their spending so far in this year. So is there any one area in particular that you can point to that's offsetting that? Or is there any way that you can quantify the upside that you are seeing today?
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Everybody else is very busy. I mean it's really... I can't really signal on anyone particular contributor above the rest, but it's just a very good level of overall activity that we are seeing. Not only on the lease... when we talk about backlog, that's really just the new tenant leases. It's also on the amendment side with all the UMTS overlays still going on. So we really do feel good about the additional business prospects for the rest of the year.
Gray Powell - Wachovia: Okay, all right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thanks very much. Good morning. If I could come back to the wireless backhaul topic, is there anyway to help us sort of size the opportunity, what percentage of revenues today are from wireless backhaul? What sort of year-over-year growth rates are you seeing in revenues from wireless backhaul? Anything like that and then in terms of what's driving it, obviously the demand for data is driving it, but is it that the backhaul facilities the copper, the T1s whatever are either... there's not enough capacity going to the towers that people want to or just the pricing is so high that it's forcing people to look to alternative mechanisms? Thanks.
Kurt L. Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Simon, I can address the last piece of the question. It's really a combination of capacity and cost of that current and backhaul that's been offered, and the data services you are pushing, the bandwidth requirements to the extreme in a lot of cases and we are seeing carriers that need 10s of TI backhaul of the site. I mean, I think some of the minimum sites now with a lot of big core carriers have 4 to 6 T1s of backhaul to start with and it goes straight up from there usage. And so a lot of the wireless backhaul we're seeing put in is by the carriers directly, we're still seeing a good bit of third party, wireless backhaul put in and a lot of it is from the carrier directly and they are reaching that cross over point where they can carry the traffic themselves, the cross over point between the CapEx and the OpEx. And once they put in a system themselves, they can scale that capacity very well, the systems that are offered today are very high capacity and scaleable and they are just reaching that cross over point.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, in terms of the magnetite of the current activity, I mean we don't have a exact numbers fully on that Simon, but just off top of my head given some of the new folks that have already appeared on that front in the last 12 months, I would say on trailing 12 months basis what we've seen... this most current 12 month is two or three times the level of microwave applications that we saw over the preceding 12 month period.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We now go to line of Brad Korch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Brad Korch - Credit Suisse: Hi, thanks for taking questions. Just one last follow-on on the site leasing backlog. With the higher than expected backlog have you seen any changes in pricing trends with respect new leases, are you able to raise prices at all? And then on the demand that you are seeing, is there any specific region or any specific type of market top 100 or not on top 100? Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: The demand is pretty well spread across the entire portfolio, it's definitely not concentrated. And in terms of pricing, we continue to see prices being very steady and on apples-to-apples, year-over-year basis we're probably seeing mid-single digit increases on new lease applications.
Brad Korch - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time; I will turn it back to you.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great. We appreciate everyone dialing in today for our update, and we look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you. Thank you.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing-by. Welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we would conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to our host and Vice President of Capital Markets, Ms. Pam Kline. Please go ahead.
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President, Capital Markets: Thank you for joining us this morning for SBA's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Here with me to today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kurt Bagwell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Macaione, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I need to get the standard SEC disclosure out. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2008 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, particularly those set forth in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results, and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, February 22, 2008, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and the other information required by Regulation G, is included in our earnings press release, which has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com. Tony, would you comment on our fourth quarter results, please?
Anthony J. Macaione - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Pam and good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release last night, our fourth quarter financial results were excellent. We move at the end or above our guidance to leasing revenues, tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, and exceeded the mid point of our guidance on equity free cash flow. Total revenues were $108.9 million, up 12.6% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $84.7 million, or 13.8% increase over the fourth quarter of 2006. This leasing revenue growth was driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Site leasing segment operating profit was $62.9 million. Site leasing contributed 95.4% of our total segment operating profit in the fourth quarter. Total cash flow for the fourth quarter 2007 was $63.2 million or a 17.3% increase over the year earlier period. Total cash flow margin was 76.5%, up 170 basis points over the year earlier period. Our services revenue were $24.2 million compared to $22.3 million in the year earlier period. Services revenues were up 9% sequentially from the third quarter of 2007. Our services segment operating profit was $3 million compared to $2.6 million in the year earlier period. Services segment operating profit margins were 12.5% in the fourth quarter, up from 11.8% in the year earlier period. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $11.9 million including non-cash compensation charges of $1.4 million. This compares to SG&A expense of $10.8 million in the year earlier period including non-cash compensation charges of $1.2 million and one-time AAT integration cost of 500,000. Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by several one time items aggregating approximately 500,000. We expect quarterly cash SG&A expenses to be approximately $10 million for 2008. Other non-cash expenses in the fourth quarter included in other than temporary impairment charge of $15.6 million related to certain auction rate security investments we held at December 31st, 2007. As of December 31st, 2007, the company's short-term investments consisted of nine auction rate securities that had a par value of $70.7 million. Auctions associated with these investments have failed as a result of the lack of demand in the marketplace. The company had not been able to liquidate these securities at par as of December 31, 2007. As a result of the company's assessment of the number of factors including market conditions and the credit quality of serving these securities, the estimated fair vale of some of these investments no longer approximates their par value. Subsequent to December 31st, we sold at par value six of these auction rate securities, which totaled $40.9 million of the company's total par value of $70.7 million. Based on the subsequent sale, these six securities are carried at par value at December 31, 2007. The company still holds three auction rate securities with a par value of $29.8 million and a fair value as of December 31, 2007 of $14.2 million. And we continue to receive interest on these securities monthly. The three remaining auction rate securities are not backed by any CDOs or subprime related assets. They are issued and insured by monoline bond insurers. Given the current state of the credit market and the lack of demand in the marketplace or auction rate securities, we have discontinued purchasing these instruments and have restricted our cash investments to only those that are highly liquid and short-term in nature and a highly rated. Net loss during the fourth quarter was $28.9 million compared to a net loss of $24.3 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the fourth quarter was $0.27 compared to net loss of $0.23 in the year earlier period. Excluding the $15.6 million non-cash impairment charge on the auction rate securities, our net loss per share would have been $0.13. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 106 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2007, which excludes certain items such as non-cash leasing revenue and ground lease expense, non-cash compensation and a non-cash charge on our short-term investments was $56.1 million in the fourth quarter or an 18% increase over the year earlier period. Our adjusted eb1 margin was 52.5%, up from 50.4% margin in the year earlier period. Once again, equity free cash flow increased materially in the quarter, reflecting strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Equity free cash flow for the current period was $33.2 million, a 60% increase over the year earlier period. Equity free cash flow per share for the current period was $0.31 per share or 55% increase over the year earlier period. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 175 towers, built 20 towers and ended the year with 6,220 towers owned and the rights to manage approximately 4,500 additional or potential communication sites. Cash capital expenditures in the fourth quarter was $59.4 million, of which we spent $1.2 million on maintenance power CapEx, $1.9 million on augmentations and new builds and 500,000 on general corporate CapEx. We also spent $45.1 million of cash on acquisitions and earn-outs and $4.2 million on new tower builds and new build work-in-process. With respect to the land underneath our towers, we... in total, we spent $12 million in cash to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. Our ground lease purchase program is going very well and we finished the year significantly ahead of plan, and spent a total of $34.1 million on this program in 2007. At this point, I will turn things over to Pam, who will provide you with an update on our liquidity position in capital structure.
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President, Capital Markets: Thanks, Tony. SBA ended the fourth quarter with $1.555 billion of commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates outstanding, $350 million of 0.375% convertible senior notes, $107.9 million of cash and restricted cash, and net debt of $1.8 billion. We issued 2.9 million shares of our stock in the third quarter, 2.6 million of which were for acquisitions; and our current share count at year end was 108.4 million. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter and our Board authorization to do so expired December 31, 2007. The company's net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 8.0 times at December 31, 2007. Our short-term invests of $55.1 million related to auction rate securities are not included in our calculation of liquidity or net debt, nor are the $40.9 million of cash proceeds we received post-year end, when we sold six of the auction rate securities, which on a pro forma basis would have reduced our leverage ratio below eight times. As of year end all of our debt was fixed rate with a weighted average cash keep on at 4.9%. Our fourth quarter cash interest coverage ratio adjusted EBITDA for net cash interest was a very strong 2.7 times compared to 2.0 times in the year earlier period. In January 2008, we obtained a $285 million senior secured revolving credit facility. This facility has a three year life and allows for borrowings to be used to build or buy towers or for ground lease buyouts. The amounts borrowed under this facility will accrue interest at LIBOR plus a margin, which ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 50 basis points to 200 basis points. The spread to be paid on top of either the LIBOR or the Base Rate will be determined based on certain leverage level calculated at the borrower level. As of today approximately, $183 million is available under the facility of which $20 million has been drawn and is outstanding at a rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points. On a pro forma basis, when you combine the $40.9 million of proceeds from the sale of the auction rate securities with cash and restricted cash at year-end, and the amount currently available under the current credit facility liquidity at December 31st, 2007 would have been approximately $312 million, which we believe puts us in a very strong position. Kurt, would you give us an update on operations?
Kurt Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks Pam, and good morning. As you've heard through the tally of the numbers, the fourth quarter was solid for us at SBA. Our customers very busy with a variety of network build out, growth and enhancement activities and we feel we captured at least our fair share due to the excellent quality of our towers, their locations, and the hard work and diligence of our employee base. More specifically, our incremental tower leasing revenue signed in the quarter was similar to our very successful third quarter in terms of new leases and amendments. This was also our best net lease of course since the AAT acquisition would post AT&T, Cingular churn dropping back to normalized levels. During this time, rent of state farm and our average cash basis rents across all 15,429 leases in our portfolio is up 5% year-over-year to $1,807 per month. During the quarter, 72% of our leasing activity came from new leases while 28% came from amendments to existing installations. With strong activity on the amendment side is from technology overlays, backup tower, wireless backhaul, and other capacity and performance enhancing modifications on the tower and on the ground. We are currently at 2.5 tenants per tower, and this number has been relatively steady as we have continued to build and buy lower maturity towers with high available capacity and excellent growth characteristics. As it is typical at any time during the year and with fourth quarter being no exception, certain carriers are more active than others, but the combined activity level is continued to stay high. Our leasing backhaul is strong as we work through the first quarter of 2008, and we expect the year to get busier as it moves along, and overall to rival or be bigger than 2007. Our new tower build team completed 20 towers during the quarter; their strongest efforts since we restarted the program a couple of years ago and putting that to 61 completed for the year. New tower builds remains very competitive, but we have stayed disciplined with our side-by-side selection, modeling and approval process and our production has been steadily growing. We intend to increase annual new build production over the next several years. We also bought 175 towers during the quarter, which puts us at 612 towers acquired for the 2007 calendar year. The combined growth from these two initiatives put our year-end tower count at 6,220, an increase of 12% over the year ago period. We intend to continue this in 2008 with targeted portfolio growth of 5 to 10% from acquisitions and new builds. On the operational side of our tower portfolio, we continue to take advantage of our large scale. We have been able to successfully operate under a structure, where our expense ratios of personal, ground leases, repairs maintenance, and other cost drivers continues to improve. The percentage of our towers, which we own, are controlled more than 50 years; the underlying land grew to 23.3% as of December 31, contributing to our strong margin growth. We are confident in our ability to maintain a simple low cost structure that is steady and predictable. We expect tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins to continue to grow. Lastly on the services side of our business, we finished off the year in good fashion with highest revenue and profit quarter of 2007. Revenue of $24 million was up 8%; and segment operating profit of $3 million was up 15% over the year earlier period. This capped off a typical seasonal year for services, where each quarter grew busier sequentially than we expect a similar pattern in 2008 for this segment of our business. At this point, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Kurt and good morning everyone. We had a very good fourth quarter, and we are very pleased with the year as a whole. The year 2007 marked the fourth consecutive year of strong organic growth, portfolio growth and balance sheet improvement for SBA. The year played out as we predicted it would with strong carrier activity in the aggregate although not necessarily uniform among the various carriers. We saw more activity in the second half of the year than the first half, which bodes well for our 2008 financial results. We ended the year slightly ahead of expectations on organic leas up, ahead on services gross profit, well ahead on acquisitions and well ahead on ground lease purchases. These results drove our final adjusted EBITDA for the year to the highest in company history. I want to thank our customers and our employees for another very successful year. We think 2008 will also be a good year and similar to 2007 and that we expect to see a strong carrier activity in the aggregate providing us with solid lease up and solid services results. We expect to continue to add quality tower assets and purchase additional lands under our towers. We are progressing well on the acquisition front and feel very good about hitting our 5 to 10% portfolio growth goals. Our acquisition successes and out strong operational lease up in the fourth quarter gives us a good start in 2008; and as a result, we have increased our full year guidance for 2008. At this time, we are projecting another year of material growth in all key metrics, particularly growth in equity free cash flow per share, where we have established ourselves as the clear industry leader. There are a number of factors that we believe will drive continued strong organic growth. Data services from our customers continued to grow, driving carrier revenues and thus requiring additional network investment. There remains a large amount of AWS spectrum to be built including by a number of new market entrants. AT&T and T-Mobile are expected to be busy all year with UMTS upgrades. We expect material network activity out of Sprint although in what form we are quite not sure. Verizon is expected to stay steady. Additionally, Clearwire could turn out to be a positive factor for us later in the year if they resume network development at their early 2007 pace. We just saw this week the introduction of a number of all-you-can-eat voice plans that should require additional network capacity. And then there is the 700 megahertz spectrum option, the benefits from which will even begin to be recognized by the tower industry until 2009. All in all, we believe 2008 will be another good year for carrier activity our organic leasing growth at our services business. We are extremely well positioned to increase our tower portfolio materially again this year primarily for two reasons. First, our new credit facility gives us plenty of attractively priced capital. Second, we see many additional opportunities out there as we believe the current capital markets conditions are causing some, who have been sitting on the fence to decide to sell since our view on future carrier activity and operational growth of these assets remains very positive and we have the capital. We are eager to continue our investments in tower acquisitions when our internal rate of return requirements are met. We continue to see a number of quality high growth tower assets for sale at reasonable accretive prices that meet or exceed our return requirements. Accounting acquisitions transactions currently under contract, we are already over 35% of the way to the high end of our goal of 10% portfolio growth. Under current market prices and conditions, our models tell us that the best use of our discretionary capital is to continue to buy growth assets for cash to maximize future growth and equity free cash flow per share. We believe that this use of capital will produce superior growth and equity free cash flow compared to stock repurchases or acquisitions for stock although both of those uses would also produce good growth in equity free cash flow per share. We will continue to carefully monitor the market to make sure these priorities remain appropriate; and if our conclusions change, we have the ability to change our discretionary spending virtually immediately. We are excited about the future. We have successfully positioned SBA as a fast growth company with high quality assets in a very favorable wireless market. Our customers are very busy and expected to stay busy. We are executing well on our three part strategy of organic growth, portfolio growth, and capital structure management. We are achieving our goal of material growth and equity free cash flow per share. And as you can see from our increased 2008 outlook, we expect 2008 to be another good year for SBA. Tremetria, at this time, I think we are ready for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from the line of Gray Powell with Wachovia. Please go ahead.
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities: Hi guys, good morning.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities: Hey, just had a couple of quick questions. Has anything changed in your outlook for carrier activity overall, or was it mainly the upside in acquisition this quarter then to the upside in your 2008 guidance?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: The increase in the guidance Gray is as a result of the operation lease up in the fourth quarter, which doesn't begin to hit the financials till the first or second quarter of 08. Now it's ahead of our expectations, and it was also ahead of the... also because of the acquisitions and where we are on that front. We are still at this point projecting lease operates at the same rate that we enjoyed overall in 2007.
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities: Great. And can you just talk about the characteristic of some of the acquisitions you are making just in terms of like the tenants per tower and the cash flow margin?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we are still pursuing a wide variety of different types of assets, focusing primarily on the projected returns. But the towers, Gray, range from 2.5 to 3 tenant towers that we are buying for 13 times to one tenant towers that look just like new builds that we are buying over... for over 20 times that where price ranges that go from 3,000 a tower to up to $750,000 or more. So it's very much across the board. But I will give you our full year 2007 kind of averages. We bought towers throughout the entire year at a tower cash flow multiple run rate of 17 times, which we would think is about 15 times forward and at a price per tower of $538,000.
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Well, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brett Feldman with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just real quick and I apologize that you gave these data points; what's the total number of actual tenants you have in your tallies [ph] right now?
Unidentified Company Representative: 2.5.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: That's the average. You know what the total is?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, total tenant count?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes.
Unidentified Company Representative: 15,429.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Thanks. And then also in terms of same tower revenue growth in tower capital growth, you have those stats what they were in the fourth quarter?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, if you take out the Cingular merger churn, revenue was 10% and tower cash flow was 13%.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Great, and then you mentioned the mix between new leases and augmentations, and it looks like it's getting closer to 70-30, I think historically been more 80-20. Are you seeing more... do you think that mix is going to be more representative of what's going to happen in 2008 especially when you consider all the business you are getting augmentation related work like the UMTS overlays, maybe some WiMAX stuff? And if that is the case, are you finding that the augmentations are maybe more revenue intensive than they have historically been?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: We definitely see more augmentations in volume, Brett. Because we think AT&T and T-Mobile in particular will be very busy all year with UMTS overlays. Now we also think we will see a lot of brand new tendencies from a number of players not the least of which will be Metro and Leap, who are only generally new kind of the course in there markets. So whether it changes... whether one of those offsets the other probably don't have a good guess for that right now. But we do expect good augmentation and amendment activity for at least the next several years. And the amount of dollars that we get, it varies; I mean it ranges from the low of 3 to 400 to add a couple of lines over a thousand depending on what's being done out of sight. I am not sure I can generalize for you there.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then one last question on different subject; I think you said that your ability to repurchase shares actually expired at the end of the year, and while it's clear that your primary interest is on acquisition as opposed to buybacks, why not just have another authorization any how? I know you can't use the revolver, but you can still use your cash flow from operations if you thought it's very opportunistic.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we could and it's just the board authorization that we can go to our Board and get at any time if we have good reason and your point is well taken.
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you for taking the questions.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Clay Moran with Stanford Group. Please go ahead.
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial: Good morning. Two questions on the increase in the EBITDA guidance; can you just confirm that about half of that would be from organic sources and half from acquisitions. And then you talked about the credit markets and your... how you're viewing tower acquisitions, and that could change depending on what happens with the credits markets going forward. But can you just give a little more color sort of on how you are looking at it based on what you know today? Do you see this as a real opportunity to scoop up some assets possibly at cheaper prices or are you already a little bit more cautious than you were a year ago? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think it is... your first question, Clay, it is roughly 50-50, maybe 40-60 one way or the other of which I am not sure, but that's close. On the acquisitions, we are... we have... the way we've handled the change in credit markets, yes, we do believe that others will no be as well positioned as we will to access capital and take advantage of the traditionally mom and pop market at least the folks who have traditionally competed against us there. And the way we've kind of worked pricing as we have ticked up our rate of return requirements. And there is a... there are two schools of thoughts as to whether you wait for lower prices or whether you tick up your return requirements and as long as the deals continue to meet those, you move forward, because you really don't know what the future would bring and you are buying stuff that is at or about of where you wanted to be from a return requirement. And we are currently in that ladder camp right now. So we have to cup our return requirements a little bit, which is caused us to probably get better deals than, and we would probably see that as higher growth potentially even though the tower cash flow multiples may be similar to what we pay the year ago, but our projected returns are higher. So that's how we are moving forward and trying to work our way through the current environment.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, good morning guys.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey Rick.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, couple of quick questions for you; one I think for Tony. Did I hear you right on the one timers that actually was a negative $0.5 million impact on EBITDA in the fourth quarter, and is there any one timers forecast for the first quarter; first question?
Anthony J. Macaione - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Rick, this is Tony. There was a $0.5 million in the aggregate and there was a no one individual that I would consider that materials. There were several items that net-net was a negative 500,000. And no, there were not any one timers that were projecting for the first quarter guidance.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, and then on the short-term investment item, given that you guys have fell to [ph] six at the end of the year, but kept three. Should we assume that since these things are still bearing interest, you will not look at to sell these at a loss even though you took the fair market right on it, you would get out of it, but only as they get closer to parse that kind of a thought process?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: That's the current thought process, and we will... one of things that we did and we have taken these things down from $120 million at the end of Q3 to now $29 million, so we have kind of boxed this in. So we are not happy with the $29 million that we still are holding. But it's small enough number now, where we don't have any need to sell at a loss, so we will see what the market does.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Exactly, okay. And then Jeff, as you think about leverage, you guys are eight times excluding that short-term stuff. Now that you have gotten some of that cash back little bit less than eight times. Where do you look at as far as kind of your target leverage range and your thoughts on where it might go?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think we are comfortable at these levels given what we are doing with our capital. I mean a year ago, Rick, I might have been ready to debut a nine times target leverage level, but in light of the credit market conditions, we are comfortable and going to stick with our six to eight and still comfortable at around the high end of that at eight times.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Fair, and then there is a lot of buzz, a week or two or three weeks ago about industry consolidation. How do you think about industry consolidation within the tower space? When does it make sense, does it make sense, is scale important? How do you guys think about the potential for a larger industry consolidation within the tower group?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's certainly possible. Obviously, there will be a lot of SG&A synergies that could come of out of it. I guess the way we think about it is we feel like we are producing superior returns on our independent path through our ability to materially grow equity free cash flow per share at the highest rate in the industry. And would our views change on that? Maybe other things change, but it continues to be and it always has been really a pure financial decision. How you're going to make the most money for your shareholders? Because unlike in other industries, there is really is no strategic reason why consolidation should occur in our industry.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's all financial.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. And then the final question; we heard that whacky Wall Street Journal gas bladder story earlier this week. An idea we have seen flow before or too, but I guess it's an opportune time to touch on less field technologies. Do you guys see anything out there may recur being given for this one as far as smart antennas or DAS [ph] systems or anything else out there that might be a little bit more real than somebody pumping a bunch of hydrogen in a balloon?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Rick, we look at that all the time and we keep up with that pretty well. There is really nothing that I see out there that's looming. That DAS stuff, I would tell you is very real, and it's... we view it as some of complementary though, because it's still typically filling up for you can't get the tower zone. There are things like that. So it's... I think that's the most real technology, but again I view it more as complementary than competitive. And the other stuff is I mean the gas balloon thing is not a worry at all. There is really no... I don't think any capacity in that or anything other than a minor real story. The carriers continue working with the OEM every day to come up with ways to squeak a little more capacity out of the existing bandwidth and product... physical product, but they have been doing that for years. And that's good for them. I mean we need them to stay healthy financially too. So it's a balancing act, but there is really nothing out there that we feel as looming.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And the DAS system would typically be rolled out in a place, where there is no towers any way, I would think.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I mean it's really a filling strategy in a lot of cases.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: For the very, very tough to zone areas?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, or an urban are.
Richard Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, right. Hey, good luck guys.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Richard Choe with Bears Stearns. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Hi, to follow-up on the... some of acquisitions questions. Can you give us a sense on over the past few deals what has changed and what the specific characteristics of the towers were like. If we see this one deal 750 per tower and then a cash deal 440 per tower and this other deal at around 550, 540. Can you give us a little more color on... in terms of cash and equity, the credit markets and equity markets? What kind of drove the different pricing in these field?
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the different pricing was all a function of the maturity of the tower. The current tenants per tower on the tower and where we thought growth would go on that tower over a forward five year period, which we then used to project out what our return requirements are. And if they are met, we move forward and if they are not, we don't. So that's why you get the wide variation in price per tower. It's a function of tenants per tower. So on the... for the full year numbers, I think the average was around 1.5, 1.6 tenants per tower on this stuff that was brought at higher prices, it would have been higher tenancy per tower. The mix on the cash and the stock was... in the fourth quarter, we had a larger transaction. That was driven by the seller, who wanted tax for exchange treatment, so that accounted for most of the stock that we issued. But we also from time-to-time issue stock in acquisitions to balance out our leverage to extend our capital. We went to all cash in 08 as we did not like the price of our stock and with the... now the credit facility in place, we have all the cash we need to continue to go that route as we move forward. But we will keep monitoring things and have the opportunity to use the mix, where we think it's in our best interest to do so. And best interest is all about maximizing growth in equity free cash flow per share.
Richard Choe - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Great, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take the next question from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, good morning. I am curious within CapEx; how much specifically you spent on tower augmentation in the quarter. And then I apologize if these were addressed earlier. But what kind of multiples are you seeing on ground lease purchases? And then with the respect to your 08 guidance, what sorts of 4G or WiMAX related expectations are kind of built in?
Kurt Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: John, this is Kurt. On the tower augmentations, we spent about 1.9 in the quarter gross on that. That was a little higher than typical, but not much. And a lot of that we get back from the carriers and in capital contributions.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Approximately what portion of the time do you have to think about augmenting the tower when you receive the lease application?
Kurt Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, I will tell you, it's not very often. I approve those myself, anything that's substantial. And I mean it's probably one out of 15 or 20, and some of them are small, some of them are little bigger. But it's not a real up from occurrence.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Right.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Ground lease purchases are averaging around 12 times current year's rent, and really there is no WiMAX in the 08 numbers per se, Jonathan. I mean what we did... we really don't do quite as granularly as you might think. We really take a view of the overall lease up numbers from the year that we are in and kind of decide amongst the group and using all the data that we have, is it going to be higher, lower or the same. And there really was obviously no WiMAX in 07. So you could say there is none in... oh, well, that's not true. There was some Clearwire in 07. But whatever they contributed towards our 07 results that would be... all that would be in 08.
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions. First on the auction rate securities; you said obviously sold six at par and you've got a big credit associated with the other three. Can you talk us through I mean to the best of your knowledge, is there any sort of material underlying quality differential between the six that you sold and three that remain? And then second question raising guidance, Jeff, I think you indicated sort of 50-50 split between organic versus acquisitions. On the organic side, is this something you saw exiting 4Q that was relatively broad based across the carriers or there maybe one or two specific customers sort of driving the entry? Thanks.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I will start with the ladder, first. I mean it was really all about the leases and the amendments we signed up in Q4. They were just above of where we thought. So, because those don't head the financial until 08, it was really what's already been done that allowed us to increase a portion of the outlook with the other being acquisitions. And there... it's pretty broad. I mean there is our top four customers in no particular order were AT&T, Metro, T-Mobile, Verizon, both new leases and amendments. So, it's coming from a variety of different spots. I mean there wasn't much Sprint in Q4 as I think everybody knows. And we will see where that heads as we go forward. And clearly there were differences in the auction rate securities on what we are able to sell for par and what we've held on the books and mark down. I mean that's the best basis of the differentiation is an analysis of the underlying securities.
Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Right, okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And with that being said, I will turn it back to the conference room for closing announcement.
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great, thank you. And thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to reporting our first quarter results. Thanks.

Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very for standing by. We do appreciate your patience today while the conference assembled and good morning. Welcome to SBA Communications' announcing their third quarter results. At this point and during managements prepared remarks, we do have all of your phone lines muted or in a listen-only mode, although later there will be opportunities for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  So with that being said, we'll get right to the third quarter agenda. Here with our opening remarks is Vice President of Capital Markets, Ms. Pam Kline. Please go ahead ma'am. 
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President, Capital Markets:  Thank you for joining us this morning for SBA's third quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Here with me to today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kurt Bagwell, our Chief Operating Officer and Tony Macaione, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, I need to get the standard SEC disclosure out. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2007, 2008 and beyond. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, particularly those set forth in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which documents are publicly available. These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today November 2, 2007 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G is included in our earnings press release which has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com.  Tony, would you comment on our third quarter results? 
Anthony J. Macaione - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer:  Thanks Pam and good morning everyone. Before I review with you our third quarter results, I would like to highlight two one-time items that were noted in last evening's earnings press release.  The first item is a one-time non-cash charge to cost of site leasing revenue in the third quarter of 2007 in the amount of $2.5 million arising from the FAS 13 accounting treatment for deferred straight line rent escalation credits related to land acquired or leases expanded to 99 years under the company's ground lease purchase and extension program. In previously reported periods, the company has recorded the release of these deferred straight line rent escalation liabilities as a net reduction to cost of site leasing revenue in our site leasing segment. We are reclassifying this liability as a reduction to the value of the land acquired or amount prepaid to extend the lease. Also, since the $2.5 million charge is non-cash, it has no effect on tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, equity free cash flow or equity free cash flow per share in either the current or previously reported periods.  The second item is a one-time non-recurring site leasing revenue net benefit of $2.2 million recorded in the third quarter of 2006 and discussed a year ago that was a result of the release of certain revenue sharing obligations to which we had accrued liabilities.  I would also like to point out in my following prepared remarks that all references to percentage growth rates between the third quarter of 2007 and 2006 exclude the effect of a $2.2 million one-time and non-recurring site leasing revenue net benefit from the third quarter of 2006. I will be referring to these growth rates as adjusted growth rates.  And now for our third quarter results. As you saw from our press release last night, our third quarter financial results were very solid and we met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance on leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and equity free cash flow. Our total revenues were $103.2 million, up 5.1% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $81 million or a 12% adjusted growth rate increase over the third quarter of 2006. This leasing revenue growth was driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Our site leasing segment operating profit was $56.6 million.  This morning I saw one analyst report that thought our recurring site leasing expenses were up sequentially $3 million over the second quarter. This is not the case. The $3 million was a one-time non-cash charge related to the ground lease accounting. On an apples-to-apples basis, site leasing expenses were up only 3.9% over the year earlier period. Most of that increase was due to having more towers. Also, site leasing after the one-time charge contributed 95.1% of our total segment operating profit in the third quarter.  Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $59.2 million or a 15% adjusted growth rate increase over the year earlier period. Our tower cash flow margin was 75.1%, up from 74.2% in the year earlier period. Our services revenues were $22.2 million compared to $23.8 million in the year earlier period. Services revenues were up 7% from the second quarter. Profitability in the segment improved materially as services segment operating profit was $2.9 million compared to $2.5 million in the year earlier period. Services segment operating profit margins were 13.1% in the third quarter, a strong improvement compared to the 10.5% in the year earlier period.  SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $11.3 million including non-cash compensation charges of $1.5 million. This compares to SG&A expenses of $11 million in the year earlier period including non-cash compensation charges of $1.6 million and a one-time AAT integration cost of $0.5 million.  Net loss was $17.5 million compared to a net loss of $24.3 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the quarter was $0.17.  Our weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were $104.2 million.  Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain items such as non-cash leasing revenue and ground lease expense and non-cash compensation was $52.8 million in the third quarter or a 17% adjusted growth rate increase over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 52.3%, up from 49.4% margin in the year earlier period.  Once again, our equity free cash flow increased materially in the quarter, reflecting strong adjusted EBITDA growth, reduced net cash interest expense and stable non-discretionary capital expenditures. Equity free cash flow for the period was $30.2 million, an 80% adjusted growth rate increase over the year earlier period. Equity free cash flow per share for the current period was $0.29 or at 81% adjusted growth rate increase over the year earlier period.  During the quarter, we acquired 227 towers, we built 17 towers and ended the quarter with 6026 towers either owned outright or the rights to manage over 5600 additional or potential communication sites.  Cash capital expenditures in second quarter were $60.8 million, of which we spent $1.6 million on maintenance tower CapEx, $1.1 million on augmentations and rebuilds and $200,000 on general corporate CapEx. We also spent $54 million of cash on acquisitions, ground lease purchases and earn-outs and $3.9 million on new tower build and new build work-in-process.  With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent in total $6.3 million in cash to either buy land and easements or to extend ground lease terms. Our ground lease purchase program is going very well and we are significantly ahead of plan.  At this point, I am going to turn things over to Pam who is going to provide an update on our capital structure. 
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President, Capital Markets:  Thanks Tony. SBA ended the third quarter with 1.555 billion of commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates outstanding, 350 million of 0.375% convertible senior notes, $197.3 million of cash, restricted cash and short-term investments and a net debt of $1.707 billion. We issued 1.8 million shares of our stock in the third quarter primarily for acquisitions and our share count at quarter end was 105.5 million. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the third quarter. The company's net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 8.1 times at September 30, 2007, the same as where we ended the second quarter and a level at which we are very comfortable in the current environment. All of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average coupon of 4.9%. Our cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest was a very strong 2.6 times compared to 1.9 times in the current year earlier period.  Kurt, would you please give us an update on operations. 
Kurt Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer:  Thanks Pam and good morning. As you have heard, Q3 2007 was solid for us at SBA. Our tower leasing revenues and profits were strong, our services volume and profits continued to grow and our tower asset growth continued to pick up speed as both our M&A and new builds were at higher levels than the recent past.  In addition, the number of leases we signed during the quarter was very strong, and the associated revenues, which will kick in shortly, should bode well for our future results as they have in the past.  Our customer base continues to be active overall and a bit more evenly spread than the recent quarters with a couple of carriers picking back up with higher volumes of new site deployments and modifications. We expect this trend to continue through Q4 and into 2008 where we predict there to be very robust activity for most of our core customers for both new sites, overlays and modifications. The carriers continue to show strong demand for both new subscribers amidst increased minutes of use from both the voice and data products. The continued adoption of wireless data and the increased number and functionality of the devices and services offered is truly amazing. We strongly believe that higher speed ubiquitous mobile data access is going to continue to drive strong growth for years to come.  At SBA alone, we have deployed over 3900 wireless units for both voice and data service for our employee business use and for almost all of the backhaul needed for monitoring our lit [ph] tower sites. We believe that uses such as machine-to-machine connectivity will continue to grow and penetration rates in the United States will rival the highest in the world over time. We have very high quality towers which continue to be demonstrated on both the revenue and expense side of our leasing business. The operational lease up in Q3 was our highest in over five years in terms of total tenants added and our highest on a revenue added per tower rate in over two years.  In Q3, 84% of our new leasing business signed on our towers was derived from new tenant agreements while 16% came from amendments to existing agreements. This mix continues to show... continued new cell site deployment for capacity, fill-ins and geographic expansion as we have seen in the recent past. 92% of the new revenue signed on our towers came from telephony and other major broadband carriers.  Leasing activity on both our recent acquisitions and our new builds has also been excellent, which give us confidence in our ability to continue to find, build good multi-tenant sites. Rental rates for new tenant leases remain solid as well with average cash basis tenant rents across the entire portfolio at $1783 per month, up from $1767 per month at the end of the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 14,781 signed leases, representing an average of 2.5 tenants per tower.  Our tower expenses continue to run at very low levels of both OpEx and CapEx. Q3 is typically the highest quarter for repairs and maintenance OpEx due to the storm season, but Q3 this year was a banner quarter for us in that regard. We continue to be very active buying the land and extending the leases under our towers as well. That helps with expenses and we now own or control for at least 50 years the land under 23% of our towers. For tower augmentation CapEx expense, for the full quarter, we only $979,000, most of which was reimbursed to us by new tenants leased in the space.  In the services segment of our business, Q3 revenue was at 22.1 million and segment operating profit was 2.9 million or 13%. Q3 revenue was down 7% from the year ago quarter, but operating profit was up 16%. We continue to be happy with the gains we have made in profitability in this segment of our business and happy to see the volumes increasing as well. We continue to have a diverse backlog in this business between many different customers and plan to continue to stay focused on the core services that we have always offered: site acquisition, construction and technical services.  Overall, we feel good about our operations at SBA and we are looking forward to a solid fourth quarter and a good 2008.  At this point, I will turn it over to Jeff. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Thanks Kurt and good morning everyone. We had another very solid quarter at SBA, one that has us very excited about the future. To understand our excitement, I want to spend a few moments on some of the drivers behind our third quarter results so that you can better understand why we are projecting an acceleration in 2008 site leasing revenue, tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA growth compared to our actual third quarter '07 over year earlier growth rates.  Our third quarter growth was solid, but we expect to do better for several reasons. First, the third quarter represented the fourth consecutive but last quarter of higher Cingular specific AT&T merger decommissioning churn. This merger specific churn cost us probably a couple of hundred basis points of organic same tower revenue growth the last couple of quarters. Going forward, we know there will be increasingly less merger-related churn and as a result less of an impact on our organic growth rates. That issue alone will have a positive impact on 2008 growth.  Second, our third quarter financial results fully reflect our operational lease up in the fourth quarter of '06 and the first quarter of '07 and very little, if any, of our second and third quarter 2007 operational lease up due to the traditional lag between signing leases and financial statement revenue recognition. On a gross revenue added per tower basis, the second and third quarters of 2007 combined were 20% higher than the prior two quarters combined, which increase really won't begin to show up in our financial results until the fourth quarter of '07, and then only some, and the first quarter of 2008 when we should begin to fully see the increase.  Third, our services business grew materially in the third quarter, up over 10% from our first half quarterly average with further growth expected in the fourth quarter. This shows us our customers are busy and materially more active than in the first half of '07. Our carrier customers continue to stay active at these heightened levels and we expect that to continue through 2008.  Finally, while we were very busy acquiring towers in the third quarter, most of that activity took place at the end of the quarter and did not materially contribute to third quarter financial results.  So, we come out of the third quarter feeling very good about the future. You can see our optimism in our fourth quarter outlook and particularly on our full year of 2008 outlook.  Two points to keep in mind when considering our 2008 outlook. First, we assume the same gross amount of revenue added per tower in 2008 as we expect for the full year 2007. There could be some upside there since the second half of '07 is running 20% higher than the first half of '07 and we believe the higher rate of lease up will carry into and through 2008. If there are material 4G deployments, it could be even better. Second, we do not include in the outlook any planned acquisitions that we have not signed, even though it is our goal to grow our portfolio another 5 to 10% or more in 2008 through buying and building towers. We believe that there will be again enough opportunities in the market in 2008 that will meet our investment criteria to achieve our portfolio growth goals. We intend to stay active growing our portfolio and we believe we are well positioned and have the resources to do so.  Speaking of resources, we ended the quarter in a strong tax position not too different from where we ended the second quarter notwithstanding a large amount of acquisitions. We accomplished that by maximizing our capital resources through use of a mix of cash and stock for acquisitions and we are very pleased with the results. We maintained a strong cash position. We have stayed flexible for future opportunities. We have been able to time our next access [ph] to the debt markets. We stated our target leverage levels. We invest in capital well ahead of plan. And where we did issue stock, we did so on a very accretive basis to equity free cash flow per share. year-to-date, we are buying good growth towers at a mid 17 times tower cash flow run rate. That's on a current basis at a 15 times or less forward rate. That's very attractive quality growth and we are convinced that using a mix of cash and stock to maximize that growth is the right way to go. We intend to do more of the same in 2008.  There are many other reasons for our optimism, and I will touch on two. First is the positive impact of new spectrum on our customers and their desire for additional infrastructure. We are just now starting to see the development of the AWS spectrum auction last year. We believe it will take years, that's four [ph], to fully develop this spectrum. The excitement and interest around next year's 700 megahertz auction continues to grow. It will take well into 2010 and likely beyond to fully develop the infrastructure to fully service the 700 megahertz spectrum. As a result, we expect years of additional demand for tower space.  Second is the strength of our customers business. AT&T, Verizon, Sprint have all reported their third quarter results. Once again for all companies, wireless was the growth engine. Within wireless, data was the highest growth segment and is now producing a material portion of the revenue per user. I believe these results present conclusive proof of the permanence of data as a wireless offering. It's here to stay. For the tower industry, we believe that will translate into a need for more antenna as wireless data networks require greater numbers of antennas than voice-only networks.  We are excited about the future. Our customers are very busy and expected to stay busy. I think we are executing well on our three part strategy of organic growth, portfolio growth and capital structure management. We are achieving our goal of material growth and equity free cash flow per share. And as you can see from our 2008 outlook, we expect to achieve our goal again next year.  And Brett, at this time, we are ready for questions.  Question And Answer 
Operator:  Indeed. Well, thank you very much Mr. Stoops and our executive team for your time and that third quarter update. We do appreciate that. And ladies and gentlemen, as you just heard at this point, we invite and encourage any questions or comments that you may have. [Operator Instructions]. And first in queue, we go to the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets:  Thank you. Good morning. Your '08 outlook, I am just kind of wondering what sort of seasonality are you expecting in terms of site leasing activity. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  I think it should be pretty stable, Jonathan. I mean as you know, you have been at this a while, you know that really to get a revenue dollar out of a lease, it that has to be signed up one or maybe two quarters before. So we're already have some of our 2008 results signed up. Really, we would have to sign leases up through probably no later than September of next year to have an impact on 2008 financial results. So the main part of what's left to impact '08 is the first half, and we think the first half of '08 will kind of be a continuation of where we are now. So don't really see much seasonality as it impacts the '08 numbers. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets:  And then the AWS U.S. license fees, when are you expecting to see the lion's share of the new market launches and the impacts on your business? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Well, I mean I can't speak to the market launches because that's a pretty well guarded secret by our customers. But I will tell you that we are working on markets today that I don't think have been publicly announced yet because of the time it takes to get a market ready to launch from those AWS auction participants. I will say we are signing up leases today in AWS markets and we expect that to continue to grow as we end this year and move into the next. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets:  And those are not amendments and overlay related, but those are new market launch related? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Those are new market launches. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets:  And then finally, maybe for Kurt, any views on WiMAX in terms of activities that you are seeing in the field? 
Kurt Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer:  They had... it's like the markets moving forward, and we expect those to continue, especially the big two for launch, and we know of several others that are very active and we are working with them on, and we don't really have any other new news on that right now. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets:  Thank you. 
Operator:  And thank you very much sir. And representing the Stanford Group, we go to the line of Clay Moran. Please go ahead. 
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial:  Good morning. You mentioned 12% adjusted leasing revenue growth, is that a same tower number? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  No. 
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial:  What's the same tower revenue growth in the third quarter? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  In the third quarter, it's going to be a little bit below 10%, Clay, because of the churn and the lease... the lower impact of leasing. As we move forward, the '08 guidance assumes a low double-digit number for same tower. 
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial:  Okay. And can you remind us what your target net debt to EBITDA range is? I think you are basically at the top end now. But using your 2008 guidance, you'd be under the midpoint. Are you considering a stock buyback program, if that's the case? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  We will... we are comfortable at our leverage levels and we will be considering additional leverage to either buy back stock or, as is our preference, and I think it will continue to be our preference, to keep growing the portfolio. 
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial:  And that range is 6 to 8 times, right? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes. 
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial:  Okay. Thanks Jeff. 
Operator:  And thank you very much sir. And next in queue, we go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. 
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc:  Good morning guys. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Hey Ric. 
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc:  Hey. Following along on that line, if you look at your '08 to '07 increase in EBITDA and you look at your target range on leverage of 6 to 8 times, there is added debt capacity there with the added EBITDA from the growth of this great business. What do you look at as far as timing entering the market? Looking at securitization style, it takes a little longer; looking at other type of debt, is it kind of once a year bullet or what should we think of as far as when you might reload on that forward-looking EBITDA? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, on a steady state kind of basis where we do a lot of smaller transactions, it's probably a once a year type of thing, although we have never had a history of only doing one a year, so. But that would probably be a reasonable assumption if we look to do something bigger like associated with a larger transaction, you could see more than once a year type of relevering. And we are pretty opportunistic. We look at all markets and we will access the right market at the right time. 
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc:  Okay. And then on your '08 guidance, nice to hear the double-digit same tower revenue growth isn't baked into that or low double-digit same tower revenue growth. You mentioned I think in your comments Jeff that if 4G is material, there could be upside. What have you baked in there kind of for 4G, Clearwire and Sprint into your guidance you gave us? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Well, not much. I mean we don't really do a really granular bottoms-up approach. We take more of a what are we doing now and how do activity levels feel. And really, while we have gotten some from those guys in '07, we haven't gotten a tremendous amount. Clearwire a little bit more earlier in the first half for the year. Sprint's been, I would say, not that active all year long. So to the extent we are carrying that over into next year, we are really not relying on much if anything there. And that's why I say if there are material 4G deployments, it could be better. 
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc:  Right. And then on the AWS stuff, you mentioned that it's starting to see some pick up in activity. Is the equipment available to the operators to actually start strapping on the tower, not so much the handset side, but literally the base station, antennas to work at that frequency? Are the manufacturers starting to produce it so it'll be ready to start strap on and pay you guys rent? 
Kurt Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer:  Yes, Rick, this is Kurt. I haven't heard any issues at all with that. So I know we are moving markets ahead on our services business with them, and that has not come up at all. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, I mean, aren't we doing some installs? 
Kurt Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer:  Yes. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes. We are doing the install work, so it must be there. 
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc:  Okay, good. Some investors have been concerned that the equipment might not be there even though the spectrum gets cleared. So that's good news. And final question, as you look at the land program, what kind of multiples are you paying on the land side? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  We are paying 11 to 12. 
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc:  Great. Well, good luck guys. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Thanks Rick. 
Operator:  And thank you very much Mr. Prentiss. Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley has our next question. Please go ahead. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Okay, thanks a lot. If we look at the adjusted EBITDA margin as reported, there is very strong improvement from last year, but it's actually almost entirely flat the past three quarters, and I think the midpoints for fourth quarter guidance would have the margin actually declining. So how should we reconcile this with the obvious scalability of the tower business model and what are your views on the long-term margin potential at the EBITDA level? Thanks. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes. To the extent EBITDA margin is flat for, as you suggest, Vance, might move backwards in Q4, it would be entirely due to growth in the services business and margin. I mean the true picture of the scalability and growth of the tower business. Look at the tower cash flow margin which constantly grows. The only variation in our EBITDA margin, to the extent it's not going up, is going to be because services actually perhaps outperform and contributed more in that particular quarter. But the tower side leasing business margins go up, up, up and up. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Okay, thanks for that. And then could you also comment on the amount that you are paying for the acquired tower? It seems like average prices have been ranging from 400,000 to 700,000, maybe trending up a bit and your discretionary CapEx just hit a high. Is the average price paid likely to increase over time as it becomes more difficult to find available towers? And given your strict criteria for ensuring a deal is accretive, do you think that the number of towers purchased could slow at some point during '08? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Well the price per tower is really... it's almost directly oppositely correlated to the multiple. I mean we are buying towers of varying maturities. We'll pay a lower multiple for a higher price tower and a lower dollar per tower for a higher multiple tower. So I wouldn't draw any conclusions from the price per tower without really understanding the relationship of price and multiple. I think you should look at the average price we have paid and you should think about that and you should think about the fact that we are paying around 17.5 times today's run rate but with a forward expectation that that's 15 times or below, which we think is really good. And we have greatly exceeded our expectations in the M&A area this year. What it has told us is there are still a lot of towers out there that perhaps we thought we knew about, but as it turned out, we didn't. It really shows that over the last several years, this entrepreneurial business has been grown by a lot of smaller players who are building towers and buying some towers and looking to pull a few together and then sell them to people like us. So I think we have got another shot at doing really well in 2008. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Okay, great. And finally, you mentioned signing up leases today for the auction 66 spectrum. On the 700 megahertz, one of your peers mentioned they are already working with carries on the planning process. Are you seeing the same type of early interest in the 700 megahertz band? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Very little, very little. Some, but very little. I mean it will go the same way it always does in our opinion. The auctions will come and they will come to SBA for their leasing needs. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Yes, I would agree. Okay, thanks. 
Operator:  And Dave Coleman with RBC Capital Markets has our next question. Please go ahead. 
David Coleman - RBC Capital Markets:  Thank you. Just on the site leasing margins, should we think about it on a, I guess, subsequent quarters margins down at the 70% range or will they revert back up to 73%? And then second question, on Sprint's conference call yesterday, they talked about slowing the rollout of Pivot. I am just curious whether there has been increased activity from the cable operators as far as putting the AWS spectrum that they picked up last year at work. Thanks. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, Dave, on your first question, make sure you factor in that one-time charge, which is the reason why margins are where they are. If you take that out, margins haven't gone down at all and they will continue to increase. 
David Coleman - RBC Capital Markets:  [indiscernible] but should we assume that they get back to that 73% for fourth quarter and then in 2008 as well? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, you should assume at least. 
David Coleman - RBC Capital Markets:  Okay. Thanks. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes. On the cable stuff, we don't really have any news there in terms of what those guys are thinking or doing. 
David Coleman - RBC Capital Markets:  Great. Thank you. 
Operator:  And thank you very much Mr. Coleman. We have Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs next in queue. Please go ahead sir. 
Unidentified Analyst:  Hi, good morning. This is Scott Mallet [ph] sitting in for Jason. Just following up on the multiples on towers, it does seem like the prices are moderating after rising for a while. Can you just characterize the competition for sites out there? I know it's always competitive, but does the credit environment help out a bit? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  It does a little bit, but there are still some well funded competitors out there. We are trying to be very disciplined on our returns. We are doing... we are buying more than we thought, but we are losing more than a few too in terms of price. I would say prices have stabilized. I don't think we have been able to push them down like we had hoped. We might be able to with the credit issues that popped up in August and September, and are working their way through, probably put a stop to further price increases. But it really hasn't reserved itself. So we are somewhat at a plateau right now. 
Unidentified Analyst:  Thanks, that's helpful. And then just following up on the land acquisitions, can you just remind us of the amount of land leases that you have coming up for final expiration just over the next several years or even 10 years? And then and recently when renewing the leases, what has the direction been? Is it getting more pricey? Can you provide any more parameters around renewal of leases? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Well that's a great question for us because we are unbelievably well positioned on that front. I literally think the number of leases that come due in the next five years that we can't renew you can count on one hand, maybe less. Our number of leases that are due in 10 years that we can't renew is 1%. So we have an unbelievably secure position in the industry when it comes to that issue and we are continuing to work really hard on that front. Prices have come up from where they were a year ago. I mentioned we are now paying 11to 12 times. That's been kind of that way for six months. And some of the economic issues that are affecting the country more broadly we think have actually helped free up some opportunities for us here within these price ranges. So we think we'll do a good amount again next year at similar prices. 
Unidentified Analyst:  Thank you very much. 
Operator:  And thank you, Mr. Armstrong. We have David Janazzo with Merrill Lynch next in queue. Please go ahead sir. 
David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch:  Good morning. Jeff, another one on the M&A. So you mentioned in your release well positioned to grow the portfolio by 5%, 10%, or more. What would the factors be that would drive it towards the 5% or possibly the 10% or even more? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Well, it's going to purely be seller timing. There is enough towers out there for us to buy. It's all a question of are the decisions being made for the sellers to sell at that time. I believe given our cost of capital that we will always be able to be successful within our return requirements. I guess that's another risk if prices go too high and we don't hit our returns we won't be buying. But I am not sure why other peoples returns should be that low that they will get funding to do all that. And that really hasn't happened over history. Certainly, we do lose some deals based on price, but in general we manage to see our way clear to get our fair share of prices and towers that we like. So it's really... I mean the absolute number of towers out there is way more than enough to satisfy the high end of our range. It's really just... it's it' kind of... you can lead a horse to water metaphor, but can't make him drink. Is the seller ready to go or not? That's really kind of what drives the opportunity base in this business. So that's going to dictate, probably... that would answer both ends of your question. What will cause it to be at 5 or what could cause it to be at more than 10? 
David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch:  Okay. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  I think we have plenty of capital and access to capital. That's not going to be an issue. The cost of capital today would absolutely support continuation of our M&A strategy at the prices we are paying. So I don't see that as an issue. It's really all seller willingness. 
David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch:  Got it. Thanks. 
Operator:  And thank you very much sir. Representing Lehman Brothers, a question from Brett Feldman. Please go ahead. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers:  Yes, thanks for taking the question. I was hoping I could get two questions. One on the cost side and then one on the strategic side. So on the cost side, if we think about the next couple of quarters, you have been buying a lot of land. How is that going to be reflected in your tower operating cost, your cash tower operating cost? If I were to look at a per tower level say on a per month basis, are we getting to the point where you purchase enough land that you may actually see that number decline or is it just going to enough to offset the natural sort of inflation-related costs you would see in that side of the business? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Well I think certainly the latter and hopefully we can do enough to get to the former. But right now the safer bet would be it would offset some of the other inflationary elements, which are great. I mean the other costs besides ground rents are site maintenance, and we are doing really well there. We actually came in under budget pretty much all this year on that front, and property taxes, which are growing but kind of at an inflationary rate. So we are hopping to offset those, Brett, through the ground lease purchase program. And if we can do really well, we can actually take the absolute cost per tower down. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers:  But for a tower where you are currently leasing the land, what percentage of your costs at that site are associated with that lease? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  70% of the cost base. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers:  Okay. And then just on the G&A side, is there any reason why your recurring quarterly G&A level would begin to change from where it is right now, particularly into '08? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Not other than an inflationary type change absent some AAT type deal. But beyond that, no. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers:  That's a perfect segue into my next question, which is that you have obviously been able to do a lot of one-off transactions with your existing capital structure and liquidity. What's your appetite right now for doing another sort of transformational deal, something that would add potentially thousands of towers to your portfolio? And then assuming your interest in it, does that mean you believe you could finance it both through equity and in the debt markets particularly the asset-backed market? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Well we would not do anything to be transformational. We would do something just like we did AAT because we thought it made great financial sense for our shareholders. So if something fits that bill, we are interested. The subset of that, though, was can it be financed in a way that still makes it a financially great deal for our shareholders. So you have to kind of work all those elements together, Brett, to come up with a decision to move forward on something or not. And if it kind of hits our accretion to equity free cash flow per share goals, including the post-transaction cost, the financing, we are interested. If not, we pass and keep doing what we are doing. But we are not... we don't have to be bigger just to get bigger. We would be looking to get bigger because, if by doing so, we are going to be pretty sure it's going to be accretive to equity free cash flow per share. And there is financing available, markets are open. They are a little more discombobulated than they were a year ago, but they are still there. Towers continue to be extremely well perceived in the capital markets. So it's not so much an access issue as it is a cost issue which will get factored into the decision as to whether something is accretive or not. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers:  Do you think it's necessary that there be an accommodating sort of securitization market behind the deal or do you think you could tap into other types of debt markets to finance transactions as well? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, I think you could go to the bank market for what you might otherwise have previously done in the CMBS market, and then you just have to look at the cost and see if it makes sense. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers:  Okay. Well, great. Thank you for taking the question. 
Operator:  And thank you very much. Two participants left in queue. Next we will go to the line of Gray Powell with Wachovia. Please go ahead. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities:  Thanks a lot guys. Just had a few quick questions. If I do some simple math on your site rental revenue guidance, it looks like that your 2008 guidance implies an incremental 44 million in leasing revenue versus 41 million in 2007. So given that the full 5 to 10% growth in your tower portfolio is not completely factored into revenue guidance, I would think that you guys would assume leasing demand to be higher in 2008 than it is in 2007. Is the difference there mainly just the lack of Cingular decommissionings in 2008? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, that's a big component of it, Gray. I mean they... I think that the whole decommissioning thing probably, at least in the third and the second quarter, cost us close to a couple of hundred basis points of net growth, and that will be gone as we move forward. So that is a driver. And the rest of it must be... that really has to be it because we are not modeling any more revenue added per tower than we are expecting this year. And then the only other factor would be the timing of acquisition closings. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities:  Okay. And then typically as we move from Q4 in to Q1 of a new year, we generally see a seasonal slowdown in demand for the carriers, but it seems like things will be different this time around. And with the additional activity from AT&T and T-Mobile and the other AWS winners, do you thing that's going to be the same case next year? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, it should because the AWS winners are on market launches and they can't stop on January 1 for like a rebudget, a recheck. I mean they've got to... they are in the middle of a project. When you are in the middle of a project, it crosses calendar years without missing a beat. And I would feel the same way about the T-Mobile 3G overlay. I mean they are ramping that up and they know they need to get it done and they are not going to stop on January 1 to see where they are. It's a project. But then the rest of the carriers I think will do what they typically do. And we feel pretty good that we'll move into the first quarter of next year at a fairly steady state. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities:  Okay. And then just last question, more of a housekeeping item. Is it safe to assume that the acquisition revenue contribution for Q3 is that same 2 to $3 million range that's been the last couple of quarters? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  In Q3? 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities:  Yes, Q3 of this year. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  I don't think it's that high. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities:  Oh, it's less than 2 million? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, I think most of what we did was pretty well at the end of the quarter. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities:  Right. I was talking about like all the acquisitions from the last 12 months in terms of breaking out like the internal revenue growth rates. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  How about you call us back on that? We'll try and do a little work on that. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities:  Okay, thanks. 
Operator:  And thank you Mr. Powell. We have William Pitkin with GE Asset Management. Please go ahead. 
William Pitkin - GE Asset Management:  Yes, hi Jeff. I just had a question about you mentioned a number of the carriers that there was no reference to Leap or Metro. And I was wondering about if you could comment on any activity you have seen with them. I mean they are obviously looking to roll out a number of markets in the first half of next year, and given that you've typically had that kind of visibility 90 to 120 days out, if you could just comment on some of that activity? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, Bill, without naming them, when we were talking about the letters of the AWS spectrum, that's kind of who we were talking about. So we are staying activity, it's good and we expect it to continue. 
William Pitkin - GE Asset Management:  Okay great. That's perfect. Thanks. 
Operator:  And thank you very much. Well with that, Mr. Stoops, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to you for any closing remarks. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Great. Well I appreciate everyone joining us today and we look forward to sharing our progress with you next time. Thank you.

Later, there will be an opportunity for your question; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Capital Markets, Pam Kline. Please go ahead. 
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President - Capital Markets: Thank you for joining us this morning for SBA's second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kurt Bagwell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Macaione, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, I need to get the standard SEC disclosure out. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2007 and beyond. These forward-looking statements maybe affected by the risks and uncertainties in our business. Everything we say here today is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factors set forth in last night's press release and our SEC filings, particularly those set forth in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31st 2006 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which documents are publicly available.  These factors and others have affected historical results, may affect future results and may cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement we may make. Our statements are as of today, August 3rd and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make.  Our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the other information required by Regulation G is included in our earnings press release which has been posted on our website, www.sbasite.com.  Tony, would you comment on the second quarter results? 
Anthony J. Macaione - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Pam and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results were very solid and in that we exceeded the high end of our guidance on leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and equity free cash flow. We had a very straight forward quarter with no material unusual or one-time items.  Total revenues were $100.3 million, up 14.8% over the year earlier period. Site leasing revenue for the second quarter was $79.6 million, up 27.7% over the second quarter 2006, driven by strong organic growth and acquisitions. Site leasing segment operating profit was $58.4 million, up 29.2% over the year early period. Site leasing contributed 95.6% of our total segment operating profit in the second quarter.  Tower cash flow for the second quarter of 2007 was $58 million, a 26.6% increase over a year earlier period. Tower cash flow margin was 75%, approximately same as the year earlier period.  Our Services revenue was 20.7 million compared to 25.1 million in the year earlier period, reflecting the impact of slower activity from AT&T in the second quarter compared to the year earlier period, when AT&T was a much more active customer for us. Profitability in the segment improved materially as Services segment operating profit was $2.7 million compared $2.1 million in the year earlier period. Our Services segment operating profit margins were 13% in second quarter, a strong improvement compared to the 8.2% in the year earlier period.  SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $11.6 million and $9.5 million on a cash basis when you exclude non-cash compensation charge of $2.1 million. This compares SG&A expenses of $11.5 million in the year earlier period or $8.7 million on a cash basis excluding non-cash compensation charges of $1.5 million and one-time AT&T integration cost of $1.3 million. We expect quarterly SG&A expenses to stay at these levels for the remainder of 2007.  Our net loss is $15.1 million compared to a loss of $75.6 million in the year earlier period. Net loss per share for the quarter was $0.15. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 103.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain items such as non-cash leasing revenues and ground lease expense and non-cash compensation, was $51.5 million in the second quarter, which was up 30.5% over the year earlier period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 52.5%, up from 45.8% margin in the year earlier period.  Once again, equity free cash flow increased materially in the quarter, reflecting strong EBITDA growth, low weighted average cost of debt and stable non-discretionary capital expenditures. Equity free cash flow for the current period was $29 million, an increase of 76.7% over the year earlier period. Equity free cash flow per share increased 64.7% to $0.28 per share in the coming period, up from $0.17 per share in the year earlier period.  During the quarter we acquired 68 towers, built 15 callers and ended the quarter with 5783 towers owned and the right to manage over 5600 additional all substantial communication sites.  Cash capital expenditures in the second quarter was $51.4 million. About which we spent $1.6 million on maintenance tower CapEx, $1 million on augmentations and rebuilds and $200,000 on general quarter CapEx. We also spent $43.9 million of cash and acquisitions, ground lease purchases and earn outs and $4.7 million on new tower builds and new build work-in-process.  With respect to the land underneath our towers, we spent in total 11.7 million in cash to buy land and lease and to extent certain ground lease terms. Our ground lease purchase program is going extremely well, and we are significantly ahead of plan. And at this point, I want to turn things over to Pam to provide an update on our capital structure. 
Pamela J. Kline - Vice President - Capital Markets: Thanks Tony. The second quarter was quite a one first us in the capital markets. SBA ended the second quarter with $1.555 billion in the commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates outstanding, 315 million of the 0.375% convertible senior notes, $228.6 million of cash, restricted cash and short-term investments and net debt of $1.676 billion. We expected our cash balances combined with our growing cash flows from operations will be more than sufficient to meet our capital expenditure needs through the end of the year, even with our strong acquisition backlog.  We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the second quarter. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.1 times at June 30th 2007. All of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average cash coupon of 4.9%.  Our cash interest coverage ratio from adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest was very strong, 2.6 times compared to 2.0 times in the year earlier period. Now, Kurt would you please provide an update on operations. 
Kurt Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks Pam and good morning. As you can see by our numbers, we're very pleased with Q2 results and our performance. Revenues and margins were strong. Costs were in line or better than expectations. We continue to steadily grow our asset base and we finished the quarter with strong backlog.  Our customer base overall remains active. History continues to repeat itself and at each quarter some carriers were slowing down a program and planning for the next, some are picking up activity and some just steadily deploy. Overall, the organic leasing activity in Q2 was very high, as we had our best growth lease up quarter per tower in a year and signed more new co-location tenants than at any time in the last 5 years.  Our customers continue to add to and refine our networks to produce high quality service for voice, data and video. Continued heavy subscriber increases and subscriber minutes of use increases are also driving the action. There is intense competition between the carriers to improve their networks in an effort to attract more users and reduce their churn.  In the second quarter, we saw good activity from Verizon, MetroPCS, T-Mobile, Cricket and Clearwire. It's expected that Sprint Nextel, AT&T and T-Mobile will pick up in the second half, we are just starting to see signs of that activity for both new leases and amendments to existing leases.  In Q2, 83% of the new leasing business signed on our tower was derived from new tenant agreement, while 17% came from amendments to existing agreement. This is a higher mix of new tenant agreement than we obtained in the recent past, reflecting more geographic expansion, new carriers entering markets for the first time and slightly left overlay work. We expect the overlay amendment activity to be higher in the second half of 2007 in terms of total dollars signed.  93% of the new revenue signed on our towers in the quarter came from telephony and other major broadband carriers.  Rental rate for new tenant leases remain solid. An average tenant rents across our entire portfolio increased yet again to $1757 per month, up from $1753 at the end of the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 14,212 time leases, representing an average of 2.5 tenants per tower. We expect this pattern of increasing average monthly rent to continue each quarter.  Same tower year-over-year revenue growth on the towers we owned for more than a full year at June 30 was 10.5% net of churn and 12.2% excluding Cingular AT&T churn, which we view is one-time in nature and different from ordinary churns. Same tower cash flow growth was 13.5% net of churn for the same period and 15.2% excluding Cingular AT&T churn.  Based on the second quarter results of our peers, our organic growth rate once again led our industry and reflect the high quality and desirability of our towers. We are doing a great job on minimizing the cost associated with our tower portfolio, resulting from both the hard work of our employees and the high quality of our assets. We are the industry leader in low risk maintenance and augmentation costs per tower, which is a direct result of the fact that we have compared to our peers the highest percentage of towers on our portfolio built specifically for the independent tower ownership business.  On the asset growth front, we purchased 68 towers and build 15 more in Q2, bringing our total own tower base to 5783. We've purchased an even greater numbers of towers already this quarter; we have a strong acquisition backlog. We expect the new build activity to continue to grow each quarter through out the rest of the year. On both class of new assets, the subsequent leasing activities has been very strong, we plan to continue to push hard with our plan of growing our asset base in a steady high quality manner.  In the Services segment of our business, Q2 revenue was at $20.7 million and segment operating profit was $2.7 million or 13%. Q2 revenue was down 17% from the year ago quarter, the segment operating profit was up 31%. We are very pleased with our gains and profitability in the segment as we focus on profits over volumes. Forward services revenue was due primarily to reduced bookings from AT&T which historically has been one of our top 2 services customers. It would be a mistake for people to misconstrue our services revenue as a good indicator for our leasing business, as our services business is always much more relied on one or 2 customers in any given quarter.  Other carriers that we don't perform as much, services business were extremely busy as evidenced by our leasing results and increased leasing guidance. AT&T was not as busy in the second quarter, but we are starting to see AT&T become more active. We continue to anticipate this year will be a more traditional year for services, with each classic second quarter growing versus the previous one.  Overall, our operations at SBA continue to be strong and we believe 2007 will be a solid year for the industry and especially for our company, as our clients continue to expand their networks.  At this point, I'll turn it over to Jeff. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Kurt and good morning everyone. We had another very strong quarter at SBA, meeting or exceeding the high end of our guidance and exceeding consensus estimates for leasing revenue, adjusted EBITDA and equity free cash flow. I'm going to keep my comments brief because our strong results speak for themselves particularly, our organic growth rate of substantial growth in equity free cash flow per share.  All in all, we had a very good first half of the year. We believe that the second half will be even better. We continue to operate in a very favorable customer demand environment. As we have discussed, we expected AT&T and T-Mobile will be more active in the second half leasing power space than they were in the first half and that all the other carriers will remain at least as active as they were in the first half of the year. Our leasing and services backlog support our expectation and we're starting to see increased activity in the field.  The operating results of our wireless carrier customers were once again good and all major wireless providers have publicly confirmed plan to invest material sums in their wireless networks. Last couple of months have been very active in the wireless business, including the announcement of a number of acquisitions and partnerships involving our customers. We view the acquisitions of the Royal carriers as good news for our industry as we expect AT&T and Verizon to roll out their full suite of wireless service and products to these markets overtime.  Or perhaps the most important to us is the announcement from Sprint and Clearwire of their partnership to share one nationwide WiMAX network. We view this announcement as increasing the likelihood of development of a nationwide WiMAX network, while it doesn't mean that Sprint and Clearwire will probably not both build out the same 4G market at least at the same time or initially, we always view that prospect is some what speculative and certainly not something we have accounted on our platform. We continue to be very active with both Sprint and Clearwire on developing 4G networks and expect to stay active.  The upcoming 700 MHz Auction is also capturing a great deal of attention. While we can't predict the winners, the amount of attention the auction is getting and the number of parties interested indicates to us that the auction will be successful and the spectrum developed. We expect our industry will materially benefit from the 700 MHz Auction particularly from the accelerated build out requirements. When you put all these factors together, you have an environment that we expect will continue to produce very strong organic growth for the foreseeable future. Our organic growth rate have been very strong and we expect to continue to produce strong double-digit organic revenue growth going forward.  With our strong organic growth and our expectation that it will stay strong for the foreseeable future, we have a continued interest in growing our tower portfolio with high quality assets. We are having very good success in that regard. We have a significant number of towers under contract to acquire and are actively pursuing additional opportunities. We are also continuing to build towers and buy the land under our towers. We continue to focus on acquiring towers that on average has fewer tenants per tower than our current portfolio and adds good or better growth prospects at acquisition prices that we believe will in the long term produce returns materially above our cost of capital.  We are staying disciplined and have chosen not to pursue a number of opportunities where we did not think we could produce our desired returns. Having said that however, we are well ahead of where I thought we would be year-to-date on the number of quality towers we have acquired or have under contract to acquire. I'm very confident that we will meet the high end of our goal of expanding our tower portfolio by 5 to 10% this year of quality assets.  We have funded these acquisitions primarily with cash, but we've also used some stock because it was either required by the seller or we chose to conserve cash for other acquisition opportunities that we know or expect will require cash. In every case where we issued stock, the transaction was immediately accretive to equity free cash flow per share. We do not repurchase any shares of our stock in the second quarter, as we continue to review a number of additional acquisition opportunities out there that we believe would be better investments for our shareholders.  If those acquisition opportunities do not work out for us, we continue to have Board authorization in place to repurchase an additional 2.8 million shares from time-to-time through December 31, 2007. We feel great about the rest of the year. We've increased the midpoint of our full year guidance for a number of metrics reflecting our strong first half of the year results and our expectations for an even stronger second half. We are particularly excited about our expectations for continued material growth in equity free cash flow per share.  SBA is currently in a sweet spot for equity free cash flow per share growth as evidence by our 65% year-over-year growth and 22% sequential quarterly growth. We expect strong growth in equity free cash flow per share to continue. I believe 2007 is shaping up to be another very good year for SBA and we look forward to reporting future results. And Dale, at this time, we are ready for questions.  Question And Answer 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, good morning. Couple of questions; one, I noticed your build guidance was lowered by 20 towers for the year and was that driven by more M&A than you thought or just zoning issues, what's kind of driving that? And then in terms of the M&A activity, the 68 towers in 2Q in the 99, so far in 3Q. What's the typical, any multiple transaction side, in terms of number of towers, capacity of the assets reach into the country. Can you give us a kind of a profile of the towers that have been acquiring recently? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, on the fist question Jonathan, it's not really... because the new build number is not caused by M&A as we have plenty of capital to do both. It continues to be driven by difficult operating environment where zoning and having the right first tenant on the tower upfront before we build it continues to be the gaining issues in our ability to produce more volume. So, it's all about operational issues and having the things in place that we require to have in place before we build the tower. But we're working hard at it and as Kurt said, expect to continue to wrap that up as we move from quarter-to-quarter. What we're buying actually varies quite a bit from a single-tower transaction to the largest we have on the contract is probably 60 towers and it varies on the multiple depending on the maturity of the tower. We're paying anywhere from 13 times tower cash flow for more mature assets to 20 times tower cash flow for assets that are essentially new builds. I would say the average is probably around 17 times type tower cash flow multiple run rate on day one, and I would guess 1.5 tenants per cover on average which is not only accretive to our existing valuation, but it also we think offers a better growth profile... I mean our existing growth profile is great but at 2.52 tenants buying towers that are below that which we believe obviously be as good as our portfolio growth profile and probably will accelerate given the difference in starting tenants. So we are extremely pleased with what we are being able to accumulate out there in the acquisition market and it's really a testament to our hard work and the fact that we've been in this business for ten years and we do have a great network out there and we are prepared to buy good towers one at a time, if it makes sense to do so. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks. And then in terms of services margins, what's been kind of driving some of the increase there? 
Anthony J. Macaione - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Just at a price point, Jonathan in general on some of the work we've been pretty selective with that and part of the revenue shift, we were doing very well our site development services which is a higher margin business than our construction services, it's a lot of volume business but a higher margin and it's more on the front end of the carrier deployment, so that's up quite a bit year-over-year. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: And then finally, I think you've been in the market for a fairly senior operations person can you fill us in on any management changes? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: We just hired a new Vice President to head up our new build efforts so, Gary Lervine [ph]. And we have that person started Monday and to head a well known option we are expecting some good things. 
Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. 
Operator: We got to Clay Moran with Stanford Group. Please go ahead. 
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial: Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the factors that has enabled the surge in tower buys, seems clearly could be an acceleration in the rate there and is this pace sustainable or is to how long is this pace sustainable and then just do you foresee a time when the opportunity to acquire towers in the U.S. close down such that you would start to look overseas? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: What's sustaining... what's creating the dynamic environment today Clay is the many respect the same factors that have made it competitive on the new build side. There are lot of very entrepreneurial people who've been around this industry for years, who were out there developing towers on their own, new builds 1, 2, 5, 10 at a time. And their goal in life is to get them developed, get a tenant or two on them and then sell them to folks like us. They don't have the long term capital structure in place that allows them to hold those assets. They can build them at what is a good price for them, sell them at what they think is a good price and we can buy them at what we think is the great price for us going forward, so that's the dynamic there. There is couple of different private equity folks back folks out there who have made the decision to sell for reasons that were unique to their own private equity funds, whether its timing or raising a new fund, so there exists a lot of different factors out there that are pretty unique to each individual seller, but when you added all up, its allowed us to have a great pool of opportunities. I think a lot of the reasons that I've just described will continue to play themselves out for the foreseeable future. A number of towers have been built over the last couple of years by people other than the big three tower companies. Those will be people who would be looking to monetize those overtime, so we feel pretty good about it. I don't know if we'll get 10% every year. We're pretty confident we're going to get it this year and our goal for next year would be a similar 5-10% portfolio growth, feel pretty good about that. But after that the crystal ball gets a little more cloudy.  At some point I would think there maybe a reduction in the opportunities. We're going to test that little bit but we really think that our best value creation continues to occur here in the United States. But before we would ever reach the point where we would just come to you and say, look we can't run the company anymore. We would certainly look internationally. I do fully expect in the future to do that, but its not something that we need to do today to deploy the capital that we wanted to deploy and we got plenty of opportunities right here in the U.S. 
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial: Okay. Is there any change competitively in the U.S. M&A market? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's a little bit more competitive. I mean based on the answer I gave to Jonathan, probably last year, a year ago the answer would have been, our average whose maybe 15 times to 16 times and now it is 17 times, although we view the lease up environment today is better than it would have been a year ago, so we are extremely happy to be getting the quality assets that we're getting ahead of what we continue to believe would be a lot of lease up activity over the next couple of years. So in that respect maybe it's a little bit more competitive, but the number of players out there who are competing with us and who they are and what their financial resources are, that really hasn't changed that much. 
Clayton Moran - Stanford Financial: Okay thank you. 
Operator: And we'll go Gray Powell with Wachovia. Please go ahead. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had two quick ones. In terms of new entrance such as Leap Wireless, MetroPCS and Clearwire, just generally speaking how far advanced a market launch you typically see them putting equipment on towers. And then looking forward, what do you expect to be the bigger components of incremental demand; traditional spinning from the big 4 or the impact of emerging carriers? 
Kurt Bagwell - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Greg, this is Kurt. I'll take the first one. Yes, typically I would say 6 to 9 months they are putting equipment on some of the first tower that they've leased. They will put equipment on some of the last towers that are included in the launch right up until a couple of weeks before their launch. But they've got to get started on the market launch 6 to 9 months in advance for deploying some of that equipment. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: And on the second, Gray, a year ago it was more heavily tilted towards the traditional big 4 and we continued to think that they will still be the predominant source. I mean T-Mobile has a lot of work to do and others will continue to invest in their network but this year the contribution from the emerging carriers and I assume in that category you'd define Leap and Metro and Clearwire, those guys have contributed a higher proportion of our incremental revenue growth than they historically have and we would expect that to continue, but if we had to obviously weigh one category as where the biggest number will come from, it's... we think its till going to be the traditional big four. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then just as on a different subject. As you look at your growth in free cash flow compared to the opportunities to reinvest in your business, do you think that you're going to continue to focus cash entirely on growing the portfolio or is there a chance sometime maybe 12 or 18 months for more meaningful share repurchase program? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: We always have the opportunity to be a share repurchaser and we will be a share repurchaser at the point in time that I think that's a better use of our capital than continuing to add high growth assets. So, I mean, that's the heart of our strategy right now. We always have share repurchases ahead of us, but we are out building our portfolio today with quality assets ahead of what we think will be a very high growth period. 
Gray Powell - Wachovia Securities: Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: And we'll go to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. 
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Thanks. Good morning guys. Couple of questions for you; first, Jeff, you said one of the exciting parts of your story which is the growth in the portfolio of 5 to 10% a year. What are your thoughts about going elephant hunting? I mean, there is T-Mobile folk out there that has I guess about 5600 towers. What are your thoughts about the big tower portfolios? And then another question, Sprint and Clearwire were talking about obviously exciting to getting those networks build. But also the possibility of some infrastructure sharing within markets, Clearwire maybe collocating its front side. What's your view on that please? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well in the first topic, I mean we would approach any opportunity Ric kind of revised wide open; we did a big deal last year which worked out very well for us. We don't view any deal as a must-have because of any strategic reason, I mean we're fine besides we are, but it's all about growth that accelerates growth and equity free cash flow per share and if we can do it be over does that we're interested. If the deal can't be done on terms that would do that, then we're not. AIC is a great example of the deal that really worked well for us in growth and equity free cash flow per share. Yes, we would be happy to look at a bigger deal on the right financial terms. We look at them one at a time or there on us. In terms of Clearwire and Sprint, I mean, from a... I think the heart of your question is thus can Clearwire come in and somehow take advantage of existing Sprint contractual rights and equipment and lease it SBA hardly since they are very specific and none of our customers have the right to commend and just add equipment. So we don't see any particular worries there about any type of ability of Clearwire and use existing Sprint locations and somehow not capture what we would otherwise get from a new tenant on that perspective. 
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Okay and then with the 700 Mhz auction coming up you have mentioned as briefly. Will your services business get any benefit if people kind of look through the process or really after people win, the spectrum of your services business might get a piece of that business? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Historically it's after. I mean, if you look at last year's AWS auction, other than a few calls about what kind of resources do you have, the real action doesn't start till people win. 
Ric Prentiss - Raymond James: Great. Good luck guys. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Ric. 
Operator: We'll go to Brett Feldman with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Pam mentioned earlier that you were not very active in the capital markets in the second quarter. I thought maybe you could just review what your plans are going forward with regards to incremental financing especially when you think about some of the volatility we've seen in the mortgage markets. Do you still think that market is going to be open to you going forward? Or do you think you are going to have to start looking at other forms of debt financing as you add leverage? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: We think that market... the CMBS market for tower spread will continue to be open. We're tracking things pretty carefully there and the market is there. I mean the rates may move up and down a little bit, but as people continue to work through and look at the various asset classes and they look at the results that are being produced by the tower industry. They will quickly conclude that what we have is very different from sub-prime mortgages, so we do see that market continuing for us.  We have a... we're very pleased with our capital structure and flexibility today. We have a lot of cash that we have sitting on the balance sheet ready to utilize and we also are building a large pool of unencumbered towers that we can use for other financing if we so choose. By the time we close the towers that we have under contract we'll have over a thousand towers outside our existing securitization unencumbered... I don't know Tony, what $15 million, $20 million plus of tower cash flow that is totally free for us to use for additional financing if we so chose, so we feel pretty darn good about our ability to continue to access financing to stay in our target range of 6 to 8 times and continue to execute our plans. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: So based on the current plan and that growth in the cash flow it's outside of securitization, when would you normally expect to go back to the market? Is there something that you think you are going to do a couple times of the year or is it annual event or is it a hard to pin down right now? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's kind of hard to pin down and it really would vary based on the acquisition opportunities that we see but kind of it in a regular $100 million to $200 million per year of new investments, you could probably safely assume that we would go back to the markets once a year or so to kind of re-top up the gas tank to 8 times leverage and then delever, invest and then that process would repeat itself kind of once a year. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: Okay and then there is one more question on different topic. You alluded to a lot of the network initiatives out there that should keep leasing levels pretty healthy for some time. I know you are not ready to give away guidance or anything like that, but if you could just may be qualitatively talk about the backlog of business you have right now and may be how that has compared to similar points in time at previous year. In other words, do you feel your visibility, it's incrementally higher now than it's previously been or is it about the same? 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: The length of the visibility based on application is about the same because carriers, they kind of work 3 to 6 months ahead and that's it. The magnitude of our backlog though is great particularly compared to where we been in the last couple of years and we're coming off what I think is the best July we've had in 5 or 6, 7 years in terms new leases signed up. So we see... I mean, all that stuff is real and its hard evidence of the very vibrant leasing background. But then the more qualitative aspects are just the ongoing dialogue that we're having with every carrier about what their plans are longer term and it adds up to just a lot of work between now and the end of 2009. 
Brett Feldman - Lehman Brothers: That's great. Thanks. I appreciate it. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we do have a question from Amar Ahmed [ph] from Owl Creek [ph]. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, I just wondered if you could expand on why is shares you have purchased towers versus up your cash? 
Anthony J. Macaione - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Because we see other opportunities out there that will require cash without any... it's basically a maximization of our capital resources. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. But I guess, I'm just confused because it seems as if you have I guess, maybe it was like 16 million shares used fro CapEx and you're still planning on spending about $66 million in cash, so I guess, are you finding yourself unable to make cash repurchases?. 
Jeffrey A. Stoops - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, what you don't know is what we're looking at is not under purchase and sales. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. 
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. Please continue.
