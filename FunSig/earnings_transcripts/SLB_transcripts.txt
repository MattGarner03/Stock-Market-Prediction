===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-25 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Megan, and I'll be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter SLB earnings call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to James R. MacDonald, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs. Please go ahead.
James McDonald: Thank you Megan. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following our Board meeting in the Middle East last week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward looking. Uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected. For more information, please refer to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings which can be found on our website. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter earnings press release, which is on our website. Finally, in conjunction with our proposed acquisition, Schlumberger Limited and ChampionX have filed materials with the SEC, including a registration statement for the proxy statement and prospectuses. These materials can be found on the SEC's website or from the party's websites. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier. Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
Olivier Le Peuch: On the call this morning. I'll begin by discussing our first quarter performance. I will provide updates on the evolving macro and how we manage our business in this uncertain environment. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial performance, and I will open the line for questions. Let's begin. As you have seen in our earnings press release this morning, it has been a soft start to the year. In addition to the typical seasonal activity decline in the Northern Hemisphere, and the absence of year-end product and software sales, upstream investments have remained constrained by the oversupplied oil markets. This has been amplified over the past few weeks with additional economic uncertainty stemming from the acceleration of supply raises by OPEC plus and recent tariff announcements. Again, it is more challenging, but I was proud to see our teams continue to deliver for our customers. We finished the quarter by achieving further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion year on year. Overall, across the business, first quarter revenue decreased by 3% year on year, as our strong results in North America were more than offset by lower revenue in the international market. Attributed to a combination of lower learning activity in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and a steep decline in Russia. Excluding declines in these three countries, international revenue was steady year on year. We achieved double-digit growth in a number of markets including The United Arab Emirates, North Africa, Kuwait, Argentina, and China, as well as a solid performance in Europe and Scandinavia. Altogether, this resulted in international recount outperformance. Turning to North America, we delivered positive results driven by the offshore market, with higher sales of both digital and subsea production systems. We also saw continued growth momentum in our data center infrastructure solution business industries. However, this growth was partially offset by lower drilling revenue in US land due to weak efficiency gains. Next, let me discuss the performance of our divisions. In the core, Production System continued to lead the way, with steady revenue growth and further margin expansion. Customers continue to demonstrate strong demand for surface production systems, completions, and artificial lift. This late-cycle business is becoming more profitable, with margins increasing by 197 basis points year on year, supported by favorable activity mix execution efficiency, and conversion of improved price backlog. Specific to subsea, we remain constructive on the market outlook with a significant pipeline of projects planned over the next couple of years. I was pleased to see margins in this area expand materially compared to the same period last year as a result of strong execution and the realization of cost synergies within our subsea OneSubsea joint venture. In terms of our performance, revenue was slightly down year on year, and margins were significantly impacted by challenges on several new projects that resulted in start-up and a portion of cost overruns. We continue to see strong demand for unconventional stimulation in international markets, including The United Arab Emirates and Argentina. However, this was fully offset by lower evaluation and exploration activity as a result of lingering white space in deepwater. New well construction declined year on year due to lower drilling activity across both North America and international markets. Despite this decline, I was pleased to see that one-third of our international units actually grew year on year in the first quarter. With digital integration, growth was entirely driven by digital, where revenue grew 17% year on year as customers continue to embrace digital technologies and solutions. Customers are accelerating the adoption of digital and AI solutions to extract further efficiency and performance across the upstream lifecycle, both in planning and in operations across development and production. In our earnings press release, you can see several examples of customers adopting our digital solutions. Finally, as an update on our progress beyond oil and gas, we continue to experience positive momentum in the low carbon markets, driven by capture acquisition, as well as in our data center infrastructure solution business. Combined, revenue from CCS, geothermal, critical minerals, and data center solutions is on pace to visibly exceed $1 billion in 2025. Overall, I'm proud of the performance our team delivered this quarter, and I want to thank the entire Schlumberger Limited team for their hard work and commitment to customer success. Next, let me discuss the macro environment and how Schlumberger Limited is adapting accordingly. The industry is navigating global economic uncertainty stemming from the supply-demand imbalance and recent price announcements. In this environment, commodity prices are challenged, and until they stabilize, customers are likely to take a more cautious approach to near-term activity and discretionary spending. Beginning with the supply-demand balance, we expect to see new supply enter the market as OPEC plus has announced plans to increase their production beginning in May. This comes at a time when the macroeconomic picture remains uncertain due to global trade concerns, which have the potential to result in lower demand than originally expected for the year. Taken together, these factors are resulting in uncertain market backlog. At this point, we expect global upstream investment to decline compared to 2024, with customer spending in The Middle East and Asia being more resilient than other regions across the rest of the world. Against this uncertain backdrop, we remain focused on what we can control. We will continue to execute our strategy, deliver differentiated performance for our customers, carefully manage costs, and remain committed to returns to shareholders. In the core, we remain positive on the long-term fundamentals for oil and gas, and we will continue to deepen our partnership with our customers throughout the last second of the assets. This includes an increase in phases on the production recovery market, and we expect to unlock new growth potential and long-term resilience through opportunities for technology deployment. In digital, customers are investing in solutions to reduce cycle time, improve performance, and drive efficiency. We continue to pursue opportunities in AI, cloud computing, and digital operations. Today, we are seeing the decoupling of digital investment from upstream spending, and this will increasingly represent a unique and exciting opportunity for our business. In our business beyond oil and gas, we continue to capitalize on low carbon markets with our new energy offering, particularly in carbon capture and geothermal, while harnessing adjacencies as we have demonstrated with our rapidly growing data center infrastructure solution business. Let me quickly highlight our data center business. Over the past two years, we have engaged our hyperscalers, whom we partner with in digital, to unlock new opportunities for our business through the development of data centers. This has led to significant contract awards for the provision of manufacturing services and modular cooling units, which we are currently fulfilling. Based on our performance and unique capabilities, we are also gaining access to new opportunity pipelines, and we are expanding our technology offering with low carbon solutions to serve new potential customers. Overall, this is a very exciting and fast-growing market, driven by AI demand and expected to contribute to our diversified exposure beyond oil and gas in the coming years. Beyond our operational performance, we also have been on a journey of cost optimization and process enhancement. Moving forward, this will support our mission to protect margins despite softer customer spending. What matters in this environment is our ability to continue to generate strong margins and cash flows, deliver resilient returns to shareholders, and come out stronger. Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to do this, and I believe that the combination of our strategy and cost actions will help to protect our business moving forward. As a result, we remain committed to returning at least $4 billion in returns to shareholders in 2025. Now before I hand over to Stephane, let me quickly share our guidance for the second quarter and the rest of the year. Specific to the second quarter, assuming there is no further escalation of tariffs, and that oil prices remain approximately at current levels, we expect revenue to be flat sequentially, excluding ChampionX, with an adjusted EBITDA margin expansion between 50 to 100 basis points. Looking at the full year, while a number of different scenarios could materialize, including tariffs and OPEC plus actions, assuming oil prices remain similar to current levels, we expect flat to mid-single-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year compared with the first half, excluding ChampionX. This will be supported by a combination of the seasonal activity uptick, new start-ups in the border, and further growth in our digital and data center business. Under these conditions, we also expect further margin expansion. Look, I know there is a lot of uncertainty in this market, but we have been here before. We are operating from a strong position and have a clear priority of preserving margins while generating robust cash flows. Our broad exposure is providing resilience against uncertainty and short-cycle weakness, as you have seen in our results today. I am confident that our people, our technology leadership, and our financial strength will clearly position us for long-term success. I'll now turn the call over to Stephane to discuss our financial results in more detail.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.72. This represents a decrease of $0.03 when compared to the first quarter of last year. We recorded $0.14 of charges during the quarter. This included $0.11 of charges in connection with our cost-out program that we initiated last year, and $0.03 of merger and integration charges related to the ChampionX and Aker subsea transactions. Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $8.5 billion decreased 3% year on year. International revenue decreased 5% year on year, largely driven by reduced activity in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, offshore Africa, and Russia. North America revenue increased 8% year on year, due to higher digital and subsea production system sales as well as strong growth in our data center infrastructure solutions business. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins for the first quarter were 23.8%, up 18 basis points year on year. Pretax segment operating margin was 18.3%, representing a 60 basis point decline year on year as two of our four divisions experienced lower margins partially mitigated by the effects of our cost-out program. As we navigate the current market dynamics, we will continue to exercise cost discipline and we will align our resources with activity levels in the coming quarters as necessary to protect our margins and cash flows. As it relates to tariffs, the evolving landscape clearly introduces uncertainty, which makes it challenging to fully assess their impact at this time. Broadly speaking, we are partially protected by our activity mix, with approximately 80% of our revenue derived from international markets, as well as by our diversified supply chain network that includes in-country manufacturing and local sourcing. However, parts of our operations are still potentially exposed to increasing tariffs, primarily from imports of raw material into The US in our Production Systems division, as well as exports from The US subject to retaliatory tariffs. Under the current tariff framework, the majority of the impact is on import and export flows between The US and China. So any resolution or conversely escalation between those two countries significantly impacts the tariffs we may be subject to. While those discussions are taking place, we are taking proactive steps to mitigate the potential impacts. This includes reviewing how to further optimize our supply chain and manufacturing network, as well as diligently pursuing all applicable exemptions and drawbacks. We are also actively engaging with customers to recover our tariffs-induced cost increases through contractual adjustments. We have made progress on all these fronts in the last two weeks, and we are stepping up those actions across the organization as we speak. As the second quarter progresses, and ongoing trade negotiations continue, we will hopefully gain better visibility of where tariffs may settle and the extent to which we will be able to mitigate their effects on our business. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each division. First quarter digital and integration revenue of $1 billion increased 6% year on year driven by 17% growth in digital revenue. This growth was partially offset by lower APS revenue, due to a temporary pipeline disruption that impacted production in our projects in Ecuador. While this issue has been resolved, it did cost us $0.01 of earnings in the quarter. Digital and integration margin of 30.4% expanded 380 basis points year on year entirely due to improved profitability in digital. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 1% year on year. As strong unconventional stimulation and intervention activity was offset by lower evaluation and exploration activity. Margins of 16.6% declined 311 basis points as compared to the first quarter of last year due to the less favorable activity mix as well as project start-up costs. Well Construction revenue of $3 billion declined 12%, and margins declined 71 basis points year on year on significantly lower drilling activity. Mexico and Saudi Arabia alone represented approximately two-thirds of the revenue decrease. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.9 billion increased 4% while margins of 16.2% grew 197 basis points year on year. These results were driven by the resilience of our portfolio in product and recovery activities, and were augmented by significant revenue growth in our data center infrastructure solutions business. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $600 million of cash flow from operations, a significant increase compared to the first quarter of last year. We generated positive free cash flow of $103 million despite the payment of annual employee incentives and the seasonal increase in receivables due to continued capital discipline working capital management. Despite the uncertain economic environment, we expect our cash flow generation to remain strong and to grow throughout the year consistent with our historical trends. Capital investments inclusive of CapEx and investments in ATS projects and exploration data were $557 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.3 billion, excluding any impact from the anticipated closure of the ChampionX. Our net debt increased $2.7 billion sequentially to $10.1 billion. This increase largely reflects the $2.3 billion we spent on our accelerated share repurchase transaction during the quarter. This ASR transaction was completed in a pre and resulted in us reducing ultimately our shares outstanding by a total of 56.8 million shares. 47.6 million of these shares were received in the first quarter, while the remaining 9.2 million shares were received in April. The ASR transaction, together with the dividend increase announced last quarter, will allow us to meet our commitment to return a minimum of $4 billion to shareholders in 2025. Let me conclude with an update on our pending M&A transactions. While these transactions are obviously taking more time to complete than initially anticipated, we are pleased with the progress made during the quarter and continue to work towards successful closure. As it relates to ChampionX, as we announced a couple of weeks ago, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority has agreed to consider our proposed actions to address their concerns as part of their Phase one review. We will continue our collaboration with The UK and other regulators towards an anticipated closing in the second quarter or early third quarter of 2025. With respect to our overspending transaction, we now expect the divestiture of our interest in the Palis APS project in Canada to close in the second quarter. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. 
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. I think, Megan, we are ready for taking the questions from the floor. Thank you.
Operator: We will now begin the Q&A session. If you would like to ask a question, please press. Your first question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, Olivier. How are you?
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Dave. Very well.
David Anderson: So we've heard from a number of other service companies this week on the outlook. Some of them more sobering than others. But I think we're starting to frame sort of some of the potential outcomes for international North America. The rest of the year. You said upstream spending, you're expecting to decline this year.
Olivier Le Peuch: But I was hoping you could maybe clarify a little bit how you see North America from here at these oil prices. And how does this factor into your guide to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year, in which you have a very different mix than your peers?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, absolutely. No, thank you. Thank you, Dave, for the question. Indeed, I would like to clarify. So as you know and as we have highlighted in the prepared remarks, global upstream spend will be down year on year, with a higher decline than originally anticipated. There is no argument against that, nor against the current public data independently of the type. It's in fact itself. It's already showing down. What is important is how Schlumberger Limited is positioned against this backdrop. And now we see more downside exposure in North America than in the international market. In this negative revision. But first, if we look at our position there, we are not tied to the regional frac fleets. And, actually, are long in offshore, in digital, and in production in this market. Furthermore, we have data center solutions there. So I think if you look at it, our exposure here has been key factors leading to a strategy we initiated about five years ago. We are now reaping the benefits of having better resilience against the short-cycle exposure we have as part of North America, because of our offshore pollution market exposure, digital, and now in new business. Excluding the data center infrastructure solution, our year-on-year would have been growing. Year on year, proving that resilience is in place for now. Now flipping to international, we see less exposure or less decline proportionally directionally than in North America. As the resilience, as I said, of the Middle East and Asia, including offshore, including unconventional, including gas, will continue to play a role in holding better this market. So we have the right exposure offshore. We have the right exposure in gas internationally, partly unconventional. We are growing, as you have seen, our digital. And push and recovery remain a lot the nice exposure we have across the group. Speaking of which, I believe that the upcoming acquisition integration of ChampionX would not only enhance our resilience but improve mix in North America. And give us a further digital and further offer exposure across the world as well. So I feel good about where we are in the cycle, and I think, just wanted to reconcile a bit why we have maybe having decent performance going forward, we expect.
David Anderson: Great. Thank you. Very much appreciate on the different mix here. I wanted to focus on one of your core countries, Saudi Arabia. You mentioned it got off to a bit of a slow start this year. We recently heard another rig company just talked about another rig being dropped. Can you talk about how you see Saudi playing out kind of from here for the rest of the year? On the one hand, do you think conventional oil activity maybe picks up later this year with these OPEC barrels coming back in the market? And then you have the unconventional natural gas activity ramping up. So I guess I'm wondering overall, should we start to see sort of more sustained growth from Saudi starting later this year and into 2026? A lot of moving parts here if you could help us. Understand those. Thank you. 
Olivier Le Peuch: A lot of moving parts indeed. And I think, again, you have to set the clock back to what happened last year. I think an adjustment of the ambition from 13% to 12 MSC that has led to a steep decline of activity that is translating to what we are seeing today year on year on our recreated activity. Now when it comes to this year and next, I think indeed, the priority of the kingdom is clearly to stabilize the pollution and to be able to respond to this OPEC plus pool. As they materialize, in the short term at least. And to continue to execute that gas ambition to go 40% that gas. And beyond by 2030, And as such, the gas land and unconventional gas will remain a priority that we see and receive further activity increase. Now is there pending further reduction to adjust to the level of activity, adjust the commodity price like other accounts we will do. Possibly. But I think directionally, the commitment to long-term gas, the commitment to maintain and the activity that relates to maintaining these 12 million barrels MSC, will indeed represent likely an uptick as we go into 2026 for Saudi. So that's what we expect. So, yes, a lot of moving parts, but our exposure there is a we love our position in Saudi. I was just recently here, with a few more members visiting the kingdom, and I think I have the opportunity to measure firsthand the engagement, the proximity we have and the feedback on our performance that is stellar. I think we'd like to keep it that way and thank the team for what they are delivering on. On a difficult market condition. But, yes, I think, I believe that the worst is behind us from decline, and if there is some adjustment this year, I believe that the gas-led growth will help us rebound going forward.
David Anderson: Right. Thank you very much, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Scott Gruber: Morning, sir. So I wanted to add
Olivier Le Peuch: Morning. I wanna ask about what
Scott Gruber: EBITDA margin level you think you could defend in a modestly weaker market year on year? Previously, with the cost restructuring, it felt like you were targeting to defend 25%. It looks like, you know, take a margin slightly north of 25% in the second half to get there this year. But do you think you can get the EBITDA margin back to the 25% level in the second half? You know, excluding the impact of ChampionX? 
Olivier Le Peuch: I think excluding the ChampionX, and excluding escalation of tariffs. I think I believe that if we assume that the scenario commission we have put out but oil price remaining in check with current opportunity current level, And the guidance we gave on the growth in the second and leverage we'll have and the realizations of our cost-out program, the digital effect, and the rest. We have the ambition to grow our margin in the 25% for the full year. That's something that will ambition, but the tariff is a big question mark. And I think, if the tariff we have to stay or escalate from where they are, obviously, the impact you would have as Stephane described, I think we'll have a represent a headwind to this margin expansion in the second half.
Scott Gruber: I appreciate the color. And then turning to digital, how do you think about the cadence of digital growth in this environment? You know, on the one hand, digital is obviously an efficiency enabler. I think, you know, in that vein, it could accelerate. But on the other hand, there is some, you know, exploration spend, some discretionary spend, you know, within the digital mix. How do you think about the resilience of digital growth in this environment? We continue to think about that
Olivier Le Peuch: At high teens growth rate for the year? I think this remains our ambition. We believe that I think this secular trend of digital adoption in the industry is actually accelerating. Now there will be some discretionary decision. There will be some pressure in there. There will be some projects that will be reconsidered. But overall, I think, we believe that the efficiency gain, both, productivity for the and effectiveness for the planning show sounds workflows. And the direct impact on the performance of the cost of ownership. Or operational workflows. I think it's still playing out and resonating very well for customers at the time they want to expect efficiency. So against the global upstream CapEx I think as we come up with the in your previous question, that we decline year on year, we are still seeing mid to high teens clearly, growth into our digital business. Driven by this secular trend that we are fully capturing. Our technology strategy and our platform strategy is clearly playing out. And you have seen the diversity of the award that we get different customers, different region, geosounds operation, progress we are making with many customers across the world. Great. I appreciate the color, Olivier. Thank you. Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Arun Jayaram: Yes, good morning. Olivier, I was wondering if you could elaborate on Schlumberger Limited's strategy kind of to diversify the portfolio beyond oil and gas? I think you mentioned you're on pace to exceed maybe $1 billion of revenue. This year versus, I think, $850 million last year, but maybe talk about some of the steps you're taking there. Some of the longer-term growth potential.
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Thank you, Arun. I think, yes, I think we have initiated about three to four years ago a strategy with new energy. I think the major aspect of that that will continue to impact us in the short term are three ways. First, CCS, where we took a position to acquire capturing. And I think we have a Schlumberger Limited capturing I think is the capture technology that I think we have four active products and many products in the feed. That will continue to materialize and create a growth at them going forward. So this combined with our sequestration adjacent to the core capability in exploration and characterization of this reservoir sequestration capability, I think it's leading to visible growth on our CCS all in success, and this will continue. So we don't see the pattern slowing down. We see this as a long-term market position. We want to continue to own and grow. Geothermal, starting from commercial geothermal has been something that has been getting more focused and more adoption for customers. And now there is a lot of pilots on the new generation, on next-generation, Azure thermal that is being highly supported by the administration partly in The US. I believe this is also something that we continue to grow. And finally, I will mention the lithium direct lithium extraction. We are seeing the pilots we have successfully completed last year. The first pilot at scale in The US, I think, is again resonating very well with the critical minerals priority of the current administration. And we see this in South America. We see this in Saudi where we're actually participating in a pilot as well. So this is successful. And separately, you have seen that the data center is something that we have used I think the relationship, the engagement we had to position ourselves as a provider of manufacturing capability, manufacturing services, as well as modular cooling solutions for the data center and the success is great. And I think I'm very pleased with the price of the team. Have a plant in Louisiana that is serving this business. We have large contracts that we are fulfilling. And that has been now our growth in North America, and we expect it to continue going forward this year and next clearly. So, yes, the ambition is to go from the $850 million plus to visibly more than $1 billion when we put all of this together. I will not expect it to slow in '26, but to continue to accelerate.
Arun Jayaram: Great. That's helpful. Maybe my follow-up is for Stephane and maybe just to maybe clarify some of the Outlook comments. My team tried to estimate what your outlook comments would translate into 2025 EBITDA.
Operator: Our
Arun Jayaram: We're getting to somewhere between $8.4 to $8.5 billion. I don't know, Stephane, if you could maybe give us some color if that makes sense. And maybe the clarification is how are you treating Palliser and some of the tariff-related impacts in terms of the full-year outlook?
Stephane Biguet: So, Arun, we will stick with revenue-only guidance for the rest of the year. As Olivier mentioned, the growth assuming current oil price more or less stays at the current level. So we stick with revenue. We think it's premature to give you an EBITDA for the second half and hence for the full year. And some of the reason is indeed the tariff the application of tariffs with we think giving you a number on tariff at this stage is would not be useful for financial modeling. Unfortunately, we'd love to, but it's quite difficult. But as I said, we are partially shielded by domestic manufacturing and sourcing, but it is clear if it stays that way, we will have an impact. We will try to mitigate it, and we are already doing that for optimization of supply chain and through ultimately trying to pass the impact to customers, but what matters at the end is that we are still seeing margin expansion in the second quarter. Despite tariffs being effective now. And this is to let you know 50 to 100 basis points as we mentioned for Q2 sequentially. And for the second half of the year, margin expansion, assuming again that our oil price stays more or less at this level, we will have growth in H2. And this will come with margin expansion. But quantifying that margin expansion, H1 to H2, it will not be the right thing for us to do today.
Arun Jayaram: Totally understand. Thanks a lot, Stephane.
Scott Gruber: Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Yes. Thanks, team, for all this color. So, as you think about ChampionX, recognize there's some limitations about what you can say around this, but you know, where are we in terms of the gating items at this point? It does feel like we're in the end zone here, but curious here you're the red zone, but curious what your perspective is on what remains outstanding and confidence around closing.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think as Stephane did comment on his prepared remarks, I think we are very pleased with the progress we made very recently, particularly the UK CMA authorities and obtained that they have accepted that we go into remedies extension of phase one through remedies as it has been commented, they have accepted the remedy. So now to walk through these remedies and internal them as soon as effectively we can. And that's the reason why we have increased our confidence to conclude the end of the quarter or early next quarter. Now the other outstanding, I think Norway is known to be a and I think we have been engaged very effectively the last few days and few weeks with the Norwegian authority. And I believe as well that I think we are as we commented. Going to hopefully a resolution there. So that's the reason why we maintain our confidence into the end of this quarter or early next quarter.
Neil Mehta: Yeah. Thanks. And, Olivier, we'd love you to share your thoughts on the macro, particularly from the supply side. You spent a lot of time just all around the world. Where do you expect activity if we're in a lower commodity price environment to be dialed back? What do you think is relatively price inelastic? Is there a price level at which point you see activity particularly cut back? Just your perspective on the near-term macro and then also your perspective on the long-term macro because, you know, you've had an underinvestment view that ultimately long-term, that's gonna catch up here. Does this just reinforce that?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think starting with the long term, maybe it's easier. I believe that the position of oil and gas to feed the energy mix of the world and progress and driven by different demands with the global South, with the AI, with the electrification, I think we'll continue to pull for the long term and this combined with the natural decline that is pressing on many basins as you've seen, We'll continue to call for replenishment and maintaining, if not increasing the first investment that we see today. So long term, the view is intact, and I think the role of the role of our store to address this the role of the commitment of execution to capacity expansion in the Middle East, the role of gas, partly to security of gas supply in Asia. And the development of unconventional international to address this I think we continue to be the area of growth that we foresee long term. To remain. I'm not talking about digital here. Now in the short term, I think it's very difficult to gauge, but I think generally speaking, the short cycle activity would be the first exposed and Americas quite a few hour of short cycle starting with the US land. I think this would be the first that certainly will have the most impact. Internationally, I think the resilience as we mentioned of the Middle East many countries are committed here. Relatively independently of oil price for their capacity expansion. And BTOE, BTOE, BTOE, and activity in some other parts of the country around the Middle East, continue to stay and or if not accelerate. Asia driven by energy security, We'll also have resilience and driven by deepwater. Activity there offshore. Deepwater activity there that is strong and not talking about China. That is holding the activity because they're based on a five-year plan, not on a necessarily on oil price of today. So you combine all this, you still have quite a few exciting pockets of growth. Geography. And you have some secular trend digital. You have increased production recovery and you have an income showing internationally that will continue to be a lot of growth. So yes, there are opportunities to capture. And there are ways to offset the decline of the short-term decline expected into the total CapEx spend. Yep.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Yes, thank you and good morning. Good morning. If we could, Olivier, just you were mentioning Deepwater there. We certainly well, it didn't sound like exploration was an uplift for you in Q1. We've certainly seen the industry start to lean into exploration a little more. And I was just wondering if you could kind of take us around the world a bit on where we are seeing things pick up. I mean, West Africa's looked good. Certainly, Latin America ex Mexico has continued to look pretty good. South America And then I was just curious anything else on that front.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think the reserve replacement ratio is still what drives the IOCs and many large independents and some critical NOCs to your coach to explore. And we have seen a rebound in commitment to exploration the last eighteen months. That I don't see a changing directionally. Although, there will be some discussion taken by some customers, and we have to go one customer at a time to review this. But directionally, I think, the need for replacing reserve for mild majors and the need for developing long-term oil or long-term gas play in Asia or in The offshore basis. At large, I think, remains intact. And I think you are seeing the it it was saying to FID, that we expect to be, binding up in 2627, that will impact the subsea. Business going forward. But, yes, exploration is not over. And exploration takes to form. Exploration, I think, three forms, I would say. One is the near-field exploration. In Metro Basin, Gulf Of Mexico or even Brazil or the North Sea, including Norwegian sector. And then you have the Frontier Basin, big Namibia, big Suriname, big part of Asia. Indonesia, particularly, that are seeing new fresh exploration investment. And finally, you have the other way to explore, which is digital exploration. I think this is what we are benefiting from as well. A lot of reprocessing, a lot of activity for beta processing. And hence, we are exposed to those. So, yes, I think that the exploration will remain healthy. But this year, I may suffer from discretionary decision. And from some lingering white space as we call it in deepwater.
Roger Read: Appreciate that.
Neil Mehta: The other question I had just because it was called out as part of this
Roger Read: Order, Things softer in Russia Ironically, there was an article in the press today implying that Russia activity was at a multiyear high in the first quarter. So a bit of a juxtaposition there. It's just if you could give us any more insights on what you're seeing there.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think I will restrict my the command I'm on to from Russia, because you have taken disposition to implement sanction and critical control of activity there. And this is what has led to a deep decline in Russia, and we expect this to continue as we continue to restrain and take every measure to sanction technology access. And technical support to our team.
Roger Read: Appreciate that. Thank you.
Neil Mehta: Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stephen Gengaro: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
Olivier Le Peuch: Morning. I was I was wondering
Stephen Gengaro: As you talked about the Outlook, and I was sort of focused on the production segment here. Can you talk a little bit about your views on the resiliency of that business versus other parts of the company? And maybe maybe even the margin stability or contribution to margin expansion you see coming from that segment as we go through the year?
Olivier Le Peuch: I mean, I will not comment directionally on the margin. I think we don't we don't provide guidance on margins on our divisions. However, I think the strengths of the production system division, I think, stems from the adoption of this technology the success we have in market position across the globe, both internationally in North America. There's been a growing market in North America, US land particularly lately. I think we have the market share market gain, market position due to technology. We have fit technology. We have a unique electrical completion technology. We are unlocking some efficiency and performance on our lift. And we have some success in subsea parking processing that is in combination giving us this distraction into this, into this market. So that's the first. The secondly, I think, Deep, As You Said, We Expect That, The Long Cycle Side Of This Of This Patient System Will Be More Resilient Against This Market Uncertainty As We See. Some Of The Short Cycle, It's All About Performance. If We Maintain A Performance As We Have In The In The US land market, think we'll maintain our market position although against the tide and be able to grow in those markets. So I feel confident about the ability of the pollution system to go into the role this year. And to gain market position or to leverage the long cycle exposure possibly for success. So I feel confident, but I will not comment on a margin. We are confident that the team is executing very well. Hence, as the we contribute to protecting our margin and contribute to margin expansion going forward.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. Thank you. And then the second question I have was around your confidence in free cash generation for the year. I mean, you're obviously committed to returning a significant amount of cash. How do we think about you sort of stress testing that against the uncertain macro and sort of preservation of cash and balance sheet versus returning capital. Is there a stage at which you slow that down or your confidence is pretty high?
Olivier Le Peuch: So first, thanks for the question, Steven. So we did start the year on cash flow we expected even a bit better, as I mentioned. And we are still quite confident that it will follow the pattern we usually see every year and it will increase significantly in the following quarters. And the second half is really when we make the majority of the free cash flow from here. So yes, you're absolutely right. We do stress testing H2 is uncertain as we said in the lower activity scenario, which is not the best case today. But in case commodity pricing drop further, we would actually expect headwinds on earnings to be partially offset by lower working cap requirements that would provide quite a buffer. So in many cases, we believe actually free cash flow for the year will continue clearly to support our commitment of minimum EUR 4 billion returns to shareholders. So we are confident on our cash flow, and we are confident that clearly, this commitment is not going to change.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Mackey with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Keith Mackey: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to start out maybe on the margins now. Olivier, without commenting on segment margins specifically, certainly, we did see production Systems and Digital up nicely year over year, which seem to support the business very well. Can you just comment on the strategy from here relative to what you're seeing in the cycle? In terms of, you know, where ultimately the business goes relative to what we're seeing as the cycle being a later cycle in the general oil and gas market. And just how you think that all plays out with the different segments and being a more cross cross cross e and p life cycle business.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I believe the strategy we have first and foremost, to continue to I think, leverage the market position we have. They are just a strategy we had in the NAM, as I mentioned. I think it's fit for this market condition going forward. We believe that our exposure internationally, very diverse, broad exposure both onshore onshore, offshore and gas exposure on including unconventional. Digital, and pollution, as you mentioned, I think we'll continue to support and pollution is I will call it pollution recovery, and I think that includes element of our reservoir performance division. As well as our collision system division. I think it's it will have resilience going forward. The training as you have seen, I think, as is more directly linked to the rig activity that I think in this uncertain environment has and will continue to be getting downward pressure. But I think from, as you commented earlier from the from the margin, we will continue to, anticipate like, cost action and, and go to extract efficiency from our organization to the to partially offset this and continue to focus on maintaining our margins. So we believe that as we said, mission remain intact to to protect our margins with all the commentary and and provision of of of oil price and and price. I think ambition remains intact. That in this mix, we believe that digital growth and the growing success we have in production system and the containing the margin pressure on the the result performance and what construction will result into into maintaining and protecting a large enough as much as we can. Excluding dive. As we did as we come up with.
Keith Mackey: Yeah. Appreciate the appreciate the comments there. Maybe just one more on tariffs. I know the situation is certainly incredibly fluid. But does the guidance that you've provided imply continuation of existing tariffs that are on? Or can you help us think about those pieces a little bit more?
Olivier Le Peuch: Well, the second quarter, absolutely, yes. It's assuming current tariff unchanged. That 50 to 100 basis point margin expansion sequentially includes the current tariff framework. And again, for the second half, it will depend on the final tariff framework, which we all know will change in one way or another. So it will the margin expansion will fluctuate based on that.
Keith Mackey: Okay. Thanks very much.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Dan Cutts with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Dan Cutts: Hey. Thanks a lot. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Don. So
Dan Cutts: Morning. So I was maybe hoping we could dig in a little bit deeper on, new energy across your kind of five pillars and, I guess, the, I don't know if you wanna call it the six pillar with the, data center infrastructure. But I think I think you guys have done a great job of quantifying the opportunities around data center infrastructure, and kinda get the sense that among the five other pillars CCUS is maybe the largest. But as you think about your $3 billion 2030 new energy revenue, target how do you think about the contributions across those five pillars? Where do you see kinda the more or less growth potential, more or less contribution? Any color you can share there would be great. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I'm well not ready to, well not here to, to comment, let's say, as an update on our $2 billion ambition for new energy. But indeed, I think CCS, all in, I call it, okay, both the sequestration and all the services, including digital, that we have there will be a large component of that. Okay? Clearly. Jotamol has pretty good momentum, and I think it's too soon to say whether the unconventional or next-generation geothermal is being pursued both in Europe and in The US. With the support of the authority everywhere. I think we'll, like, we'll unlock and give us the second leg of growth. Clearly, too early to say. The lithium, as I commented, I think is a smaller opportunity, but I think it's quite exciting, and we are getting a lot of inbound requests to use the pilot and to test against the critical minimal ambition that, many of our many of our prospect customers have. Be it the mining company or be it a few companies that former MBRs that are stepping into that business. Evogene is more, next decade ambition that we have and same store for energy storage, I would say. And that the center, I think the ambition we have is continue to consolidate and leverage the success we have with this, engagement we have developed and success growth that we have developed. And expand towards low carbon solution that are the a lead for, decarbonizing the power source of, of this data center as well as providing effective cooling and support some manufacturing capacity deploy and deliver these data centers. We would have, at the end of this year, the supported more than 15, data center solution across The US. So that's quite something we have.
Dan Cutts: So, again Great. You can see all of these as a
Olivier Le Peuch: As a sum of business that it would grow at a higher rate than the oil and gas sector for the years to come. Hence, it is again adding to the resilience and to the ability we have to navigate difficult times as we have today. And keep extracting goals or resilience across the the the
Dan Cutts: Awesome. That's all really helpful. And then maybe a quick one just on the APS, on asset performance solutions business. You know, I'm sure the highest priority is kind of getting the Palisir deal across the finish line. But how do you think about the remainder of that portfolio? My understanding is that the Ecuador asset, which is kind of fairly oil levered is the biggest remaining or perhaps only remaining component. Is that something that you guys could potentially be divesting at some point in the future, or is that an asset that you're planning on keeping? Just wondering how you think about the APS portfolio moving forward following the Palisar transaction. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. So indeed, following Palisar, we'll only be left with Ecuador, and it will remain that way. And in Ecuador, we have three projects. And as we explained in the past, these projects are quite different from equity positions such as we have in Canada. They are more like service contracts with the local NOC, with the operator. So you are actually closer to our core business here. The only difference, if I may say, is that we are paid in production equivalent through a barrel instead of an invoice for services. So at this stage, it's quite economic. These projects are providing a lot of cash flow for the company. They are providing good profitability. So considering the nature of the project, they are likely to stay at least for the have a finite contractual term, actually, which we can negotiate and extend with our customer. But at this moment, for the next few years, you have to assume they will stay within our portfolio.
Dan Cutts: Understood. Thank you both very much. I'll turn it back.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Dan Cutts: Thank you, Dan. Thank you. So
Olivier Le Peuch: Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, while the market outlook remains uncertain, Schlumberger Limited is positioned to demonstrate resilience through our strategy. Leveraging our global reach, innovation capabilities, differentiated digital offering, diversification beyond coal and gas, and disciplined cost management. Second, confident in our ability to continue generating strong cash flows, despite the evolving market dynamics. And we remain focused on protecting margins, and committed to increasing return to shareholders in 2025. And finally, we look forward to creating value for our customers, partners, and shareholders in the coming quarters. With this, I will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-17 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Kate, and I will be your conference operator today, and would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter SLB Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to James R. McDonald, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs. Please go ahead.
James McDonald: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. For more information, please refer to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter and full year earnings press release, which is on our website. Finally, in conjunction with our proposed acquisition, SLB and ChampionX have filed materials with the SEC, including a registration statement with a proxy statement and prospectuses. These materials can be found on the SEC's website or from the parties' websites. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call. This morning, I will begin by discussing our fourth quarter and full year results. Then, I will provide an update on the evolving macro environment and our early activity outlook for the first quarter and the full year. And finally, I will describe how SLB's diverse portfolio is uniquely positioned to continue delivering strong financial results in 2025 and beyond. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial performance, and we will open the line for questions. Let's begin. We concluded the year with solid earnings and free cash flow, growing revenue both sequentially and year-on-year, and maintaining our cycle-high margins. Although the rate of upstream investment growth continued to moderate during the quarter, SLB benefited from a broad exposure to global markets, the diversity of our portfolio across the upstream oil and gas lifecycle, and from our differentiated digital offerings. Notably, we saw strong growth in the Middle East, where once again, we achieved a new quarterly revenue high, with contribution from the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, and Qatar. And we also performed very well in North America, where we benefited from higher activity in U.S. land, along with higher digital sales in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Despite the well-known declines in Saudi Arabia and in Mexico, our fourth quarter financial performance remained consistent and resilient. This demonstrates the strength of SLB’s diversified portfolio. Overall, we closed the year with fourth quarter international revenue reaching a new cycle-high, and we generated strong free cash flow of $1.63 billion for the quarter. Turning now to the full year. We achieved our full year adjusted EBITDA margin target of 25%, generated robust free cash flow of $4 billion, and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders. Across the Core divisions, we grew by 9% compared to the previous year. Production Systems led the way, growing by 24% and expanding margin by almost 300 bps for the full year. This performance was supported by double-digit revenue increases in surface systems, completions, and artificial lift, leading to 9% organic growth for the division that was complemented by the Aker subsea acquisition. Reservoir Performance also continued its momentum, growing by 9% year-on-year and expanding margin by approximately 100 bps with strong stimulation and intervention activity. And in Well Construction, although, revenue was flat year-on-year, it continues to lead margins in the Core. Overall, across our Core divisions, our technology leadership, domain expertise, and scale are enabling us to continue innovating tailored solutions for our customers in every region, and I'm proud to share that our fit-for-basin revenue crossed $1 billion for the first time in 2024. This was also a very exciting year for Digital, as demand for our products and services continue to accelerate and we formed strategic partnerships with industry leaders including NVIDIA, Amazon Web Services, and Palo Alto Networks. Our customers continue to embrace the power of cloud computing, AI, and digital operations, to shorten cycle times and improve operating efficiencies, and this led to Digital revenue growing 20% for the full year, exceeding our targets of high-teens growth. Finally, we continue to increase our exposure beyond oil and gas. There is a significant growth momentum in the low-carbon markets where we have a strong position through our portfolio of technologies for carbon capture and sequestration, geothermal, and critical minerals. And we are complementing this with a growing exposure to data center infrastructure solutions, by responding to hyperscalers to deliver solutions that meet the demands of a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Combined, revenue from these activities exceeded $850 million in 2024, and we expect this to increase significantly in 2025. As you can see, we are pursuing a wide range of opportunities within and beyond oil and gas, and this is positioning us to benefit from a very diverse mix of new and existing customer spend. I want to thank the SLB team for delivering this progress. We should all be proud. I'm very impressed by our team's innovative spirit, customer centricity, and performance mindset, and I look forward to building on our successes in the year ahead. Next, let me discuss the evolving macro environment. Over the back half of 2024, customers adopted a more cautious approach to near-term activity and discretionary spending, primarily driven by concerns of an oversupplied oil market. Although these concerns persist, we anticipate the oil supply imbalance will gradually abate. Global economic growth and a heightened focus on energy security, coupled with rising energy demand from AI and data centers will support the investment outlook for the oil and gas industry throughout the rest of the decade. Looking at the global oil supply, we expect that OPEC+ will maintain its focus on commodity price stability throughout 2025. And in the U.S., the ongoing focus on capital discipline by operators will limit near-term supply growth in the region. In this environment, the current level of global upstream investment seems to be keeping the market in balance, absent of any further geopolitical disruptions. Overall, we expect global upstream investment to be steady in 2025 compared to 2024, with the deceleration in some resource plays being offset by resilient growth across select countries and customers. Let me now provide a bit more detail on our 2025 activity outlook. In international markets, while certain countries will continue to experience strong growth, this will be balanced by reducing spending in others. For instance, in the Middle East and Asia, increases in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, China, and India will be offset by declines in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Australia. In Latin America, growth in Argentina and Brazil will be tempered by decreased spending in Mexico and Guyana. And in Europe and Africa, growth in North Africa, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan will be more than offset by declines in Scandinavia and West Africa. Turning to North America. Oil and gas activity is expected to decline due to lower publicly announced CapEx in U.S. lands, higher drilling efficiency, and a slow recovery in gas until LNG capacity expansions are resolved. However, our data center infrastructure solutions revenue is growing rapidly in this region, supporting growth outside of our Core business. Specific to the offshore markets, we expect a muted environment in 2025 attributed to white space in deepwater activity, particularly in the North Sea, Australia, and Angola, Central and East Africa. Looking ahead, we anticipate this white space in deepwater to start improving as the year progresses, in preparation for the significant number of FIDs ramping up in 2026 across several deepwater basins. Let me now describe how these activity dynamics will unfold across the divisions. In Digital & Integration, we expect revenue to remain steady year-on-year with growth in Digital being offset by a decline in APS due to the Palliser divestiture. Digital will maintain its very strong growth momentum with full year revenue growth in the high-teens, supported by Digital operations and data and AI solutions. Meanwhile, in the Core, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year with modest growth in Production Systems and Reservoir Performance, offsetting the decline in Well Construction across the regions. In Production Systems, growth will be driven by artificial lift, completions, valves, and midstream production systems, while Reservoir Performance will be supported by intervention and unconventional activity growth in international markets. Overall, when excluding the impact of ChampionX, we expect the mix of geographies and divisions I just described to result in a steady revenue outlook for 2025. This will translate into adjusted EBITDA dollars and margins being at or above 2024 levels. Now turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be at similar levels as last year, in line with our full year guidance. This will be followed by an activity rebound in the second quarter, particularly in international markets. Finally, let me discuss why I believe SLB is the best-positioned company to navigate the evolving market dynamics that I just discussed. Looking at the evolution of the market in 2025 and beyond, SLB’s size, digital leadership, integration capabilities, and performance advantage are differentiators. Our diversified portfolio across global operating areas and business lines, and our combined exposure to short and long-cycle projects bring resilience, enabling us to navigate regional and market fluctuations. For example, our Digital business is growing with accretive margins at an elevated rate as customers embrace the power of data and AI to drive performance and efficiency across their workflows and producing assets. Our integration capabilities are shaping our engagement with customers beyond NOCs, allowing us to add further resiliency and diversity against the industry backdrop. And production and recovery is becoming a larger part of our business as customers work to maximize their producing assets, and this will be further enhanced by the contribution from ChampionX. Furthermore, and as illustrated in our success in 2024 across low-carbon and digital infrastructure, we are developing new growth pathways beyond oil and gas, in fast-growing markets decoupled from the upstream sector. As you can see, we're operating from a very strong position. And as we remain focused on cost optimization and process enhancements, leveraging digital transformation to become a more efficient organization, this will support our margin expansion journey. The combination of strengths I've just described, along with our continued business performance, provide us with confidence in our ability to continue delivering strong cash flows and increased return to shareholders. You have already seen the action we have taken in our earnings release today, as we increased our dividend and accelerated share repurchases to start the year. I will now turn the call over to Stephane to discuss these announcements and our financial results in more detail.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I will start by providing an overview of our full year results before getting into the specifics of our fourth quarter performance. Full year 2024 revenue of $36.3 billion grew 10% year-on-year, with the acquired Aker Subsea business accounting for half of the growth. Organic revenue grew 5%, entirely driven by the international markets. This was led by the Middle East, which grew 19% year-on-year to reach a record high, despite the well-publicized headwinds in the second half of the year. International pretax segment operating margins of 21.4% improved 44 basis points year-on-year, with more than two-thirds of our international GeoUnits experiencing both top-line growth and margin expansion year-on-year. In North America, full year 2024 revenue declined 1% compared to the previous year. However, pretax segment operating margins of 17% only dropped by 23 basis points, with pricing pressure mostly offset by a favorable technology mix, cost efficiencies, and higher digital revenues. From a division standpoint, organic growth was led by Digital & Integration, which grew 10% year-on-year, entirely driven by our Digital business. On a full year basis, Digital revenue of $2.44 billion grew 20% year-on-year, supported by close to 35% growth from Cloud, AI, and Edge technology. Our Digital business was accretive to both SLB's overall revenue growth and its global margins. Finally, our full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% increased by 52 basis points year-on-year, reaching the highest levels since 2015. Turning to the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter revenue of $9.3 billion increased 1% sequentially, driven by record-high Digital revenue. From a geographical perspective, the Middle East led the way, with 5% sequential revenue growth, driven by the startup of unconventional gas activities in the United Arab Emirates, as well as strong performance in Egypt and Qatar. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter reached a cycle high of 25.7%. This is 33 basis points higher than the same period of last year. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.92. This represents an increase of $0.03 sequentially, and $0.06 when compared to the same period of last year. We recorded $0.15 of net charges during the fourth quarter. This included $0.10 of impairment relating to certain equity investments and fixed assets, $0.04 in connection with our ongoing cost-out program, $0.03 of merger and integration charges relating to the Aker Subsea and ChampionX transactions, and a $0.02 gain on the sale of an equity investment. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1.2 billion increased 6% sequentially, driven by 10% growth in Digital, while APS revenue was essentially flat. Pretax operating margin expanded 274 basis points to 38.3% as a result of higher digital sales and cost efficiencies. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.8 billion declined 1% sequentially on reduced intervention and stimulation activity. Margins increased 35 basis points to 20.5% due to improved profitability in evaluation services. Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion decreased 1% sequentially, and margins contracted 70 basis points, primarily due to lower drilling activity in Mexico and Saudi Arabia. And finally, Production Systems revenue of $3.2 billion increased 3% sequentially on higher international sales of artificial lift, midstream production systems, and completions. Pretax operating margins decreased 93 basis points to 15.8% due to lower profitability in subsea, partially offset by improved profitability in artificial lift and midstream production systems. Now turning to our liquidity. We generated $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.6 billion of free cash flow during the fourth quarter. This strong performance resulted in full year free cash flow of $4 billion. As a result, we reduced our net debt by $1.1 billion during the quarter to $7.4 billion. This represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Capital investments, including CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $759 million in the fourth quarter and $2.6 billion for the full year. Looking ahead, we will continue to be disciplined as it relates to our capital investments. In 2025, we expect to reduce capital investments, excluding the impact of ChampionX, to approximately $2.3 billion, with the CapEx portion at the low end of our previously shared guidance of 5% to 7% of revenue. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 11.8 million shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $501 million. For the full year, we returned a total of $3.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. With continued focus on capital discipline and clear visibility into strong cash flow generation in 2025, we are committed to increasing returns to shareholders once again this year. When combining the increased quarterly dividend that was announced today with increased share repurchases, we are targeting to return a minimum of $4 billion to our shareholders in 2025. Notably, as you saw in our earnings announcement this morning, we entered into accelerated share repurchase transactions to repurchase $2.3 billion of our company's common stock. These transactions not only reflect our confidence in our continued financial performance, but also our belief that our stock is undervalued relative to the strength of our business. Furthermore, this will accelerate the repurchasing of shares that will be issued in connection with the pending ChampionX transaction. As it relates to ChampionX, the transaction received CFIUS clearance in December, and the engagement with other regulatory authorities is progressing well. We continue to work towards closing the transaction before the end of the first quarter. With respect to our other pending transaction, we expect the divestiture of our interest in the Palliser APS project in Canada to close in the next few months. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Kate, I believe we are ready to open the floor to the questions.
Operator: We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Dave.
David Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
David Anderson: So, in your outlook -- good morning. In your outlook, talking about the outlook for international upstream spending, sort of a flat outlook overall, but a lot of puts and takes in there, as you were highlighting. I was wondering if you could sort of simplify a little bit in terms of Schlumberger's exposure, kind of, where are the two or three regions or countries that are kind of have the most upside for you, have the potential to get better, and kind of maybe where are the kind of two or three regions that could potentially get worse? Like, where is the sort of the upside and the downside scenarios in your international outlook?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think I will start with the Middle East at large. The Middle East at large being impacted, as you all know, by the decline of activity, sequential decline of activity in Saudi, it’s still a very bright spot when it comes to multiple countries and multiple customers having their commitments, ongoing commitment to either expand capacity in oil or capacity for the future, such as the UAE, Iraq, and Kuwait. And gas, unconventional gas or conventional gas, across the region is becoming a theme that will result into 40% expansions from 2020 to 2040 of gas production. So, these resilient commitments, these resilient budgets are resulting in growth that is very -- is offsetting the decline we are seeing particularly in Saudi and to a lesser extent in Egypt, and offsetting globally as Middle East as a region with, in my opinion, still a long term resilient, if not long term growth. And I believe that the short cycle activity that was a bit suppressed in the last few months, will come back as a result of the oil oversupply to be abated over time and resulting to this combination of more short cycle and this long cycle project, gas and unconventional and oil capacity, all again, running at all cylinders. So, I believe Middle East for us is certainly a bright spot that will continue to be an advantage basin for us and the international market. Secondly, despite the commentary I put on the deepwater still having quite a lot of white space and resulting into a low activity than could have been anticipated in 2025 in certain basins, certain resource plays. I believe that this is creating the condition for these rigs to be picked up later in the anticipation of the FIDs that are piling up, and that will result in 2026 and '27. Partially, you are fully aware of Suriname, the Namibia, the Indonesia, the Southeast China, and other parts of the globe where exploration has been very active in new basins and will turn in the coming quarters, in the coming months, into appraisal and to FID. So, I'm still optimistic, long-term, and very constructive about the deepwater, despite a gap this year, created by this activity. But yes, this is what I would recommend to look at from international. I would conclude by maybe the gas, international gas market is still due to security in Asia, due to regional demand in the Middle East, will still drive long-term investments and unconventional activity across the international market.
David Anderson: Thank you. And perhaps we can shift the focus a little bit on the production side of the business. This is an area where kind of in your portfolio is becoming a bigger part of the mix as you added in Aker and as we're pulling in ChampionX going forward. You highlighted kind of pro forma, it was about 9% year-on-year growth, kind of excluding Aker in overall Production Systems. Looking forward, how are you viewing sort of the growth trajectory of, kind of, the overall production driven business? Should that be high -- I mean 9% as a starting point, where does it go from here when you kind of fold everything in? Is this like a -- do you see kind of high-single digit, low double-digit going forward? Do you have enough visibility to kind of help us understand that? Because that needs to be the part of your business that could be showing much greater growth in the next few years.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think as you have seen our commentary, Production Systems will be having positive growth driven by this production recovery. We are seeing that Reservoir Performance is pulled this year by intervention and stimulation production recovery activity. So, these things are here to stay. The investment we're making in technology, investment we are making in our portfolio, the investment we are making creating integration opportunity in this space is resulting this year into visible growth pull in the Middle East across the broader basin. So, we are very positive that this will become a long-term earnings potential for us. It will become more and more a backlog driven significant part of our mix in the long-term, be it related to OpEx or be it related to long cycle CapEx. So, we are very constructive about the long-term future of production and recovery. This is a grand challenge, I would say, that the industry is facing to ultimately increase the recovery and demonstrate that digital integration and fit technology can uplift the recovery factor of most of the basins and can improve the production of existing producing assets. And it's true from U.S. shale to Middle East to basin -- deepwater basin. So, I think this is something that we are strategically investing into from technology, from portfolio. And that's something where we are starting to see the benefits as this year indeed the production recovery across the Reservoir Performance, across Production Systems, and in Digital will outpace the growth we see from exploration development in 2025, and expect this to continue going forward.
David Anderson: Great. Thank you very much.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Dave.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citi. Your line is open.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: The color on the markets -- good morning. I guess following up on Dave's question, just around the outlook for international activities and revenues, do you expect a normal sequential improvement in 2Q, or the second half of the year is going to be a little bit higher weighted? Kind of just how do you see the shape of the year progressing? Is it normal or a little bit more kind of second half weighted?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I think it's fair to assume that we see the typical pattern of a low first quarter followed by a rebound in the second half and followed by later in the year strong activity in part in some resource plays and including the upside that we foresee that could materialize in deepwater. But yes, I think it's an H2 higher activity and higher I would say upside to some extent following an H1 pattern that will have a low in Q1 resulting from the seasonal effect and also resulting from the sequential decline from some of the highs we had in the fourth quarter as you may have seen with our record high international revenues.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And are you able, at this juncture to comment on Russia and the continuity of your operations there? Have you ever had a chance to digest the latest sanctions’ language and I think you may provide an update of just to the kind of overall contribution of the business?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. Let me comment on this. Our revenue in Russia continues to decline and accounted for 4% of our global revenue in 2024 down from 5% in previous year. And as you know, since the start of the conflict, we have taken voluntary measures to curtail our Russia activity, including halting shipments of product and technology into Russia from all SLB facilities worldwide in 2023. And actually, we are reviewing the new U.S. sanctions and at this point, we believe that our voluntary measures align with the new sanctions.
Scott Gruber: Great. I appreciate the color. I'll turn it back. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Arun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning. Olivier, I wanted to see if you could provide maybe a little bit of clarity around the updated outlook for 2025. Is it fair you expect flattish revenue on a standalone basis and adjusted EBITDA at or above 2024 levels? Is that -- I just want to make sure that I have that correct.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think this is -- you correctly captured what we prepared and disclosed in our prepared remarks. Indeed, we foresee that the mix of activity both in Russia and in the U.S., the mix of the give and takes that are very contrasted this year will result into a flat also revenue outlook globally and will result into also our ability to deliver earnings EBITDA dollar to be at or above 2024, excluding -- all of this, excluding ChampionX.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. Got it. And just maybe you could clarify -- elaborate, you mentioned how in some of your non-oil and gas segments, low-carbon solutions, carbon capture minerals, data center solutions that you're seeing, what could be some significant growth in 2025. Can you just provide maybe a little bit of thoughts? I think you cited the $850 million number for 2024. What kind of growth could we see off that level?
Stephane Biguet: I'll take this. This is Stephane. So, yes, just to unwrap it a little bit that more than $850 million is made of low carbon activities, for example, carbon sequestration, and capture and geothermal, as well as new activities we have started in 2024, which relate to the data center infrastructure solution. So, all together in 2024, this was more than $850 million. And just to clarify, some of these activities are recorded as part of our Core business, such as carbon sequestration, geothermal, where we provide reservoir characterization, drilling services, or even digital solutions. So, some of it is captured in the relevant Core divisions or in Digital. And some of the other activities, such as carbon capture, like our Capturi™ joint venture is captured under the Other category in our divisional reporting. So, this is just to clarify. Now going forward, this is growing very fast, faster than our Core business. So, this is providing another way to offset some of the headwinds on the Core business. And it's particularly growing on the CCS side, on the geothermal, and those data center infrastructure solutions I mentioned.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Neil.
Neil Mehta: Hi, Olivier, Stephane. I just wanted -- morning, my friend. I just want to talk about the share repurchase program. You indicated that you wanted to accelerate the authorization. And how do you think about taking advantage of some of the volatility in the stock and you said at least $4 billion. So, how do you think about capturing upside to the extent the free cash flow materializes?
Stephane Biguet: Sure, Neil. So, first, you mentioned it. Our goal here with especially the accelerated share transaction, is to take advantage of what we believe is a low valuation for our stock as we -- especially as we start the year. So, mechanically, what we did is, we paid $2.3 billion upfront to the banks which are helping us with this program. We paid that $2.3 billion actually earlier this week. And we received delivery on January 13, exactly, of approximately 48 million shares of our stock. And this represents about 80% of the total shares to be bought under the program. So, those shares, those 48 million shares were delivered to us and are now removed from our outstanding share count. Now, there will be a true-up in the next few months before the end of May. The banks go at their pace, but the deadline is end of May. There will be a true-up based on the volume weighted average price of the shares minus the discount. And then we will receive the remaining shares. So, with all this, there's 2.3 billion of shares that can be removed right away from our outstanding share count and at what we believe is a very favorable price. To the second part of your question, that $2.3 billion is to take care of the majority of what we include in the total $4 billion returns to shareholders. So, we mentioned this $4 billion is indeed a minimum. We do have the option to increase. We will -- if we increase this $4 billion, it will be only in the form of additional buybacks. So, we will -- we can go -- we will go a bit above the $2.3 billion because this was just a high level estimate of the total for the year. So, we will go slightly above, but we can go even beyond that to exceed the $4 billion total returns to shareholders. We'll decide this as the year unfolds, depending on how much the ChampionX businesses, for example, will contribute to free cash flow once the transaction closes, depending on our free cash flow performance in the year and potential M&A opportunities. But there is clearly the option to increase that $4 billion total returns.
Neil Mehta: Okay. That's very helpful. And then the follow-up is just, can you talk about where we stand in helping the market better isolate the value of the Digital business? I know Canada was an important piece of it, and then maybe post ChampionX, there could be some segment -- re-segmenting. So, just how do we think about that $3 billion number and when we can get a little bit more clarity about the multiyear outlook for it on a standalone basis?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah, Neil. I think we are still very confident that the dynamic we are witnessing and we are leveraging to grow our Digital business across the different elements that we have in offering will continue across the rest of the decade. We will continue to be accretive, as we have said, from the margin. And yes, we'll be in a position and we'll decide in the coming months or quarters the best way to provide further disclosure and appropriate disclosure so that you and everybody can understand how this is being built and understand the making of Digital, the actual performance of Digital, accretive. And we will, in due time, project beyond 2025 and set our ambition for the years to come and highlight that we believe that the market leadership position we have taken, the platform approach we have, the combination of Digital operation workflow, and the first mover advantage we have had in Cloud and AI will continue to contribute to give us tailwind and accretive growth across the rest of the decade, clearly above and beyond the upstream market spent going forward. So, we see this as a very advantageous position that we have that we'll give enough disclosure detail too, so that everybody understands not only the making of, but also the trajectory, the trends, and the actual performance, underlying performance for margins and capital.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Neil.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Saurabh Pant: Thank you. Good morning, Olivier and Stephane. If you don't mind, I'll start with a clarification. Thank you. If you don't mind, I'll start with a clarification to Arun's clarification. So, it's a double clarification, but the 2025 guide, that does still include the Palliser asset in Canada, right, because that sale has not closed yet.
Stephane Biguet: So, yeah, that transaction has not closed. So, yes, we -- but still, the guide includes the divestiture of Canada after the few months we still need or potentially the few weeks we still need to close the transaction.
Saurabh Pant: Right. No, I got that, that's what I was guessing. Okay, perfect. And then, Olivier, I want to touch a little bit on pricing, like, you said across your portfolio, some markets are going up, some are going down. And as a result, the '25 outlook is about flattish, but what does that mean for pricing? We all know the industry you, your peers have been very disciplined in terms of CapEx deployment and capacity deployment this cycle. But are there any pockets where pricing is, or is likely to soften as we move through '25? Should investors be worried about that?
Olivier Le Peuch: Well, I think I believe that the market remains capital disciplined. The market internationally being at the cycle high in terms of activity remains stretched in terms of capacity. You have a combination and here we support pricing to be resilient. Now, obviously, it's a competitive market. And we are seeing this, but I think I trust that the pricing trend is not necessarily inflecting, considering that the market is still at activity high internationally. And I think we have the benefit of performance technology and integration capability that are giving us the ability to defend and support our pricing going forward. So, I'm constructive on this.
Saurabh Pant: Okay. Fantastic. And if I can sneak one more in very quickly, like, you said the cycle is maturing, right? And this seems like it should be a good opportunity for the industry, including SLB to go back and assess the cost structure, right? So, if I'm thinking about the self-help side of the equation, taking cost out, is there some opportunity that you have, Olivier, over the next year or so to look at your cost structure, and maybe something comes out of it that can help your margins, if you can talk to that a little bit?
Stephane Biguet: So, I'll take this, Saurabh. So, first, we have progressed quite well in executing the program we initiated mid-last year, which as you may remember, covered both the adjustment of operational resources in certain geographies and the optimization of our support structure. So, that first set of action is almost complete. And it's what supported our margin expansion in the third and fourth quarter of last year. And you can see that, by the way, particularly in digital, with our D&I margins reaching 38% in Q4, compared to 34% in the same period of the previous year. So, those action will, of course, those first set of actions will continue to support margins going forward. Beyond the specific cost out program, we are, of course, continuously monitoring both the operational resources and the support resources versus our activity levels, as well as versus efficiency benchmarks that we set for ourselves. So, yes, this may result into additional adjustments as necessary in certain parts of the organization. This is really one of the key levers to protect or improve our margins. And with certain digital -- additional digital tools we have in our functional back office, etc., we still have efficiencies to extract.
Saurabh Pant: Okay. Fantastic. That's great color. Okay, Olivier, Stephane, thank you. Thanks for that. I'll turn it back.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Saurabh.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Yeah. Thank you, and good morning. Congrats on the quarter and glad to see the accelerated share repos. What I'd like to dig into just maybe a little deeper here on the digital side, I know you've already answered a few questions on it, but I'm just curious, as you look at the business here, what are some of the things we should focus on in terms of growth opportunities, right? You highlighted a series of contracts or collaborations that move forward during the fourth quarter. But is the limitation on growth here, to the extent one exists, a function of internal resources, be that people or capital? Is it any hesitancy from the customers, is their hesitancy to spend overall affecting what they're willing to spend on the digital side?
Olivier Le Peuch: Well, I think let me first describe and clarify the vector of growth that we see, the growth pathways to digital. And I think I would summarize it in three buckets. First, digital operation, the ability we have to provide products or to provide services and solutions to help our customers extract efficiency in drilling, in production, in producing assets, and to transform the way we operate and to transform the way they operate. And I think here it comes in the form of products that we sell that help the customer automate their operations and extract value and/or it comes to the form of the service solution we are setting, such as the one that you may have seen in one of our press release statements, that is the Neuro™ autonomous geosteering. And hence, we are creating a unique value and selling it one well at a time, and one customer at a time. And then the adoption will come from the success and the value we demonstrate to our customers. So, that's the first bucket is digital operation at large. This is the fastest growing segment we have seen in the last couple of years, and we expect this to be still growing. And the rate adoption depends on the value we demonstrate, and the ability we have to connect to the digital operations, workflows for the customers, and do it for every well, and do it for every pad, for every producing asset, and every rig. And I think this is happening at scale. The only limit is the infrastructure to untangle when we want to connect to the rig or connect to the asset. But I think this is happening, we recognize a lot of success in this, and this is decoupled completely from the CapEx and OpEx spend. This is a discretionary and supplemental spend that customers are committing to when they see that the value can be extracted. The second bucket is the cloud transition. We have initiated this cloud transition by creating a unique platform, the industry-leading platform, Delfi™, that allows a customer to get the benefit of cloud computing at scale, and to create new workflows on the cloud. And this adoption is coming one customer at a time. It depends on, again, the balance of on-prem and cloud transition. We offer hybrid support to our customers, and you may have seen during the last few months and two quarters, we keep adding one customer at a time adoption. This is a long tail of customer adoption. We have 1,500 customers in our Digital portfolio. We have 200 of them now starting to transition to the cloud, and we expect there are another 1,000 that will, over the years to come, continue to transition. And every time we transition, we see an uplift into our SaaS and into our total revenue. And again, this is a transition from desktop and on-prem to cloud capability that customers will continue to do to extract efficiency into their own geoscience (ph), into their own workflow, from exploration to production. And finally, we have been unlocking a new market by creating a new platform called Lumi™ on data and AI that creates the benefit of connecting unstructured data, connecting cloud and on-prem datasets, very complex datasets, both from exploration to -- and that's unique, that's domain-rich, and customers are realizing this, and we are seeing a pick-up in adoption of this. And as customers not only want to unlock the power of the data and use -- and look for a platform that can do this openly and with scale, but also they want to get access to an AI platform. And we offer a domain-engineered AI capability and a platform capability that we offer to our customers. So, here you have a combination of digital operation, cloud transition, and data and AI that give us multiple growth paths that are all independent and decoupled from the CapEx and OpEx spend, as we see, as you can see here, our ambition is still very high on a market that is about flat.
Roger Read: I appreciate that. Great description. I'll turn it back there.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Your line is open.
Kurt Hallead: Hey. Good morning, everybody.
Stephane Biguet: Hey, Kurt.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, Olivier. I think what I'd like to do is maybe follow up on Roger's line of questioning with a focus on the digital, but maybe even kind of get down to the -- maybe an update on the adoption rate that you've seen with respect to Lumi, and some of the -- if you have some early success stories that you can potentially reference. And I think when you guys had talked about this last September, you saw some pretty significant growth opportunities in your potential customer base going from maybe 300 customers to 1,500 customers or something along those lines. So, maybe just an update on Lumi first would be great.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. No, Lumi, I think we are very pleased. I think we launched this less than four months ago, so it's early, early days. But I think the interest, the pilots, number of pilots we have is very, very strong. And I think, again, it's both the customer that are interested in connecting their datasets and unlocking the power of data to production workflow or to geoscience workflow, and also the customer that are interested into getting access to our AI platform with GenAI and -- or engineering AI capability set. So, –while you are seeing this, it’s too early to disclose numbers in terms of revenue and in terms of growth rate, because it's -- we are talking weeks, okay, post-launch. But I think we are very -- we have been very pleased with the take-up, with the interest, with the intake, and with the number of pilots that we have. And you have a few customers across the world that you will see will continue to adopt Lumi going forward, and you will see examples it will give of using AI into your operation to optimize assets. And you will see more and more examples of customers adopting this just for their benefit and for playing with or using AI as a capability set beyond what we can offer directly on our rigs, what we can offer directly on our producing assets. So, I'm confident. It's too early to give you numbers, but I think the trend is very interesting, and the early feedback, early number of pilots and early adoption to test and explore what can this do is very, very good.
Kurt Hallead: Great. Appreciate that. And maybe follow up just on full circle on the macro. We talked through the dynamics for this year and how things appear to be kind of mapping out and predicated on your commentary about a rebalance in the oil market on the horizon and boding well for investment through the end of the year. Just how do you think it could all play out? Do you think your customer base is getting a little bit more wary than they were about project economics, or is this more of a just a tap the break, let's digest what we've done, and then we can kind of start -- if you will, start jogging again in 2026?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I think that first and foremost, I think the adjustment that we have seen in the last six months, I think was driven by the oversupply, the concern about the oversupplied market, and hence a cautious approach on both the timing for FID, the cautious approach on discretionary spending that are translating to a moderated -- moderating pace of growth, in part in the international market and a continuation of a compression of activity in the U.S. Now the outlook, both from the long-term rebalance, from the gas energy playing in the data center and the global energy security, will all combine to pull this through. So, whether some of it materializes at the end of this year, an early pick-up in deepwater, or a higher level of short cycle activity in the second half of the year will depend on the macroeconomics. But I think directionally, as we said, we see an outlook which is steady, flat year-on-year, and we see the signal, the early signs of long-term upside in '26 driven by deepwater FID, driven by the continuous gas, including unconventional, and driven by short cycle that will have to come back in full play to sustain this production going forward.
Kurt Hallead: That's awesome. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stephen Gengaro: Hi. Thanks, and good morning, everybody.
Stephane Biguet: Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Stephen Gengaro: Two things for me. The first is, when we think -- you dug into this a little bit at the beginning of the call, but when we think about the -- maybe the margin profile of the different segments in 2025, can you just give us some flavor for how you're thinking about the puts and takes in the different segments?
Olivier Le Peuch: We typically don't guide, and we're not aiming to guide, I think, but you can understand that the mix is slightly changing, as we commented that the growth in the Core, the growth of Production Systems and Reservoir Performance will be offset by the decline in Well Construction, so you can do the math and understand the consequence of this. You also understand that Digital & Integration to the benefit of Digital growth will have margin expansion, so you do all of this and you get a different mix than last year. You add the cost-out program and our discipline that we need to reinforce on pricing to match our ambition to maintain earnings at or above the level that we delivered in 2024, excluding ChampionX.
Stephen Gengaro: Okay. Great. No, that's helpful. And then just, my follow-up question was, just your perspective on what's happening in Mexico, what you sort of think about when you think about Mexico and maybe the prospects for a recovery maybe in '26 or later?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it's too early to call. I think this -- the government, the budget and the leadership team of PEMEX is under transition. I think what is clear is that Mexico activity will decline and has already declined. This is offset in Latin America by Argentina and Brazil, so it's something that we have a diversified portfolio across Latin America. This is our strength, and I think the belief that we will leverage the growth in select countries, whether it's resilience or growth, as indicated particularly in Argentina, and resilience or growth in Brazil to offset the exposure that we foresee in Mexico, but it's too early to call the outlook and outcome of the election, change of leadership, and the priority of the government towards PEMEX.
Stephen Gengaro: Okay. No, great. Thank you for the color.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: I will turn the call over to SLB for closing comments.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Kate. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, our 2024 results underscore the strength of SLB's diverse portfolio to navigate evolving market dynamics. Moving forward, we'll continue to harness our unique market exposure and performance advantage to further our margin expansion journey, deliver strong cash flows, and increase returns to shareholders. Second, we remain focused on expanding the value we create for our customers through our technology leadership, integration capabilities, offshore exposure, and an expanded production and recovery portfolio through the announced acquisition of ChampionX. Finally, I'm confident in our strategy, inclusive of the progress we are making going beyond oil and gas, and in our ability to continue creating value for our customers, partners, and shareholders. With this, I will conclude today's call. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-18 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you everyone for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter SLB Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James R. McDonald, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs. Please go ahead.
James McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York, following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. For more information, please refer to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third- quarter press release, which is on our website. And finally, in conjunction with our proposed acquisition, SLB and ChampionX have filed materials with the SEC, including a registration statement with a proxy statement and prospectuses. These materials can be found on the SEC’s website or from the parties’ websites. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us this morning. During the call, I will cover a few topics. I’ll start by reviewing our third-quarter results. Then, I will discuss how we are leveraging our differentiated market positioning, digital leadership, and operating efficiency to navigate the evolving macro environment. And finally, I will provide an update on our full-year financial ambitions and our early outlook for 2025. Stephane will then provide additional details on our financial results, and we will open the line to your questions. Let’s begin. SLB delivered strong third quarter results with continued margin expansion. Sequentially, although revenue was flat, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by more than 50 basis points to 25.6% by driving efficiencies throughout the business and we generated very strong free cash flow of $1.81 billion. In the international markets, revenue remained steady sequentially despite lower reactivity as commodity prices resulted in a more cautious approach to discretionary short cycle spending. Demand for SLB's digital products and services continued to accelerate and we saw continued growth in the Middle east and Asia, fueled by oil capacity expansions and strong gas activity as well as offshore projects. Meanwhile, revenue in Europe and Africa was largely unchanged as strong production and recovery activity in North Africa was offset by a decline in Latin America following a strong second quarter. Turning to North America, revenue increased 3% sequentially as higher offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico was partially offset by lower drilling activity in U.S. land as the market remained constrained by gas prices and ongoing capital discipline by operators. Next, let me touch on the performance of the Divisions. In Digital & Integration, we delivered strong sequential growth led by our digital business, which reached a new quarterly revenue high. We also continued to increase profitability, expanding our pretax segment operating margin to 36%, driven by higher digital revenue and cost optimization. Overall, our digital business remains on pace to achieve full-year revenue growth in the high teens, and we announced a number of exciting new products and partnerships during the quarter that I will discuss a little later in today’s call. Turning to the Core divisions, Production Systems continues to grow, benefitting from long-cycle development activity, particularly in the Middle East & Asia and in the Gulf of Mexico. I was proud to see that most Production Systems business lines contributed to this performance, as we continued to secure sizable bookings, while also increasing our backlog for the future. Reservoir Performance remained steady, supported by stable production and recovery spending, and Well Construction declined slightly, due to weaker land activity in North America and in the international markets. Overall, these results demonstrate SLB’s unique ability to navigate the evolving market by leveraging our differentiated international and offshore positioning, our broad technology portfolio, and our continued focus on capital discipline and operating efficiency. I want to thank the SLB team for continuing to deliver for our customers and shareholders in this dynamic environment. I am extremely proud of their contribution and dedication to our performance strategy. Next, I wanted to share some updates on our progress in digital. We delivered another quarter of strong digital growth as operators continued to increase their investments in digital technology to reduce cycle times and risk, enhance productivity, lower costs and carbon, and accelerate returns. This is presenting opportunities for high margin growth, and we have taken a leading role in this space, partnering with our customers to accelerate their transition to the cloud, scaling new technology for drilling and production operations, and creating new markets by delivering disruptive solutions for data and AI. As part of this journey, we hosted our Digital Forum in September, where we brought more than 1,000 customers and partners to innovate solutions and shape our shared digital future. During this event, we launched the Lumi data and AI platform, which will accelerate advanced data and generative AI capabilities at scale for SLB’s customers across the energy value chain. Today, we offer approximately 150 AI and machine learning capabilities across our products and solutions, and we continue to work with our customers and partners to innovate and deploy new ones. We also unveiled a number of cross-industry announcements during the Forum. Theis includes a collaboration with NVIDIA to develop generative AI solutions for energy, as well as a partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand access to applications from the Delfi digital platform and to evaluate decarbonization solutions for Amazon’s digital infrastructure. Each of these agreements helps to expand our capability set and positions SLB as a key partner in digital and sustainability across the industry. Next, let me discuss the macro environment. Over the past few months, commodity prices have been under pressure. This is largely due to concerns of an oversupplied market, driven by higher output from non-OPEC+ producers, uncertainty around OPEC+ supply releases, weaker demand from China, and softer economic growth rates in the U.S. and Europe. This has resulted in a cautionary approach to activity and discretionary spend by many customers as highlighted in our third-quarter results. Despite these evolving market conditions, we believe the long-term fundamentals for oil and gas remain in place. Demand for energy is increasing and energy security remains a global priority, as witnessed by recent commodity price fluctuations tied to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In this environment, gas will continue to play an increasing role in the energy transition, while oil will remain a large part of the energy mix for decades to come. Internationally, gas investment remains strong, particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and the North Sea, and is expected to grow regardless of OPEC+ decisions on oil production. Meanwhile, while short-cycle oil investments have been more challenged, long-cycle deepwater projects globally and most capacity expansion projects in the Middle East remain economically and strategically favorable. Specific to North America, we do not see U.S. activity rebounding in the near term, and any potential increases in gas rigs could be quickly offset by a further decline in oil rigs due to increased operating efficiency. Overall, we expect this to result in a sustained level of global upstream investment in the years to come, with the secular trends of digital and industry decarbonization extending the investment horizon. SLB is well positioned to navigate in this evolving macroenvironment through our differentiated portfolio and multipronged strategic approach across Core, Digital, and New Energy. With that backdrop, let me conclude my opening remarks by sharing our outlook for the full year 2024 and our early thoughts regarding 2025. Specific to the fourth quarter, we expect muted revenue growth, with a favorable mix of year-end digital and product sales partially offset by E&P budget exhaustion in U.S. land and cautious discretionary spending from certain international customers. And, with continued cost optimization, we anticipate we will deliver EBITDA margin expansion in the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2024, ongoing margin expansion will enable us to deliver full-year adjusted EBITDA margins at or above 25%. Additionally, our strong cash flows, coupled with the announced sale of our Palliser asset in Canada, will support increased returns to our shareholders. In 2025, we see the potential for upstream spending in the international markets to grow in the low to mid-single digits, while North America spending will be flat to slightly down. This directional outlook will depend on the geopolitical environment and commodity prices, and we will share an updated view in January after we receive more feedback on customer budgets. In conclusion, SLB remains well positioned to deliver strong financial results, as our optimized cost structure, portfolio rationalization, differentiated exposure to key international and offshore markets, and digital leadership will support further margin expansion, higher cash generation, and increased returns to shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third-quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.89. This represents an increase of $0.04 sequentially and $0.11, or 14%, when compared to the third quarter of last year. During the quarter we recorded $0.02 of merger and integration charges relating to the Aker subsea and ChampionX transactions and $0.04 of charges in connection with the program we started last quarter to realign and optimize the support and service delivery structure in certain parts of our organization. Overall, our third-quarter revenue of $9.2 billion was essentially flat sequentially. However, the third quarter represented another quarter of both sequential and year-on-year margin expansion despite revenue growth rates moderating. These improvements were driven by very strong Digital & Integration margins combined with the effect of the cost optimization program I just mentioned. Additionally, the resilient, long-cycle Production Systems business continued its top line growth and margin improvement journey, benefiting from its strong backlog. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margin expanded 48 basis points to 20.8%. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin increased 55 basis points to 25.6%, representing the highest level since the first quarter of 2016. Let me now go through the third-quarter results for each Division. Third-quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1.1 billion increased 4% sequentially with margins expanding 456 basis points to 35.5%. The sequential revenue growth was entirely due to higher digital sales, as APS revenue was flat. The strong margin performance was driven by improved digital profitability as a result of the higher uptake of new digital solutions and the optimization of our digital support and delivery structure. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.8 billion was flat sequentially as higher intervention activity in international markets was offset by lower evaluation revenue in Latin America and the Middle East. Margins contracted 53 basis points due to the unfavorable technology mix. Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion decreased 3% sequentially on lower rig count in U.S. land and Saudi, and the completion of drilling projects in certain offshore markets. Margins decreased 19 basis points as a result of the lower activity. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $3.1 billion increased 3% sequentially driven by higher sales of surface production systems, completions, and artificial lift, led by North America and the Middle East & Asia. Margins expanded 110 basis points to 16.7% on improved profitability in artificial lift, completions, surface and midstream production systems. With regard to our liquidity, our cash flow performance during the third quarter was very strong, as we generated $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.8 billion. This represents a $1 billion increase in free cash flow as compared to last quarter, largely due to significant customer collections. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $644 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.6 billion. On the M&A front, as announced yesterday, I am pleased to report that we have signed a definitive agreement to sell our interests in the Palliser APS project in Canada. This transaction will reduce our direct exposure to commodity prices and the associated earnings volatility as well as reduce our capital intensity. It also allows us to eliminate significant future abandonment liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive cash proceeds of approximately $430 million U.S. dollars, subject to closing adjustments that are typical for such a transaction. This transaction will also result in us removing asset retirement obligations from our balance sheet with a present value of approximately $280 million. This transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close before the end of this year. Turning to the pending ChampionX acquisition, the integration teams on both sides have been working together closely, and we are extremely pleased with the progress they are making. We now anticipate the transaction to more likely close in the first quarter of 2025. Finally, total returns to shareholders, in the form of stock repurchases and dividends, was approximately $2.4 billion on a year-to-date basis. During the third quarter, we repurchased 11.3 million shares for a total purchase price of $501 million. As a result of our strong cash flow performance, we expect to maintain this level of buyback in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we will exceed our previous commitment to return $3 billion to our shareholders in 2024. Furthermore, we reaffirm that we will return a minimum of $4 billion to shareholders in 2025, reflecting our confidence in our ability to continue generating strong cash flows. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, we will open the floor to your questions.
Operator: Operator Instructions] And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: So, Olivier, obviously, more muted top line growth as we go through '25 is kind of expected here, but you guys have a lot of initiatives underway that will drive, I think, margin -- continued margin journey, margin expansion journey, I guess, is a better way to put it. Could you talk about some of the drivers there and how you see -- maybe you or Stephane, how you see that unfolding as we go through the year? I know you don't want to give too many specifics yet on the year given the budgets being quantified, but just maybe help us a little bit on how this could unfold.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Good question. Thank you, James. So yes, indeed, we have the ambition to maintain our margin expansion journey as we enter 2025 or exit rate of 2024, with the results we have delivered in Q3, the ambition we have and the statement we have made on further expansion in the fourth quarter will bode very well as we enter 2025 to start the year with a kick if I may. And now looking forward, I think the guidance at this point, market spend will indicate that they will benefit from another year of international growth outpacing North America, which again and plays in our favor from the margin mix. And obviously, the combination of our digital tech -- technology premium will continue to play favorably as we accelerate technology introduction and continue the journey and ambition, we have on the on digital to reach approximately $3 billion on the and some of a year of strong growth. And finally, I think we have initiated some cost out and operating efficiency focus for our team, entire team and this is already falling through into our results, and I expect this to take full scale in 2025.
James West: Got it. Okay. Great. And then, now that we're a little over a month out from your digital forum that you held recently, could you maybe share some of your initial thoughts on the success of the form. It seemed to me at least that the uptake in digital. Clearly, you just mentioned $3 billion in revenue. But for next year, but digital uptake is accelerating and the quality of the digital uptake, not just going to cloud, but also using all the AI tools is accelerating as well. But I wanted to get your, now that we've gotten on the way your thoughts on that.
Olivier Le Peuch: No, fair. I think first, I'm very pleased to report that this was most likely on many aspects, our best forum ever. And from the size, the scale of the attendance, number of partners that came to join us, the number of customers that came and display their own technology. I think we're having the opportunity -- we had the opportunity to show the digital value proposition we offer in industry across the different domains from [geoscience] subsurface to operations, show it that we have an integrated platform, open platform approach with partners, and they are extending our technology from the historical on-prem to cloud edge and now AI, including Gen AI. So, I think this resulted into not realization by many customers that we can impact all aspects of the operation, unlock value in productivity, in the geoscience space, in operation for performance, and in reducing cost and carbon going forward. So, the pickup, if any, that I have is that this market in terms of TAM will expand going forward with accelerated expansion as customers realize that there is maturity into offering. There is maturing to the partnership ecosystem that we have developed. And there is opportunity for them to capture this as they want to extract efficiency as they want to be more competitive. And I believe that our opportunity is to accelerate the adoption of the toolbox that we have invested in the last 10 years to particularly benefit from digital operation. There is one domain that I think has really blossomed in the last 18 months is digital operation in production, in drilling, autonomous operation, optimization, edge AI applications that are really game changing the way we can perform with our customers, and that's where I see the future. So longer term, going beyond the cycle, growing for the long term as a business for us.
Operator: Next question we have is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: So, the customers -- your customers are being more cautious though your projects are still moving ahead. It seems pretty clear the cycle is kind of plateauing here. International spending, you're saying that was low, mid-single digits next year. But if you look at the prior cycle, the second half of that was really driven by sustained deepwater development. So, my question is, do you think deepwater can once again be a driver of growth, say, beyond '25? We have something like 300 billion in FID in the last few years. You just announced a slew of Petrobras awards today, and I have Namibia and Suriname on the horizon. So, my question is, is that enough to drive growth overall spending higher? Or is it just really a function of the oil prices needs to structurally improve in order to kind of get this cycle kind of reaccelerating?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think you have seen the realization that when commodity price is under pressure, there is some pressure on short cycle that is suppressed and that may come back and will come back as soon because it impacts increased drilling, impacts intervention activity, it impacts short cycle and commercial in some region, but it will most likely come back as soon as the community price regain traction. But the long cycle, apart from some decision on timing and project execution have been untouched. And we have had a year of strong exploration activity that has unlocked new reserve, that has appraised new future pipeline of deepwater, as you have heard and seen across Americas, across South Africa, across the East Mediterranean and across Asia, where gas is critical. And the combination of these, as you know, is representing every year. This year, I think the total offshore FID will approach $100 billion, and we expect that this rate of $100 billion the FID for offshore will remain at that level or higher for the next two or three years. So, the cumulative over '23 to '26 of offshore will exceed $500 million of offshore FID and that's a sign that this project will execute beyond '25, beyond '26 and will be a growth engine for the industry going forward.
David Anderson: That's great to hear. Also, it's great to hear is the sale of the Palliser Block. Glad to put that behind us and now we can kind of focus much more on the digital business, of course, and I guess one of the things that you had talked about at that forum is that digital has been accretive -- is accretive to growth in margins going forward. And clearly, it's been that way already. So. you're well on your way to hitting your $3 billion target of revenue next year. And naturally, I have to ask you what's next. I don't think you're ready to give out the new target yet, otherwise, you probably would have already done that. But I guess I'm just wondering about is where do you see that growth coming from? You just talked about extended on that production side. So maybe that's another leg of growth. But a big part of this has been coming to from the well construction. And I'm wondering, if deepwater can be also a huge driver of the digital business going forward.
Olivier Le Peuch: It is already. I think we are already deploying our well construction automation and optimization, autonomous operations in some offshore rigs and making huge defense where the cost of rig operation matters, and this is something that will unlock the future. But I think I will split in the three categories. I think you have a platform transition, cloud transition that has happened that affects the more than 1,000, 1,500 customers we have, and it's a long transition that will continue to happen one customer at a time, cloud transition that will continue to drive our Delfi adoption across our customer space in [geoscience], and we'll continue to see this affecting and being a long cycle, a long period of growth for years to come as a driver. The second is, as you mentioned, as I mentioned, the digital operation, be it in production and drilling with the emergence of edge application, the emergence of autonomous optimization application, and this is both seen by the digital services that our core divisions offering, well construction, production system and reservoir performance with having much success with this digital offering that they are putting on the back of our Delfi, and we see it into the pickup of our production and drilling operation capability by the customers themselves. And finally, and the third leg of growth in our digital portfolio, is the emergence of new data and AI capability, as you have seen, the Lumi that we have put in place. So, we combine these three over the future horizon. This will continue to be digital. As a consequence, we continue to be a growing TAM for us and will be an engine of growth that will be accretive to the top line and will deliver accretive margin to the Company. So that's the way we see it. And I will not, at this point, set the target for the risk next, but we'll continue to see growth between '25 with this context.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: I'm glad to hear that you still see some growth next year. I want to ask a question that where we try to separate operating leverage that results in growth from other margin drivers. So, if we assume that upstream spending is flattish for the next three years, is there a certain level of margin expansion that you think you could achieve through further cost optimization and further growth in digital, I assume that you would challenge the organization to continue expanding margins and a flat backdrop. Just curious what that potential rate of margin improvement could be?
Stephane Biguet: Yes. First, we do see not only in Q4 and into 2025, further margin expansion on that upstream spending outlook. And as you actually mentioned, it comes from several components. It comes primarily, I would say, from the mix of activities in our various divisions. As Olivier indicated, digital is a booster to our overall company margins, technology mix, performance contract or performance in general pushes margins as well. And yes, there's an element of cost optimization, not only from the program, we started at the end of last quarter -- sorry, at the beginning of last quarter of Q3, but also from our continuous focus on cost, we will continue to adjust delivery resources based on level activities, and we will continue to look for further optimization in our structure. So, it's a mix of all these components that will continue to push our margins into 2025.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And Stephane, how would the financials be impacted by the Palliser sale? How much EBITDA comes on? How much CapEx comes out?
Stephane Biguet: Yes. So, we -- on Palliser, we generate approximately $500 million of revenue per year on the asset. And this comes with pretax margins in the in the high 30s. Now you mentioned something very important. It also removes quite a bit of investment that we need to inject every year to maintain this number. So, it's the CapEx is about $150 million per year. And as I mentioned as well in my prepared remarks, something not to underestimate is removing future abandonment liabilities, which discounted are about $280 million, but undiscounted are close to $1 billion. So that's -- it's a good thing. This is going away from our balance sheet and P&L, and it will reduce both earnings volatility and capital intensity.
Operator: Next, we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Olivier, you framed that you're seeing a little bit of cautiousness in some of the short-cycle markets, North America, international oil with some resiliency in long cycle gas and deepwater opportunities. I was wondering how -- if you could -- how would you characterize the price -- the current pricing dynamics internationally, just relative to your expectations of margin expansion from here?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we believe that the pricing environment is still positive, constructive, I would say. I think first, realizing that the industry is capital discipline. And the industry has no spare capacity to move and to place. And as a consequence, performance, technology and integration capabilities still give us opportunity to support our pricing, and I don't see it in the current environment changing very much.
Arun Jayaram: Fair enough. I had a follow-up on New Energy. You guys press release an update on your lithium DLE pilot in the quarter in Nevada, which highlighted a very high kind of recovery rate I was wondering if you could talk about alleviated the next steps to commercialize this technology. How competitive are the extraction costs today versus existing technologies? I wondering if you could just maybe frame the growth opportunity from lithium?
Olivier Le Peuch: Well, as you pointed out, I think first, we are very pleased to have achieved these milestones again, the milestone has been to produce lithium carbonate from our demonstration plant in Nevada using direct lithium extraction from brine and using a concentration and purification process that we have integrated with our own IP and using some external technology and putting this together and working for months to tune it to digitally optimize it and to realize this. So, our plan forward is to work with prospective partners and customers. to see how this technology can be used and to respond to big demand that exists and some plans that some of our customers and partners have announced to use DLE as a method to extract lithium and produce in large quantity in the coming years. So, we are looking forward to technology to scale it for application as a license technology or as a partner where we will develop and run going forward this technology with our customers and partners. That's the way we look into it. And again, very good first and benchmark performance for such a DLE plant and exciting prospect -- long-term prospect for us in this new space.
Operator: And our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Yes. A couple of financial questions. Maybe as we think about 2025 over the summer, you had talked about that $10 billion EBITDA target for '25 on a 20% CAGR. Just in light of some of the macro commentary, can you just talk about some of those moving pieces as it relates to that guide? And I think you've given us a lot of moving pieces, but I'd like to just kind of tie that out.
Stephane Biguet: So makes sense, Neil. So really, yes, again, margin expansion is -- we are laser focused on this. We've been increasing EBITDA margins for year-on-year for 15 consecutive quarters, and we don't intend to stop. So, this is our mission. And as I explained, it's made of several types of components. Now to your specific question on 2025 and the absolute value of EBITDA compared to our long-term '21 to '25 CAGR ambition, it is possible that indeed, with the current macro outlook again to be refined, and if we exclude for the moment just to compare apples to apples, with apple, sorry, if we exclude ChampionX, it's possible that the '21 to '25 CAGR will finish in the high teens rather than breaking that 20% bar.
Neil Mehta: That's really helpful. And then it was a super quarter for free cash flow. You guys beat our model by quite a bit, very strong collections. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about -- first of all, I'll talk about the go forward for working capital and just the free cash flow profile into next year as well, including CapEx, which has been, again, trending in a constructive way.
Stephane Biguet: Yes, totally. So yes, we maintain capital discipline for sure. So, this is -- this is quite predictable, and it's a bit too soon to talk about CapEx for next year, but rest assured it's going to -- the theme of capital discipline, clearly, will be there considering the macro environment. So now specifically to our Q3 free cash flow, yes, always in the second half, we generate most of the year of free cash flow. And in Q3, this was in a way more than exacerbate here. So yes, Q3 was very strong. And as we highlighted and as you mentioned, it's really -- it was really driven by customer collections. In a way Q2 was a little bit low on collections, so there's a bit of a catch-up effect. And Q4 will essentially be dependent on will be strong. It will also be dependent on customer collection. But as you can see, we do experience volatility in those collections from a quarter to another. So, we'll continue to push. We'll definitely finish the year high note as it relates to working capital and free cash flow work will continue to release as we finish the year. And going into next year, again, a bit too soon to give you a number for free cash flow, but definitely, it will be higher than 2024, not only from us, but of course, with the addition of ChampionX. And this is why we are quite comfortable to reaffirm or $4 billion target returns to shareholders for next year because free cash flow will increase in '25.
Operator: Next, we go to Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead. Mr. Hallead, do you have your phone muted?
Kurt Hallead: Olivier, you did highlight a more tempered outlook as you go to into 2025. So, we appreciate that. In the context of those dynamics, usually as the industry kind of goes into a more moderate growth or some markets kind of go into a little bit of a slowdown. There's some pricing pressures that maybe come along with that. Just wondering, if you're starting to see or starting to have some of those conversations with your customer base? And what -- if not, what may be different that's kind of driving the discussions with the customers to go around.
Stephane Biguet: Yes. I think in all cycle at any point in the cycle, I think we will always get under competitive pressure and under pressure from our customers to lower the cost of operation or improve product value. We believe that, I think, first and foremost, as long as we continue to perform credit value and exceed expectation on the performance of our operation, will relieve that any pressure that could come from a competitive and/or from a customer aspect. Secondly, we believe that the industry is tight on capacity, capacity of equipment, capacity of critical new technology. And the industry has demonstrated lately a strong capital discipline that has restrained this risk, I would say. But as long as I think -- as long as we maintain a very high customer satisfaction through our performance, continue to our technology, continue to deliver our integrated value proposition, I think we will relieve any pressure that could arise into a moderating growth environment and defend our pricing and further improve our pricing when it has it matters, and hence protect our margins going forward. So, it's a matter of execution. It's a matter of relationship, but it's also a matter of capital discipline across the industry. And I believe the condition in this cycle is a bit different than what we have suffered in the past, and I'm looking at this constructively.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That's great. That's great. Maybe a follow-up, coming full circle to your digital forum, a great event, by the way. What -- in the concept kind of the post meetings and so on and so forth, what were one or two things that came out of those meetings or discussions with potential clients of yours for your generative AI product. What was surprising to you that you maybe didn't anticipate going in?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think the customers were, I think, first, many of them participated themselves and 150 papers were presented by our customers, more than 10 of them presented their own application of digital to other customers. So, I think it was from a lot of learnings for customers to watch each other and to learn from each other and how do they use digital technology to unlock value. So, if take away, I think, at a high, high level, I think customer realized that we are more than just one [geoscience] application on the cloud, and we have a digital value proposition that expands across different domains and across different technology stack on-prem, cloud, edge AI and across the different dimension sensing and production. So, the full value proposition we have on digital, I think did surprise many of the customers as we continue to expand and have now a very comprehensive offering. That's the first takeaway, I think. The second is, I think the emergence of AI as x-factor for the industry to unlock more value of digital. This industry is data rich, I would say. And hence, we have deployed, as you heard, 150 engineered AI full of domain, full of physics, and full of the latest data science technique to unlock more performance into our digital application. And the latest announcement of Lumi as a platform that complements Delfi, and as a platform for putting an access in all E&P data in one framework to integrate all the applications across seamlessly. And finally, to create a framework that allow customer to use AI application on their datasets across the different domains and unlock new insights or create new performance. That's sort of Lumi data and AI is getting a lot of inbound requests as we have just announced it, and it will certainly be a factor of growth in the future as the industry recognized that there is a lot to unlock from data to liberate data and to realize value through AI including Gen AI application that we develop as you have heard with partners like NVIDIA, Mistral and others.
Operator: Next, we go to Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Saurabh Pant: I know there have been a lot of questions on digital, but I had one conceptual one, if you don't mind, Olivier. As we think about the upstream cycle maturing and growth slowing, I know digital has its own secular drivers, SLB specific drivers. So, growth in digital should be different versus upstream spending. But conceptually, Olivier, how should we think about the variance, the sensitivity to digital growth opportunity relative to what the upstream market is doing? So, if growth in upstream spending slows from 10% to, let's say, low to mid-single digit, does it do too much to digital growth outlook? Or they are materially unrelated to each other?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think as we are very early in the curve of adoption of digital, I believe, they are largely uncorrelated at this point. And we see the TAM, total addressable market of digital in our industry, in upstream actually growing as the market may be moderating from upstream CapEx. We believe that the size of digital will actually, by contrast, grow. And our ability to not only participate fully, but also gain share in this market and unlock white space in this market, such as with Lumi data and AI, and offer edge autonomous operation, I think will create for us a long growth opportunity that will be largely decorated. Now, there are aspects of short term, I would say, discretionary decision on that can affect digital. But I think the long trend, I think, I believe is positive and long trend will continue to be a secular investment opportunity for customers that now they're realizing creates value today and hence is an opportunity to differentiate their performance for tomorrow.
Saurabh Pant: Right, right. Okay. That makes a lot of sense, Olivier. And my follow up, Stephane, maybe for you. Obviously, you are accelerating cash return to shareholders. This year, you have your $4 billion -- at least $4 billion target for next year. But just conceptually, as we think about the percentage of your free cash flow that you might want to return to shareholders as the cycle matures. This year, it looks like you're going to be pretty close to 80%, which is a lot higher than your target. Conceptually, is it fair to assume Stephane that, that percentage of free cash flow continues to go up as the cycle matures?
Stephane Biguet: Well, you know, it is true. We set the minimum a few years back of 50%. So, yes, we have clearly exceeded that, and I'm quite happy we were actually able to exceed that. So, I mean, it really depends on investment opportunity. I think 80% is already a very good number. It's hard to tell you if it can get to 100% in 2025. I mean, it's really. We are happy with where our balance sheet is. Deleveraging has been a focus for a few years. We have turned that focus from deleveraging to return. So, depending on investment opportunities, returns to shareholders remains the priority at the moment. So, yes, you will see that percentage clearly above our initial short guidance of 50%. That's for sure.
Saurabh Pant: Yes. No, that's perfect. I was not expecting you to raise it to 80% from 50%, but essentially that all makes a lot of sense as Stephane. Thank you. I'll turn it back.
Operator: Next, we go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Roger Read: I'm going to come back to digital. It's the theme of the day. So let me ask the question slightly differently for you, Olivier, as you think about it. High growth, you've got to get customers on board. You've got to have the opportunities available internally, right in terms of people and offerings. So, as we think not just the growth rate in ‘25 to $3 billion. But beyond that, what do you see as potential bottlenecks be they internal or external, that you've really got to deal with here, the front and center items about having the right people in the right place and making the inroads to your client base.
Olivier Le Peuch: No, Roger, thanks for the question. I think there's nothing new. I think we have been working on going and understanding what can we do to unlock both from the go-to-market and from our own internal capability the digital growth. And I think we have been more success in the last few quarters. And I think it comes down to, I think engaging for customers, better understanding what I think, offering they are looking for. And I think this -- the going for multi-cloud going from hybrid cloud environment, on-prem and cloud, I think, has been an evolution that we have taken two to three years back, and I think it's paying off and is unlocking the growth. The other realization is that some customers don't necessarily are focused on the application, but I focus on data and they are willing to sort out and unlock the data. Hence, the operation of Lumi as a platform to address the customers that are more interested into unlocking data and directly accessing AI through a data platform as opposed to having to adopt the full suite. And I think we have seen this. We have done investment into our innovation factory to help collaborate for customers to tailor some fit-for-basin application to their needs. So, we have already gone through this. Is it all of cycle resolved? No. I think, as I said, it's one customer at a time, adoption on the cloud. However, I think there's something that help us a lot and I think is accelerating is the fact that digital operation led by our core division, production system, well construction and reservoir performance are becoming new agents of digital transformation for our customers, as they are pushing and getting successful into the adoption of digital services that are being delivered real time at the edge, such as autonomous drilling operation or wellbore insights or surveillance and optimization of some of our production system equipment. And this is one well at the time. This is one transaction at the time. So, the rate of adoption here, I think, and a push we have made to coalesce, if I may, are offering in the office, in the planning to offering into operation and at least under one umbrella of platform, I think, is unlocking the pace of adoption. And hence, we see this happening today, and we believe this will continue. So that's what we are doing to unlock, if you like, and working with partners to provide more options to our customers so that they recognize the ecosystem they work with. So, these are the two or three dimensions that we have worked with in the last 18 months, two or three years, and that are starting to bear fruits and starting to transfer into growth, and we don't see it changing going forward.
Roger Read: I appreciate that. Yes, it sounds like incremental and then eventually, we get to cascade with this. As a follow-up to that, Stephane, you mentioned capital intensity obviously declines with the sale here in the Canada E&P ops. What's the right way for us to think about capital intensity in terms of digital investments? Does it -- does capital and CapEx investment trail the revenue growth for a period of time, exceeded? Is there a way to think about maybe crossover eventually in that where the growth continues, but the capital intensity would decline? Or does it rely so much on capital investment elsewhere, there's not an easy way to think about that?
Stephane Biguet: So, it's clearly different from our core business. There's a little lag or a reasonable lag between investment CapEx in our core business and the related deployment of the tool in the field. In digital, it's a much longer cycle. So first, it's not CapEx. As you know, we expense all the investments because the investments are basically -- you can categorize them if you want, in product development, research and development, and this has been done over tempted to say the last years. So, there's always, of course, to come up with new solutions to enrich the platform. We need to continue investing every year. But we are not seeing spikes in there. We make our bit tragedies within given a lot. So, our growth in digital doesn't trigger incremental capital intensity because it's really smooth over many, many years. I would say that the heavy investments have been made in the past already now is just enriching the platform and supporting the enriched offering for the customer.
Operator: And our last question will come from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Stephen Gengaro: Two for me. The first, just sort of thinking about the short term in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the sort of the puts and takes as we look at the fourth quarter and maybe even versus sort of normal seasonality that we get every year? And I'm just also curious on the Gulf of Mexico, if there's been any big impact from the storm activity?
Olivier Le Peuch: Not sure we got your second question. You are concerned about -- the second part of your question.
Stephen Gengaro: Whether there's been much impact from the Gulf of Mexico storms.
Olivier Le Peuch: So, I will start with this to say that we have seen muted impact on the Gulf of Mexico storm in our operation, and the Gulf of Mexico has been a driver for growth in the third quarter sequentially. As it comes to the fourth quarter and your question, I think the puts and takes, I think, yes, there is an element of seasonality, both on the positive side, which is the digital and product from production system year-end sales that will normally and will create a boost to our revenue. And there is a seasonality effect on some part of the Nova atmosphere that are starting to see either part of the sequence or budget exhaustion part in U.S. land we see an offset and I think these two, as we commented, will be partially offset and we see as a consequence muted growth going forward sequentially. But that's the puts and takes that we are seeing going forward.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. And then the second question was really -- I'm not sure you're willing to comment on this, but as you've mentioned earlier, you've kind of been going through the integration team on the CHX front. Has there been anything that you can talk about that has sort of increased or changed your thought process or optimism on the synergies?
Stephane Biguet: Well, we are -- as we said, we have been working quite a bit on both sides with the integration teams, and what we are seeing is really giving us even more confidence than we had originally on the transaction and on the synergies. So, we are not going to change our synergy target at this time, but we clearly confirm it, and we are quite happy with what we are seeing in that integration planning process.
Operator: And I'll turn the conference back to SLB for closing comments.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways: First, SLB remains well positioned to navigate commodity price fluctuations, benefiting from our unique operating footprint. Moving forward, we will continue to harness our technology deployment and integration capabilities to capture high margin opportunities in the international, deepwater, and gas markets. Second, our digital business remains a key differentiator in the industry. This will continue to drive higher margin growth while opening the door to new markets. And third, with our solid financial performance and focus on operating efficiency, we look forward to delivering further margin expansion, higher cash generation, and increased returns to shareholders. Thank you for joining us this morning. With that, I will conclude our call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-19 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you everyone for standing by. Welcome to the SLB Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James R. McDonald, Senior President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs. Please go ahead.
James McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from London following our board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. For more information, please refer to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. And finally, in conjunction with our proposed acquisition, SLB and ChampionX have filed materials with the SEC, including the registration statement with the proxy statement and prospectuses. These materials can be found on the SEC's website or from the parties' websites. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call. This was a very strong second quarter for SLB, showcasing our ability to harness the ongoing growth cycle while driving efficiencies throughout our business. During today's call, I will cover three topics. First, I will review our second quarter results. Then I will describe the dynamics of the cycle and how we are positioning our business for further growth and margin expansion. Finally, I will share our updated outlook for the full year and discuss our ongoing commitment to returns to shareholders. Stephane will then provide additional details on our financial results, and we will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. I'm very pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Sequentially, revenue increased 5%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 142 basis points, and we generated $776 million of free cash flow. These results were driven by continued growth momentum in international markets, with more than half of our international geo units posting the highest revenue quarter of the cycle. Overall, international revenue grew 6% sequentially, led by the Middle East and Asia, which continued to set new records with two-thirds, 8 out of 12, of the year units in the area posting record high quarterly revenue. This was fueled by capacity expansion projects, new gas developments and production and recovery investments across the region. Additionally, the ongoing strength of the offshore markets supported further growth in Europe and Africa as well as Latin America. This was particularly pronounced in deepwater basins, including Brazil, West Africa and Norway, where we continued to benefit from strong backlog conversion in OneSubsea. We also benefited from new project on land, notably in Argentina and North Africa. Meanwhile, in North America, revenue increased 3% sequentially. This was led by the Gulf of Mexico, where we saw increased running and higher digital revenue from sales of exploration data licenses. However, this sequential growth was partially offset by lower drilling in U.S. land as the market continues to be constrained by weaker gas prices, capital discipline and ongoing market consolidation. Next, let me describe how this growth played out across the divisions. In our core divisions, we continue to harness this cycle, with revenue growing 4% sequentially and pretax segment operating margins expanding by 120 basis points. Growth was led by our Production Systems and Reservoir Performance divisions, which visibly expanded margins due to the favorable conversion of backlog as well as many business line operating and record activity levels. Demand for our services and equipment is being further reinforced by the combination of long-cycle development activity and the acceleration of production recovery investments, particularly in the Middle East and Asia and Latin America. Well construction also grew sequentially, supported by offshore developments, although this was partially offset by weaker land activity in North America. Overall, the core divisions continue to deliver margin expansion, combining to post their 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year pretax segment operating margin expansion. Meanwhile, in Digital & Integration, I was very pleased to see highly accretive sequential growth, highlighted by our digital business, reaching a new quarterly high and supporting visible sequential margin expansion. This puts us on track to achieve our full year ambition of digital revenue growth in the high-teens. We have opportunities to build on this momentum as customers are increasingly choosing to partner with SLB to modernize their digital infrastructure, as you have seen in a number of announcements included in today's release. At the end of the second quarter, we had 6,900 users on the Delfi platform, an increase of 28% year-on-year. Additionally, the number of connected assets increased by 57%, and trailing 12-months compute hours increased by 43%. Combined with our first quarter results, SLB first half adjusted EBITDA grew in mid-teens compared to the same period last year, in line with our full year ambition. Moving forward, we will remain focused on driving quality revenue growth and leveraging operational efficiency to grow EBITDA, expand operating margins, generate robust cash flows and meet our commitment to return to shareholders. I'm here to clearly express my full gratitude to the entire SLB team for delivering such a strong second quarter and first half results. Next, let me describe how the market is evolving and the steps we are taking to capture profitable growth across the business. As the cycle continues, investments will increasingly be targeted to in the most resilient area of the market, including key international markets such as the Middle East and Asia and in offshore globally. In these areas, we are seeing long-cycle gas and deepwater projects, production and recovery activity to address natural decline and increased digital adoption to drive efficiency and performance. This is an optimal environment for our business, and we are seizing each of these opportunity. In the Middle East, in addition to the exposure to the oil capacity expansion program across the region, we continue to benefit from the acceleration and scale of investments in gas development, both conventional and unconventional, leveraging our fit-for-basin technology and differentiated integration capability. Offshore, we see the benefits of our OneSubsea JV as highlighted by the number of high value contracts awarded and partnership included in today's release. Through OneSubsea, we're helping customers unlock reserves and reduce cycle times through an extensive subsea production processing technology portfolio. And we are increasingly being offered the opportunity to partner with customers in early engineering phases to unlock the economics of the assets. In production and recovery, we are seeing customers embrace our offerings as they work to offset natural decline, extend performance and maximize the value of their producing assets. We have many solutions to help customers access resource to our production system and reservoir performance division, and this is showing up in the strong results these divisions are achieving. As this market continue to evolve, we expect to strengthen our portfolio to fully capture this growing opportunity through our pending acquisition of ChampionX. Finally, underpinning nearly everything we do is the power of digital and AI. In today's market, accelerating the time to returns and extracting new level of efficiency are top of mind for our customers. And they are increasingly recognizing that upscaling their digital infrastructures is key, is a key enabler in these areas, presenting us with significant opportunities for high margin growth. In summary, SLB is well-positioned across key resilient markets. We remain focused on expanding margins through quality revenue growth, and this is complemented by heightened focus on operating efficiency, support structure optimization and strategic resource allocation in certain markets to align with expected levels of activity going forward. To support these ongoing cost efficiency actions, we recorded a charge this quarter, and Stephane will share additional details on this topic later in the call. Overall, the positive market dynamics and our continued focus on operating efficiency present a strong backlog for continued outperformance. We look forward to enhancing these dynamics to deliver further growth and margin expansion in the second half of 2024 and in 2025. On that note, let me conclude my opening remarks by showing our updated outlook for the year. Based on our strong second quarter and first half results, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 14% to 15% and full year adjusted EBITDA margins at or above 25%. Specific to the third quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth in the low single-digits, enhanced by further margin expansion. This will accelerate as we move towards the end of the year, with visible increase in top-line growth and an uptick in margin expansion during the first quarter due to seasonally higher year end digital and product sets. Lastly, we've returned $1.5 billion to shareholders over the first quarter, through the combination of stock repurchase and dividends. In the second half of the year, we expect to generate higher EBITDA and strong cash flows, supporting our full year commitments. Directionally, we expect a strong exit of the year to position us for continued revenue growth, margin expansion and cash generation, reinforcing our commitment to continue returns to shareholders in 2025. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $9.1 billion, increased 5% sequentially, mostly driven by the international markets, led by the Middle East and Asia. Sequentially, our pre-tax segment operating margins expanded 135 basis points to 20.3%, as margins increased in each of our four divisions. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 25%, representing a sequential increase of 142 basis points. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 11% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. As a result, second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.85. This represents an increase of $0.10 sequentially and $0.13 or 18%, when compared to the second quarter of last year. During the quarter, we've recorded $0.01 of merger and integration charges relating to the Aker subsea transaction and $0.07 of charges in connection with a program that we have recently, started to realign and optimize the support and service delivery structure in certain parts of our organization. This includes adjusting resources as a result of lower activity levels in North America, centralizing certain digital delivery services and improving efficiency in our support structure. This program, which will result in additional charges in the third quarter, will drive further margin expansion in the second half of the year and into 2025. The related actions will be completed by the end of the year. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1.1 billion increased 10% sequentially, with margins expanding 435 basis points to 31%. The sequential revenue growth was entirely due to higher digital sales, as APS revenue was flat. The strong margin performance was driven by improved digital profitability, as a result of robust exploration data sales and the higher uptake of digital solutions. APS margins were essentially flat. We expect the digital revenue growth and margin expansion to continue in both Q3 and Q4. Reservoir performance revenue of $1.8 billion increased 5% sequentially, while margins improved 98 basis points to 20.6%. These increases were primarily due to strong growth internationally, led by higher activity in the Middle East and Asia. Well construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 1% sequentially, well margins of 21.7% increased 125 basis points, driven by strong measurements and fluids activity internationally. Finally, production systems revenue of $3 billion increased 7% sequentially, driven by the strong activity in the international markets led by Europe and Africa. Margins expanded 146 basis points to 15.6% on improved profitability in Subsea Production Systems and artificial lift. Now turning to our liquidity. Our cash flow was strong, as we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $776 million during the quarter. We expect our cash flow to continue to improve throughout the rest of the year. As a result, our free cash flow in the second half of this year will be materially higher than the first half. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $666 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.6 billion. As I mentioned last quarter, under the securities laws, we were prohibited from repurchasing our stock during the period between the mailing of the proxy in connection with the ChampionX acquisition and ChampionX's shareholders' vote. Following the shareholder vote in June, we have resumed our stock repurchase program. And during the quarter, we repurchased 9.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $465 million. During the first half of the year, total returns to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends were approximately $1.5 billion, representing half of our $3 billion commitment for all of 2024. Finally, we issued $1.5 billion of bonds during the second quarter. The proceeds either have been or will be used to refinance our debt obligations. We are pleased with our current capital structure, which allows us to prioritize returns to shareholders, as illustrated by our $3 billion total returns commitment for 2024 and our $4 billion commitment for 2025. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. And ladies and gentlemen, I believe we will open the floor for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: Good morning Olivier and Stephane. Olivier, I know in your guidance for the year, you didn't used the word or highlight raise, but it seems like there was a slight EBITDA guide raise. I guess, one is, am I correct in that? And two, is the guidance for ‘25 that you'd already laid out, I guess, now starting from a bit higher base, the numbers need to kind of move up across the board?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. That's a fair assessment and a fair reading of our guidance in the prepared remarks. We have originally been guiding the EBITDA growth year-on-year in the mid-teens and we have here confirmed that, as we have delivered the second quarter and foresee further margin expansion in the second half driven by the different factor we highlighted, we still foresee the EBITDA growth year-on-year to be now in the range of 14% to 15%. Hence, I believe this is indeed a very solid outlook for EBITDA growth year-on-year and in line with our previous guidance, but certainly on the back of international margin expansion. The success we have had in the second quarter, we expect to carry on, as we continue to execute with greater revenue and favorable market position in the second half.
James West: And then maybe just a quick follow-up for me. It seems like international, we obviously know offshore looks great, but international land, particularly in the Middle East, across the Middle East, whether it's KSA or UAE, looks like expansion is going to be significantly or going to be strong. Maybe it's not much above your expectations, but very, very strong growth. Could you maybe highlight what you're seeing in the Middle East right now across the region? If there's any particular projects that make sense to highlight, I'd love to hear that.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think it's fair to say that, we see a large breadth of growth engine across the region, Middle East and also North Africa, driven by a combination of all capacity expansion program that I think you may know are still in full swing in many countries, including KSA, but most visibly the UAE, the Kuwait and Iraq are running after and Libya, are running after visible oil capacity expansion program and activity as such is indeed going up. The addition of large conventional and unconventional gas projects that are being accelerated in several countries to respond to local demand and to desire to transition. I think we are seeing it obviously in Saudi and we commented a lot on this before. You may have seen into the earnings press release that, we have been awarded an extension and the large markets for our drilling services for the unconventional program in Saudi. We continue to fully participate into the other country where this is very relevant including UAE committing to accelerate their own commercial, including Qatar that continue to expand and including Algeria that is starting to look back and clearly having a path forward to also activity increase. All across the Middle East, we see growth year-on-year. We see, as I said, the vast majority of the GeoUnit having record revenue for this cycle and for many record ever activity. Hence, we benefit from this very large growth and multiple levels of activity growth in the Middle East and we foresee it continuing going forward.
Operator: Next we go to the line of David Anderson with Barclays.
David Anderson : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. I want to talk about the key resilient markets that you mentioned a few times that are driving SLB's growth going forward. I was wondering if you could give us kind of your longer-term views on global natural gas markets, and how they're developing. And kind of maybe your demand assumptions through the end of the decade. Because I noticed that there was a number of contracts and awards that you're hiring were natural gas, so for unconventional Qatar, Egypt. So I'm just wondering, is your -- are you expecting your overall mix of business to shift towards natural gas in the coming years? Is that already happening?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. I will be -- I will say that more generically as we see resilience on 3 aspects, resilience on the steel oil capacity expansion and deepwater oil developments happening and having significant resilience. And you may foresee not an existing deepwater program in oil in the Latin Americas region, but you will see emerging new oil developments coming into Africa. So that's a strong resilient aspect of deepwater. You see and you can anticipate a gas resilience in deepwater development more in the Isthmeb, Turkey and Asia region. And then you have the complex of indeed Middle East that is both reinforcing their oil capacity, as I mentioned. And gas so it's not only one market. I think gas, we have increased our share of gas activity in Middle East visibly. We are very well exposed. I would say we are long on gas in the Middle East region. And we believe that it's a matter of offshore long cycle, both oil and gas, Middle East oil capacity and on commercial gas developments and Asia for gas security reason, offshore development for gas as well. So it's a mix that is favorable. And then we should not forget about North America that I think has continued high intensity technology deployment to support sustained production growth for oil, particularly in the short term.
David Anderson : So if I could dig in a little bit more on the offshore. You had highlighted OneSubsea's performance this quarter, with the backlog conversion. We saw a number of announcements as well during the quarter on the OneSubsea. I was wondering, could you talk a little bit about the order book, how that's shaping up this year's date compared to last year? And just kind of overall your offshore portfolio, are you expecting growth to start to accelerate in the next couple of quarters and into 2025?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we see the market of deepwater. I think you have two markets. You have the market offshore shallow that is highly concentrated in Middle East and to the States and in Asia. And then you have the deepwater market that is consolidated in Americas, Africa and some part of Asia and Isthmeb. And I think what we see, if you look at more generically, we see three legs of activity developing for the future of deepwater, large and offshore, large, but deepwater in particular. There is a strong portfolio of projects underway from Guyana to Brazil, from Norway to part of Asia that we'll continue to complete and develop to the next two or three years and are part of the portfolio of subsea deployment that we have across. Then you have an ongoing set of FID, and we expect that offshore FID this year will be reaching $100 billion exceeding this and the same for 2025. And this FID is led by a combination of oil, a lot of oil FID being developed and being nearing decision in the coming months and some have just been approved and you have seen some of the announcements in Patria and Angola. We are very pleased with this because that would feed our pipeline of subsea going forward. And lastly, we should not forget that there is a third leg. The third leg is coming from exploration and appraisal activity that is not only happening in Namibia or not only happening in Brazil or in Suriname or in Asia, but I think it's very strong across many basin in frontier region as well as in infrastructure led exploration. We believe that, this third leg will certainly add quarters, if not years of growth to the deepwater outlook. Hence, we are very confident on our exposure to the deepwater market. To the offshore market at large, as we commented before that, offshore represent about 50% of our revenue exposure internationally and we see it extremely resilient and we see multiple legs in the deepwater market going forward.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
Scott Gruber: Good morning. Wanted to ask about how you think about segmenting the portfolio next year when ChampionX comes in. I guess the heart of the question is, you have this awesome digital business, it's growing rapidly, it's going to be $3 billion or so in revenues next year. Does the ChampionX acquisition provide opportunity for you to think about re-segmenting the portfolio to further highlight the digital business?
Olivier Le Peuch: First, I cannot comment, obviously, as you understand, where we stand on the -- with regulatory process and usual process clearance on the ChampionX. But obviously, we are looking at the way we could at the time of the closing and restructure and get better exposure to the digital if we can do this in a way that will indeed expose and provide a little bit more direct measurement of our success and ambition going forward in digital. That's the integration team looking into it and we will make decision in due time and inform you.
Scott Gruber: Okay. We will wait for the details, but good to hear. And then you mentioned low single-digit revenue growth in 3Q and continued margin expansion, but it does sound like the margin expansion potential may be stronger into 4Q, with those year-end sales. Can you just provide a bit more color on how you see the margin expansion potential shaping up for 3Q? And then, if you want to, any additional color on 4Q?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. We would expect that, on the low single-digit global growth sequentially in the fourth quarter to still increase our margin expansion and not give more precise guidance. We expect an uptick in the fourth quarter, driven first by an acceleration of our top-line sequential growth in the fourth quarter, in part due to the year-end effect of product sales in both software, digital and in some of our equipment division. This will lead to acceleration also our margin expansion, giving us a very good exit point if you like, as we enter 2025, an ambition to continue growth, as I mentioned and further expand the margin. That's setting the scene very well as we conclude the year with the guidance we have shared and preparing 2025 an overview of growth and margin expansion.
Operator: Next we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram: Good morning, Olivier. You highlighted margin expansion for SLB through quality revenue growth, digital and efficiency gains. I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on just the concept of quality revenue growth, what you're referring to there and just maybe some of the plans to boost efficiency. I assume there's some cost structure alignment going on at the company, maybe you can give us some more thoughts on that?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think quality revenue growth is focusing selectively on we believe -- where we believe we have the most operational leverage, the most pressing upside and the most technology adoption potential to suit our growth with higher accretive margin and hence to support our margin ambition expansion going forward. We have demonstrated this fairly well in the second quarter. We continue to focus on this selectively. The market internationally remains tight and it favors the best performer from execution and we'll use this to deploy technology, fit-for-basin technology, use our unique integration capability and spice it up, if I may, with digital capability to increase and improve our margin going forward. So that's where we look at what we call quality revenue growth. And indeed, we have taken some measure to further support this by adjusting and relooking at our support structure and where we could and we should adjust to prepare for supporting our growth and adjusting our asset to fit where we see the most resilience going forward. So that has been also contributing and will continue to contribute to margin expansion going forward.
Arun Jayaram: That's helpful. Just a follow-up on D&I, your margins rebounded to 31%. You reiterated your high-teens growth outlook for digital. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a sense of D&I margin progression over the balance of the year and just how you're thinking about the APS business broadly in Canada in terms of SLB's broader portfolio.
Stephane Biguet: So yes, we were quite happy with the not only the top-line growth, but the margin expansion in the D&I division in the second quarter. And as I said earlier, it was all due to the digital business. So, APS was flat. And as it relates to the rest of the year, we do definitely expect the digital margins to continue improving in the second half. It will accelerate even more so in the fourth quarter on higher sales, but also on the effect of the changes we are making in the digital delivery and support organization to pull resources on a more global and regional basis to scale the business more efficiently. So as it relates to the APS business, again, it's always it is mostly flat quarter-on-quarter. So all the upside is coming from digital. And your question on Canada, I think we have signaled before that we were looking at divesting the asset and it's very much the case. We have actually reached -- we have launched a formal process again. We are quite happy with the results. So we will move to the second phase of this process, which is that we had several offers. We have shortlisted -- selected set of buyers and we are moving to negotiation with the selected set of buyers. It's so far so good. It's going well on this process and we'll update you later.
Operator: Next we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team. Olivier, I'd love your perspective on deepwater markets and offshores, particularly given some of the incremental investment in Subsea? And just how -- maybe you can characterize the different regions where deepwater is growing and what activity you're seeing and how that fits into your long-term strategy?
Olivier Le Peuch: It's a longer for better outlook first. It's a market that has multiple legs, as I said. Actually, if I start to list all the deepwater basins currently under production in future FID and future exploration, I think it would be a long list. What characterized this cycle, it is very broad in term of region of the world and deepwater basins that are being either explored and that are being redeveloped. I think there is there are two or three fundamental reasons for this. First and foremost is that, the deepwater assets from be it oil or gas typically geologically very strong asset and advantaged assets. Hence, they received utmost focus and priority when the IOCs are high grade in our portfolio. They typically concentrate on some of these assets, followed by select international independents and some NOCs for which deepwater is their backyard and their center of expertise. We see FID growth, we see exploration growth and we see existing deepwater basin very solid going forward, hence very resilient and multi finger and multi legs, I would say, outlook for deepwater. That's quite unique. It's not one basin. It's constrained by some rig capacity and it's shifting to the right to some extent, but it's longer for better. It's elongating if I would say, as a deepwater market and for the good, because it’s -- we have new basins emerging like Namibia. We have basin being FID like Suriname. We have a lot of explore activity in Asia, many parts of Asia with some gas success and discovery in Indonesia particularly. We still have the hot East Med or Turkey basin and we have new oil being explored in South Angola or in South of Brazil in the new Pelotas Basin. It's all hot and it's very diverse, and not forgetting about the deep formation into the Gulf of Mexico coming back and if not Mexico as well in the South of the Gulf. More work into the future, more bookings in the future, and I think a very key and regional market for us, as we are very exposed to that offshore deepwater.
Neil Mehta: Thank you. The follow-up is just around return of capital. Obviously, some of the dynamics around ChampionX precluded you from buying back as much stock as you probably wanted to in the last quarter, but seems like you're leaning into it. Just talk about your return of capital intentions and how you're thinking about taking advantage of any dislocation that might exist in the stock?
Stephane Biguet: Neil, we did try to take the most advantage of this by resuming very quickly our stock buybacks in June right after the shareholders vote. We were able to accelerate there and actually catch up on to the point where we go to just about half of our full year commitment. So the commitment remains the same for 2024 at this moment. It's a total of $3 billion between dividends and buybacks. We will continue to monitor our cash flow, continue to look at our capital allocation. For example, potential cash proceeds from divestitures depending on their timing can be an upside to buybacks. But for the moment, the target for ’24 remains $3 billion.
Operator: And our next question is from Dan Kutz with Morgan Stanley.
Dan Kutz: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question more generally on M&A. I'd love to get a sense of kind of your appetite as it stands today for incremental acquisitions, given that you guys have been pretty active recently? And to the extent that that's still that M&A ranks high on your capital allocation priority list, would just love if you could talk about some of the characteristics that you would look for and potential targets. It seems like, the theme of the recent acquisitions was kind of stability, longevity and growth, given that they were kind of production or new energy related. Just hoping you could kind of give us your latest thoughts on your M&A appetite.
Stephane Biguet: Thanks, Dan. So you mentioned we've been quite active indeed. So at this stage, we are really focusing on making those acquisitions and various transactions from Aker Subsea to Aker Carbon Capture to the planned acquisition of ChampionX as a success. So we are the focus currently is more on integration than on new M&A. And really in terms of prioritization in for the capital allocation at this moment, we are really prioritizing returns to shareholders.
Dan Kutz: Great. That's helpful. And then that kind of is a good lead into my next question. So on Aker Carbon Capture specifically, I mean, we can see the financials of the standalone entity. I think the revenue growth has revenue has nearly doubled the last two years. I don't think folks are doubting the top-line growth story or growth potential for that business. But can you just talk about some opportunities to kind of drive margin improvement, given following the transaction and given the resources of SLB combined with Aker Carbon Capture?
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Dan. So first, I would comment maybe stepping up on the CCS as a market. I think we see this as a very attractive market for us considering the adjacency on the sequestration and considering the integration capability we have acquired and the technology we have acquired through Aker Carbon Capture. So the market independently and at this point, we see this market growing at more than 50% a year. And I'm very accretive to our growth. And we don't see this slowing down necessarily soon. And obviously, the addition of Aker Carbon Capture give us an opportunity to participate at scaling market where Aker Carbon Capture was not exposed to, partly in North America, where we're getting a lot of inbound requests as we form this combination, unique combination with what we have invested into our own capture technology with carbon capture commercial technology, we are seeing a lot of inbound requests and we have been awarded and part of two DOE-funded projects in North America and another shipping ban request from a company that are exploring and/or pursuing some carbon capture in North America. We see the same in Middle East. This will complement the strong pipeline that Aker Carbon Capture has already developed in Europe with three active projects and most likely more to come. We see that, we will combine our strengths in technology deployment at scale in every basin in the world, combining this with the subsurface sequestration technology leadership we have to offer customers an all in capability from sequestration design execution to carbon capture, combining our technology with the technology of our carbon capture. We are very positive on this and we believe that, as this business will scale, as we will be in a position to add on many new innovation technology on it, this will result into margin expansion and into ability to extract a lot of value from this acquisition.
Operator: Next, we go to Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.
Luke Lemoine: Hi. Good morning. Arun touched on it a little earlier with his question, but you mentioned cost efficiency programs a couple of times in the release. It sounded like maybe these were primarily support costs. First, is that correct? Secondly, would it be possible to maybe frame the magnitude of these?
Stephane Biguet: Thanks for the question, Luke. Really this program is about extracting the most margin expansion and returns out of this growth cycle. It's not just support, even though it's one of the key element of it. You have three main components. First, there's a more tactical adjustment, if you want, of our operational resources in mostly in U.S. land to account basically for the lower-than-expected rig count levels. The second one relates to digital. We are centralizing or regionalizing a certain number of delivery services to improve resource utilization, so that we can better respond to the rapid adoption of our digital solutions. Indeed the third one, not a small component, about half of it if you want, is increasing efficiency in our functional superstructure. It's something we do all the time. But here, we are completing the deployment of our new ERP system. We really want to extract the most out of this and it allows us to streamline some of the superstructure. In terms of magnitude, you've seen the charge this quarter. It's slightly over $100 million pretax. I don't expect that, this will exceed this amount in the third quarter. We are still in the process of finalizing all the plans. I cannot give you a number on that, but it should not be of a bigger magnitude. Then this will result in great savings and optimization of our cost lines, which you will see gradually towards the end of the year and of course in 2025.
Operator: Next we go to Saurabh Pant with Bank of America.
Saurabh Pant: Hi, good morning, Olivier and Stephane. I guess, I just want to go back to the OneSubsea joint venture, especially on the all-electric, the groundbreaking award you announced with Norway. That's a big deal, I think, from both a technical and a commercial opportunity standpoint. Olivier, if you don't mind spending a little time on that, how should we think about that opportunity unfolding? What are the constraint, especially on the regulatory side of that? Just talk to the opportunity on just that all electric subsea side of things.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. This is a great question, Saurabh. We are very excited. We are very excited because we believe this is one of the leg of technology deployment that could change the game in the long-term and in the subsea infrastructure deployment. First, because it allows a lower footprint, a smaller footprint, reducing and eliminating hydraulics into the subsea and eliminate -- ultimately eliminating cost. And secondly, allowing full digital control of the subsea infrastructure. And last, obviously, having an impact onto the carbon footprint of this infrastructure. So we believe that for recovery, cost and low carbon, we believe that there is a future for our deepwater all-electric bid on the subsurface. And as you have seen, we you might have seen that we have announced earlier in the year and last year that we have made progress and being awarded several contracts on a completion subsurface all-electric solution. I will continue to lead in this domain and combine it with all-electric subsidiary or subsea infrastructure that then when combined together with the subsurface give us an opportunity to fully digitize and fully control and provide our customers and the operators the ability to optimize recovery and control and optimize the maintenance as well in this field. So that's part of the future of deepwater is electric and we're very pleased to have been awarded this as a result of our consortium actually, [Indiscernible] for other operators. So this will take place in several basins we believe, in particular in Brazil and another place and we'll be ready to deploy this for our customers.
Saurabh Pant: Okay. That's fantastic color, Olivier. Maybe I have a quick unrelated follow-up on the D&I side of things. I think in the press release, you mentioned in a couple of places about just the second quarter being held by exploration data license sales. I know these tend to be lumpy, but is there anything to read into this on what's happening on the exploration side of things? It does sound there are more exploration around across the globe, but is it just lumpiness in the second quarter? Or is there anything we can read into on just where exploration is going?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. I think the trend has been up, and I think it has been contributing in line with our ambition for digital growth as the data exploration sales has been a success. And we foresee this to continue to grow going forward in the quarters to come. Sometime, it will be up and sometime it will be slightly down, but we foresee a growth and I think this is driven by the frontier exploration. This is driven by infrastructure led exploration in natural basins and this is driven by new generation of software digital application that can relook an existing basin and extract more value for understanding and finding new hydrocarbon and or new gas finds into the existing basins. So, we're very pleased to have a leading offering both in term of digital capability to repossess existing data sets and also to be able to enhance the vintage data sets and to be having this in the right basin and the right place and parts linked too many of these licensing rounds. You're right to say that, many licensing round expected this year, no less than actually 70 licensing rounds are being announced across many parts of the world and I think some of them have been highly successful. Deepwater has been a success for critical finds and critical hydrocarbon, both oil and gas in the last few quarters and we expect this to continue. There's increased interest into the Apollo pass, which is the last hot spot South of Brazil. You have the Namibe Basin south of Angola, North of Namibia. You have Indonesia, India. You have Bangladesh, you have many, many spots that are being discovered and being explored with fresh data sets and the opportunity to indeed boost and support our participation to this market going forward. I think we will continue to participate and maximize this, and this will be, on occasion, lumpy, but we believe this will continue to grow.
Saurabh Pant: Perfect. No, that's a very thorough answer, Olivier. I know you have made this business as an asset-light, so it's accretive to your returns to your margins. That's all very good to hear. Thank you. Olivier. I'll turn it back.
Operator: Next, we go to Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you. I didn't catch if you said, but could you update us on your outlook for international and North America revenue growth in 2024?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we have been guiding earlier this year. We remain fit on this guidance that, internationally, we foresee double-digit growth when excluding Aker and Russia. North America, we have been guiding originally positive up to mid-single growth and we have been realizing this down as the North America has been clearly impacted going forward. But, we still have opportunity to grow in the second half and to improve our margin as well in this basin as we adjust our resource and get the most out of deepwater market in Gulf of Mexico as well as our participation with technology intensity in some part of the North American land market. No change international and lower growth in North America, compared to original guidance.
Marc Bianchi: Yes. Makes sense. Maybe for Stephane, back on the cost savings, you mentioned that another charge in 3Q not to exceed what we saw in second quarter for the actions you're taking. Can you help us with how much of a profit uplift or cost saving benefit you may get on a quarterly basis in the back half of the year and then once everything finally reaches its full implementation?
Stephane Biguet: Yes. Sure. As I said, we will really complete everything. All the actions will be taken by the end of the year. But you will see gradually the effect on our margins in the second half. By the way, this is of course why we are confident in the updated, more precise guidance we gave for the full year EBITDA. We will update you more precisely on the savings once we are done at the end of Q3. In general, as a rough rule of thumb, if you want, you can assume that, the payback on these actions is between 9 to 12 months.
Operator: Our final question comes from Kurt Hallead with Benchmark.
Kurt Hallead: Thanks for fitting me in here. Appreciate the insights as always. Olivier, I think from my standpoint, Olivier, I'm kind of curious, right? We've now had five or six months or so to kind of digest the shift in game plan by Saudi Arabia from offshore to ton of conventional gas. You kind of, referenced that very explicitly in your commentary about unconventional gas being a growth market for you. But I guess from where I sit, right, we're five or six months into this process. What have you picked up incrementally with respect to that opportunity? And more importantly, what kind of legs do you see for that dynamic for you in Saudi in particular?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think you may have been reading and don't want to speak on behalf of Saudi Aramco, but I think their commitment to their program to increase gas production by 60% from 2020 is very clear. I think this touched both the conventional and unconventional gas reserve in Saudi. The most visible element of this is obviously the unconventional gas large Jafurah project. You may have seen they've also explored successfully new finds, both oil and gas, in the recent months. So, the country is set to expand in gas to complement their oil capacity, sustained capacity and slight expansion. And we are -- as I said, favorably exposed, and we have reinforced this exposure, strengthened this exposure with our recent wins, as you may have seen in the earnings press release from this morning. So, we're very pleased. But the market is not only one project. The market is not only one aspect. The market is much more diversified in Saudi and furthermore in Middle East. So, we are exposed to many aspects of the Saudi activity, both production and recovery, exploration, CCS, as well as, well construction and production equipment, both offshore and onshore. So we are very -- we have a very diversified exposure to this, and we benefit favorably to the exposure of the growth accelerated growth in Jafurah. So, we're very pleased to where we are. And we are one of the most beneficiary of the accelerated gas expansion as highlighted in our EPR highlights. So that's where we stand.
Kurt Hallead: Great. That's great color. Always appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And I'll now be turning the call back to Olivier for closing remarks.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you. Thank you, Leah. So ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the growth momentum continues with many of our international [GeoUnits] reaching new cycle highs. Combined with the increased adoption of digital technologies, the stage is set for further growth and margin expansion throughout the rest of 2024 and into 2025. Second, in this environment, no company is better positioned than SLB to capture quality growth. Our differentiated operating footprint, leading technical and digital offerings and sustained commitment to operating efficiency and value creation have set us apart throughout the cycle. Moving ahead, we remain favorably positioned in the highest quality area of the market, supported by our differentiated technology deployment, integration capabilities and performance. And third, with a strong first half of the year behind us and full confidence in further international revenue growth, we are optimally positioned to continue our margin expansion journey to generate cash and to fulfill our commitment to return to shareholders both in 2024 and in 2025. This is an excellent environment for our business, and I'm confident that we will continue to deliver outstanding performance for our customers and our shareholders in the quarters ahead. With that, I will conclude this morning's call. Thank you very much for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-19 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for standing by. Welcome to the SLB First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James R. McDonald, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Industry Affairs. Please go ahead.
James McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Kuala Lumpur, following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings which can be found on our website. We are under no obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. And finally, SLB and ChampionX will file materials related to the proposed transaction with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including a registration statement that will contain a proxy statement/prospectus of the parties. Investors and security holders are urged to read those materials once they are available, which can be obtained from the SEC's website and from the companies’ websites. SLB, ChampionX, their directors, executive officers, and certain members of management and their employees may be considered participants in the solicitation of proxies from their shareholders in connection with the proposed transaction. This will be described further in the proxy statement/prospectus perspective when it is filed. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. During my prepared remarks, I will discuss three topics. I will begin by sharing an overview of our first quarter results; then, I will provide an update on the ongoing market dynamics and highlight areas where we anticipate opportunities for further growth; and finally, I will conclude with our outlook for the full year and the second quarter. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. I'm very pleased with our strong start to 2024. Year-on-year, revenue grew 13% and EBITDA grew in the mid-teens, in line with our full year financial ambitions. Additionally, we demonstrated the differentiated value we deliver to our customers, the impact of our continued capital discipline, and execution efficiency, by expanding year-on-year adjusted EBITDA margins for the 13th consecutive quarter. Internationally, we harnessed broad-based activity growth, with 21 of our 25 international GeoUnits increasing revenue year-on-year. Even when excluding the Aker contribution, our international revenue grew by double-digits. These impressive results were led by the Middle East & Asia, which exhibited remarkable growth of 29% compared to the same period a year ago. Specifically in the Middle East and North Africa, year-on-year growth was supported by continued investments in long-cycle developments and capacity expansion projects, in both oil and gas, across Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. And in Asia, we saw strong activity across the region led by offshore, notably in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and India. Meanwhile, in North America, activity remains soft due to weaker gas prices, sustained capital discipline, and the effects of ongoing market consolidation. The slower activity contributed to revenue in the region declining by 6% year-on-year. Next, I will comment on the Divisions’ performance. I was very proud to see the power of the core divisions continue to drive our performance this quarter. In particular, you may have seen the remarkable growth in Production Systems, supported by our OneSubsea joint venture, and in Reservoir Performance, led by increased stimulation, evaluation, and intervention services. Well Construction also delivered resilient growth. I was also pleased to see our core margins visibly expand year-on-year, and I trust that this will continue as we remain focused on efficiency and value creation for our customers. Turning to Digital & Integration. I continue to follow our performance very closely. Although we experienced the typical pattern of seasonally slower sales to start the year, digital still grew in the double-digits year-on-year during the first quarter and we expect a visible uptick of digital sales throughout the rest of the year. This will be supported by increased customer adoption and a baseload of ongoing projects, as you can see from the quarterly highlights included in our press release this morning. For the full year, we maintain our ambition to grow our digital revenue in the high-teens. Overall, I am very pleased with this strong start to 2024. We will remain focused on the quality of our revenue, capital discipline, and execution efficiency to generate strong cash flows and shareholder returns throughout the year. I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering this first quarter performance. They continue to operate at a benchmark level for the industry, and I feel privileged to work with such a dedicated and talented team. Next, let me shift into the ongoing market dynamics and how these are creating opportunities for our business. We are in the midst of a unique oil and gas cycle, characterized by strong market fundamentals, growing demand, and an even deeper focus on energy security. As described on several occasions, this cycle continue to display breadth, resilience, and longevity, this is very much the case in the Asia region where we are hosting this call today. In this context, there are certain priorities that are increasingly critical to our customers: project life-cycle reduction, particularly in exploration & appraisal to accelerate time to first gas or first oil; capital efficiency in the development phase to set new benchmarks in every basin; step change in production and recovery for producing assets and for unconventional resources; and finally, adoption of Digital & Al capabilities to transform operations and use of technology to abate emissions. Against this backdrop, we continue to innovate with our customers, through the combination of integration, fit-for-basin technologies, and digital, focusing on unlocking value by delivering lower-cost and lower-carbon barrels. In our Core oil and gas business, we are benefiting from these trends with our exposure to the fastest growing and most resilient markets. This cycle continues to be defined by broad growth across the international basins, and there is nowhere this is more evident than in the Middle East and global offshore markets. In the Middle East, countries are investing to increase both oil and gas supplies through the end of the decade. The long-cycle nature of the investments provides further confidence in the durability of the cycle, and we look forward to continue working with our customers to deliver on these targets. And offshore, many of the FIDs from the past few years have commenced, leading to broad-based activity across Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. SLB has a strong foothold in each of these offshore regions, benefiting from our deep customer relationships, operational performance, and fit-for-basin solutions. Through our OneSubsea joint venture, we offer an unmatched pore-to-process offering throughout the full lifecycle of offshore assets, and we continue to deliver on our substantial offshore backlog. Now, looking at the priorities for producing assets today and tomorrow, we recognize the need to increase our exposure to the Production and Recovery market, including the more resilient OpEx spend, as operators work to offset natural decline, extend performance, and maximize the value of their assets. Our acquisition of ChampionX will further evolve our portfolio to capture this opportunity with the addition of a leading production chemicals business and well-established artificial lift (ph) portfolio with significant benefits to our customers in every producing basin in the world. This will be particularly visible in the offshore environment, which requires a higher intensity of production chemicals for flow assurance, reinforcing the long-cycle value of our offshore strategy. Another notable trend in the market is the enhanced focus on emissions reduction and low-carbon energy. Our early investments in this space are beginning to deliver promising results, both in the Core through our Transition Technologies, and in our New Energy portfolio, notably in Carbon Capture and Sequestration. CCS is one of the fastest-growing and most-immediate opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, and we are leveraging our domain expertise and deep knowledge of the subsurface to respond to an increased demand in our storage solutions. At the same time, we are also expanding to address opportunities throughout the CCS value chain. As you saw in our announcement a few weeks ago, we have entered into an agreement to combine our carbon capture business with Aker Carbon Capture and will own 80% of the combined entity. This is an exciting opportunity to bring together our complementary technology portfolios, leading process design expertise, and an established project delivery platform to innovate and deliver carbon capture technology solutions at an industrial scale. Looking across our broad portfolio, it is clear that our three engines of growth, each with differentiated technologies and exciting project pipelines, are positioning us for continued performance across all time horizons. Supported by our strong international portfolio and our unique technology driven approach to North America, we are truly making this investment cycle better for longer. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook for the full year and the second quarter. Based on the commentary I have just shared, the ongoing characteristics of the cycle, and our strong first quarter results, we remain confident in our full year financial guidance, with strength in international activity offsetting slower growth in North America. In particular, we anticipate the activity momentum in the international markets to continue, driven by increasing global demand and an even deeper focus on energy security. The relevance of oil and gas in the energy mix continues to support further investments in capacity expansion, particularly in the Middle East and in long-cycle projects across the global offshore markets, fully aligned with our international revenue ambitions. Additionally, we expect to realize further growth in the strengthening production and recovery market as operators work to maximize the efficiency and longevity of their producing assets. Altogether, this continues to present a very strong outlook for our business during 2024 and beyond. Specific to the second quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth internationally in the mid-single digits and North America in the low-single digits. We also expect to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by 75 bps to100 bps. By Division, we expect sequential growth to be led by Digital & Integration, followed by Reservoir Performance, Production Systems, and Well Construction, all of which are rebounding from the conclusion of winter seasonality. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier. Good morning, ladies, and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.75. This represents an increase of $0.12 when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the first quarter, we recorded $0.01 of merger and integration charges associated with our 2023 acquisition of the Aker subsea business. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $8.7 billion increased 12.6% year-on-year. Excluding the impact of the Aker subsea acquisition, revenue increased 6.5% when compared to the same quarter last year. International revenue was up 18% year-on-year, and more than 10% when excluding the contribution from Aker, driven in particular by year-on-year growth of 29% in the Middle East & Asia. North America revenue decreased 6% year-on-year, primarily due to lower rig count in U.S. land and the effect of lower gas pricing which impacted our APS project in Canada. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 23.6%, up 51 basis points year-on-year. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 15% year-on-year. This is in line with our guidance for adjusted EBITDA to grow in the mid-teens for the full year of 2024. Our pre-tax segment operating margin increased 95 basis points driven by strong incremental margins internationally. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $953 million increased 7% year-on-year as Digital revenue experienced double-digit growth while APS revenue was flat. Margins declined 300 basis points year-on-year to 26.6% due to the effects of higher APS amortization expense and lower commodity prices on our APS project in Canada. Margins for the Digital & Integration Division are expected to improve in Q2 and throughout the rest of the year, as digital sales will increase sequentially, in line with the usual seasonal trend. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.7 billion increased 15% year-on-year due to strong stimulation activity, particularly in Middle East & Asia and offshore. Margins expanded 356 basis points as compared to the first quarter of last year to 19.7% driven by higher activity and improved pricing. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 3% year-on-year as International growth of 9% was largely offset by lower revenue in North America. Margins of 20.5% were essentially flat year-on-year. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.8 billion increased 28% year-on-year. Excluding the effects of the acquired Aker subsea business, Production Systems revenue grew 6% driven by strong international sales. Margins of 14.2% expanded 490 basis points year-on-year driven by a favorable activity mix, strong execution, and pricing improvements. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $327 million of cash flow from operations. Free cash flow of negative $222 million was slightly better than the same period last year. These cash flows reflect the seasonal effects of the payout of our annual employee incentives and lower cash collections following very strong receivable performance in the fourth quarter of last year. Consistent with our historical trend, free cash flow is expected to be higher in the second quarter and to continue to increase in the third and fourth quarters. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $549 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares for a total purchase price of $270 million. As we disclosed a couple of weeks ago, we have raised our 2024 target for total returns of capital to shareholders from $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This $3 billion will be evenly split between dividends and share repurchases. Lastly, we plan on filing our S-4 registration statement relating to the ChampionX acquisition in the next couple of weeks. The transaction will require the approval of ChampionX shareholders. During the period after ChampionX mails its proxy for the merger until its shareholder vote, we are required to suspend our share buyback program. While this will not impact our total share repurchases for the year of approximately $1.5 billion, it will potentially result in our buybacks being more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe, we are opening the floor for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey. Good morning, Olivier and Stephane.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning
Stephane Biguet: Good morning.
James West: So Olivier, I know you alluded to it earlier, and you and I have had conversations about the cycle recently as well. But how are you thinking about in the last six, eight weeks or so as we've seen just increased amounts of contracts and rig awards, and subsea equipment awards. How are you thinking about where we are in this cycle today and the duration of the cycle? Because it seems to me, we're -- right now, it's a Middle East, Asia and offshore story, but certainly going to broaden out to more regions as well. So I'm curious to kind of get your big picture high-level thoughts.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. So from our perspective, I think, first and foremost, I think the cycle attributes that we have described earlier, the breadth, the resilience, the durability or the longevity of the cycle are fully in place and are driven by a combination of strong fundamental energy demand, oil and gas demand, if anything is trending upwards from the revision. Energy security is still on top of the agenda. There is no other place than Asia to realize this on the ground. And as such, I think the base of (ph) activity is being supported by very critical flow of investment, both as you said, in capacity expansion, which is already committed. But also, I think in short-cycle and long-cycle offshore, deepwater and shallow. And I think I was here in Asia, and it was remarkable to see the breadth, the diversity of the opportunity, the number of countries, offshore, onshore, the new exploration appraisal cycle, the new entrants that are coming in Southeast Asia, they were not before to invest because they are looking for securing gas supply, and they are looking to participate to maintain oil production. So I believe that if you combine this with what is happening in North America, which is North America operating within a threshold and not necessarily with significant anticipation of supply growth in that market in short term. This is only accentuating the characteristics of the cycle in international. And it can -- if I can reflect from the last two or three months of a lot of customer engagements, the sentiment is trending more positively than it was maybe six or 12 months ago. Hence, customer engaging to secure capacity on long projects such as deepwater and subsea, and they are looking for partnership collaboration to make sure that we help them into securing the best capital efficiency, as I highlighted, look for integration to accelerate the product cycle to get faster to first oil, first gas. So if anything, I think I see more, stronger pipeline of projects that will help us -- help this cycle to prolong beyond what we could have anticipated a year ago.
James West: Right. Got it. Okay. Makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the digital side and the rollout of the Delfi platform. How do you feel about the progress that's happening there, the adoption by customers? I know you've got a good number of customers so far, but still the penetration is probably not nearly where it will be in three to five years, but it's a powerful tool and so how do you see adoption trending from here?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think the adoption continues to trend favorably. I think you'll continue to see as we deliver quarter-after-quarter both sorts of announcements in digital operation in cloud adoption for geoscience workflow or in data and AI, as you have seen the diversity of what we announced this quarter. I do expect the same next quarter and the following quarter because we believe that customers are realizing that they need to unlock efficiency and they need to accelerate the cycle, and they need to extract lower carbon solutions for their assets. So this is pulling. So we are still -- and we have renewed our ambition and targets to reach or exceed high teens for digital growth this year. And we started the year, I would say, considering the seasonal low - in the teens -- low teens growth year-on-year, double-digits, that was fully aligned with what we could have anticipated and it will continue. So I see quarter-after-quarter expansion of digital adoption. And I see more and more contribution from digital operations, be it drilling automation with production operation solutions, and you will see that in the coming quarter and the upcoming transaction with ChampionX will only strengthen this production operation offering as it will complement and give us another platform to expand our digital adoption. So I remain very constructive, and I believe that it is a long trend of digital adoption that will continue throughout the rest of the decade.
James West: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James.
Operator: Next, we move on to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Thank you. Good morning, Olivier and Stephane.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, David.
Stephane Biguet: Good morning.
David Anderson: So just a question on kind of the timing of the ChampionX deal and sort of, as it relates to where we are in the cycle. So these are all product lines that are targeting the production side of the well life cycle, primary drivers can be OpEx spending, particularly with deepwater development ramping up in the coming years. Conversely, the timing of acquiring a later cycle company might suggest that you're positioned for upstream spending to be structurally slow in the coming years. So could you just help us understand a little bit the dynamics as sort of the OpEx cycle and the CapEx cycle? I totally appreciate the duration of it, but I guess I'm sort of thinking about the sort of the cadence of the different cycles. Can you just help us understand kind of how the timing of that works out and maybe you just see the OpEx cycle expanding higher, but the two dynamics, I think, are causing a little bit of questioning in the market, I guess, today.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. No, it's a fair question. And I think first and foremost, stepping back in time. I think we have been -- as we prepared our core strategy a few years back, we identified that production recovery in particular production chemicals, reservoir chemicals, and lift solutions will be a domain where we need to invest in technology, and we need to explore opportunity to accelerate our market participation because we believe two things: we believe first, that this market will benefit from further innovation, from further integration, from further disruption, and hence create through OpEx, the efficiency gains into production operations, into recovery. And we believe that the market is discovering to some extent has discovered, but has an opportunity to exploit more of these production chemicals, more of this optimized full life lift solution and combined with digital, so we believe that all in all, this market is not only an OpEx versus CapEx. This market is responding to increased demand, and increased opportunity we see in the market that has been there growing, and for which we are willing to respond and the customer feedback and engagement we had realizing the potential of what we can put together from technology from workflow integration, from automation and from optimization from the main reservoir knowledge to process equipment will clearly create a new leg into the technology deployment and into the efficiency of producing assets. So -- and I will not try to oppose OpEx/CapEx. I will just say that the production recovery is becoming critical- it has been for the last few quarters - has increasingly become part of the priority of our customers. Now we believe as well that this market has further resilience because the market, every liquid produced in the world, more or less demands an amount of production chemicals to assure its resilience in production. And at the same time, we believe that as the long term, most of the assets will see a higher water cuts, and some of the assets will see more complex reservoir fluids coming up to the process facility. There will be an increasing need to add in more sophisticated and more technical production chemicals to the flow. So all in all, an opportunity today and a resilient outlook for tomorrow.
David Anderson: So it's not so much, you see, I've seen CapEx slowing. It is more that you see OpEx side increasing and more technology increasing. That sounds...
Olivier Le Peuch: Exactly. I see what we see and in the engagement with customers, we see that in their quest for production recovery opportunity, we see that a combination of production chemicals, digital capability including optimizing some production lift solutions and overall intervention is in dire need for modernizing, innovation, and automation. And we believe that the addition of this to our portfolio, the significant talent and capability we are getting through the addition of ChampionX will help us fast-track this new path of production recovery market expansion. That would be a combination of OpEx and CapEx, and OpEx will only supplement and add opportunity for growth and it is not at all relating to where we are in the cycle for CapEx.
David Anderson: Understood. And then so just as a follow-up on the ChampionX deal. I was surprised to see you announced $400 million in synergies for a company that was as well run as ChampionX is. Can you help us break that down a little bit more? Like, where do you see the greatest opportunity on the cost side? And also, if you could expand the revenue synergy side. To be honest, we hear about revenue synergies all the time but ultimately don't materialize. So what's different here in ChampionX, where you have more confidence in the revenue synergy side?
Stephane Biguet: So Dave, yes, thanks for the question. So again, yes, $400 million of annual synergies which we think we can achieve in the first three years. And as we said, 70% to 80% achieved in the second year, which makes the transaction accretive to earnings per share in year two. So now we have the full integration team in place, refining estimates going through all the buckets of synergies. So I’m not going to give you definitive numbers, but as a rough split, most of the synergies, most of the $400 million synergies, let’s say, about 75% of it is related to costs and 25% related to initial revenue synergies, so of the 75% cost synergies, again, an approximate 75%, you can say that roughly half of that is on our own SLB spend. We mentioned earlier, we spent a lot of chemicals, for example, for overall operations. And with the manufacturing and internalization of spend we can do with ChampionX, we think we can have great savings there. And the over half or so of the cost synergies would be G&A and other operating cost savings if that helps.
David Anderson: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Dave.
Operator: Next, we move on to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Good morning. Olivier, I wanted to get your perspective on the spending picture in Saudi Arabia and the potential impacts from SLB given the decision to maintain their maximum spare capacity at 12 million barrels, but obviously, a shift to higher levels of gas development. And I just wondered also if you could maybe address just the recent decision to suspend some shallow water drilling in the country.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. Thank you, Arun. I think let me first maybe for simplicity and for aligning our views, maybe let me unpack first and give some additional color on this rig suspension. And I think these are public data, and I think a total of 20 to 22 rigs are being suspended to divest for consolidation. But this is in the context of this both Safaniya and Manifa projects, oil incremental project expansion program, that has been suspended. Both of these assets were having combined slightly above 20 jackups operating in these two assets at the end of last year. The anticipation of the additional rigs necessary for the expansion, we expect customers will add (corrected by company after the call) another dozen rigs. When you make the math at the end of this year, both of these assets will host slightly above 10 to a dozen rigs or a net 10 rigs less than the rig count at the (corrected by company after the call) end of last year. So that's first, what is happening on offshore. You contrast this with the gas market and a decision that was almost coincidental with the MSC decision, to increase the gas capacity towards 2030 by 60% compared to 2021. This is actually resulting in the total rig activity increase and net rig addition between now and the end of the year 2025 (added by company after the call) of a total approximately 35-40 (corrected by company after the call) rigs across the entire unconventional and conventional, both workover rigs, coiled tubing drilling units, and drilling rigs for the unconventional Jafurah and for the conventional gas. So this switch from offshore to onshore, the switch from oil to gas is actually the execution of strategy of Saudi Aramco, I believe. And it happened that we have market exposure that is long on land, very long on land and it's balanced and actually long on gas. So as a consequence for us, while this is an activity that has changed and a mix that wasn't anticipated six months ago, this will not have a natural impact on our ambition for growth for Saudi, this will not change our guidance for Middle East sustained growth. And this will continue to support our ambition to grow international and hence, the full guidance directed this morning.
Arun Jayaram: Great. That's helpful. And just my follow-up, Olivier, could you just characterize the rest of the spending picture in the GCC and the Middle East outside of Saudi?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think that's a very good point. Actually, it's very broad growth and activity uptick in almost all the country with possible exception of Egypt these days, considering the cash and the valuation situation. But almost every other country is having a very significant growth and I have been citing a few countries this morning, and I could not stop listing all of them. And it includes Qatar that is starting to now remobilize for addition of the West North field. Obviously, Kuwait, as we commented earlier that is coming now very well structured to execute their capacity expansion, UAE on both gas and oil. Oman is very steady. Iraq, as you have seen, we have had some nice contracts also in that region. So we are very comfortable about the breadth, the diversity of the activity growth, rig activity growth, in the region. And actually, a couple of rigs or more could actually be redirected from the offshore Saudi contract to supplement and to help accelerate some activity in the region, while some others are already being retained to some extent for future activity here in the Southeast Asia. So I believe that the Middle East, as we said earlier, last year broke and had a total market spend that was record high. I think this record is just extending this year and with a very good breadth of oil and gas onshore and offshore activity despite a slight change of mix in Saudi.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we move on to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Yeah. Thank you for all the strategic comments. I had a couple of more financial questions. The first, just the second quarter commentary, if I look at Q1 EPS was $0.75, and I think The Street's got moving to $0.84 in the second quarter. So just would love your perspective on how we should think about the 2Q versus 1Q build as you have pretty good visibility at this point into the second quarter?
Stephane Biguet: So Neil, as we have mentioned Q2, we always see the reversal of seasonality, if you want, and very strong margin expansion. So we just guided to 75 to 100 basis points of incremental EBITDA margin in terms of basis points. And the rest is below the EBITDA, you can very well assume to go down to EPS, but non-operating expenses and just about all the rest is about the same as in the first quarter, if that helps.
Neil Mehta: That helps, falls in pretty well with The Street. I guess the follow-up is just on EBITDA margins. It did come in a little bit softer than maybe where The Street was on digital and integration, to a smaller extent, on Well Construction. Just love your perspective as we work our way through the year, how we should be thinking about EBITDA margins and your conviction on the recovery there? Thank you.
Stephane Biguet: So as Olivier mentioned, it has been 13 consecutive quarters that we increased EBITDA margin year-on-year. So it was the case in the first quarter as well, and it will be the case in each and every single of the remaining quarters of the year. So this year-on-year growth of EBITDA and EBITDA expansion is with us for the year. Now you mentioned the D&I margins. As you know, we are typically the lowest in the first quarter of the year, this is mostly the seasonally lower digital sales. This year, it was made worse by a lower APS revenue due to two kind of related effects, actually. The lower gas pricing in our Palliser, Canada assets and higher amortization expense per unit of production. So this resulted in a year-on-year drop in the total digital and integration margin, but this is entirely due to APS, the digital margins are intact. And as the rest of the year unfolds, as Olivier mentioned, digital sales will increase quarter-after-quarter and this will be at high incremental margins for digital considering that most of the costs are fixed. So we clearly continue to shoot for overall D&I margins above 30% on a full year basis.
Neil Mehta: Thank you so much.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Neil.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Hello. I wanted to just circle back on the Saudi comments because a few investors have asked for some clarification. Olivier, did you mention that the rig growth was the net 60, 60, even with the losses of 20 jackups?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think that I'm contrasting, I think, some offset cases, so there will be increase. There was a plan that has not changed for Saudi to accelerate the gas expansion program, what has accelerated, what has improved, is the pace of this expansion program, driven by the raise of 50% to 60% target by 2030. And as a consequence of that, the whole year that was based on previous plans that now boosted by this accelerated expansion program will result into total rigs year-on-year that will, from beginning of the year to the end, add 35-40 (corrected by company after the call) rigs in total to the gas market, all onshore. So that's the reality of the market. Some of it in unconventional, up to 10 to 15 rigs in unconventional, some of it in the gas conventional, some of it in intervention and workover, so that's a total activity that gas is a strong market for Saudi, is becoming a significant market going forward. So that's where we expect activity to continue to grow going forward. And we are essentially favorably exposed to this activity set as we have an exposure that goes above, we are long on gas as we explained. And hence, we benefit from technology that we have deployed in Saudi that is fit for the Jafurah project, technology such as coiled tubing, underbalanced coiled tubing drilling solution, that is being used on Gabon gas and the technology that we use across for conventional gas is either integrated or discrete contracts. So that's the benefit we see, and that's the total rig that we see going forward.
Scott Gruber: Thanks. It's encouraging, thanks for clarifying that. And then turning back to well construction margins. Should we be expecting those to come in about flat for the year. I know they'll improve seasonally and are always strong in the second half. Should we be thinking about kind of flat year-on-year and just thinking about the mix in that business, historically, with greater offshore activity and weaker U.S. onshore activity, I would just expect those margins to be grinding higher. So maybe if you could comment on what's kind of keeping those flat year-on-year? Maybe the mix just isn't that impactful any more with the new sales strategy in the U.S., but just some color on the year-over-year margins in Well Construction would be great.
Stephane Biguet: So look, we were flat indeed in Q1 year-on-year. But for the full year, you should actually see margin expansion in Well Construction, what the headwind we have a bit is the lower activity in North America, so that kind of masks the margin expansion internationally, but as we go through the year, you will see year-on-year growth in Well Construction. You have timing of certain stuff and adjustments on a quarterly basis. But on a year-on-year basis, you will clearly see margin expansion coming from international.
Olivier Le Peuch: Maybe for clarity of the split on the net addition in the gas market in Saudi. The net addition due to the expansion acceleration is about 20 rigs.
Scott Gruber: Okay. Great. Thanks. [Multiple Speakers]
Olivier Le Peuch: A bit more than half of that in a little bit more than half of that in unconventional and the rest in the conventional. So that’s the resulting effect of this acceleration of gas expansion into Saudi. Hence, the shift indeed from offshore to onshore and from oil to gas characterized by this accelerated expansion translating to 20 rigs and the reduction of the net offshore from end of year last year to the end of the year this year that is above 10%, plus the mix changing for clients.
Scott Gruber: Okay. Got it. I appreciate that. Thank you.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey. Hey, everybody. Thank you for sliding me in here. I appreciate that. So given the fact that you are currently in Kuala Lumpur and Asia seems to be one of your growth vehicles and something that really hasn't gotten a lot of airtime. Just kind of curious as to what you see is driving that growth and what regions within Asia you is standing out to you?
Olivier Le Peuch: Great question. I think, indeed, we had a reason to come here. And the reason why, first, the team has delivered and have been delivering a resilient growth and resilient margin expansion over the last two years since the rebound from the COVID time. And I think we have been observing, supporting the team, but I think spending two weeks in a region, I think, is clearly giving us a little bit more spotlight on to the strength of the region. I think, first and foremost, I have to say, this region is characterized by the critical resources they are putting to support security of supply, particularly gas, and investment they are going to, I would say, to support and stabilize oil production and prevent further decline. So stabilizing oil production and accelerating gas is certainly the feeling that has come on to the entire region. And I think it's further accentuated by energy security and is translating into a new wave of investments. It was very telling to see that in Indonesia, in Malaysia, in South -- in offshore China, in Bangladesh, in India. We are seeing new round of exploration appraisal that have not been seen with new entrants into this market that were not there, certainly a few years back. And I think this is creating a new set of opportunity, both offshore primarily and some of them in deepwater assets, and I think that will create further opportunity for Subsea. And at the same time, as I said, and I stress, there is also a focus independently onto supporting and preventing production decline for oil. And this is visible across all assets, both onshore and offshore, and hence, intervention recovery technology is being pulled to add investment. So you combine this wave of new investment for accelerating gas from exploration to development projects with this intervention recovery-focused production on the existing declining assets that exist here in all markets across the region, and we get the recipe for a significant investment and a steady investment in every country from Indonesia to Malaysia, to Thailand, China offshore and onshore, India, Bangladesh, as I said, a new country. And I think this is very interesting and very exciting for the team, and we are responding to this by deploying assets to bring the resources and creating fit technology for the market to help us grow and continue to succeed in this region.
Kurt Hallead: That's great. That's great color. I appreciate that. So maybe a follow-up here as you kind of referenced significant opportunities to tap into the production spending profile, your customer base and hence, the dynamic related to the ChampionX acquisition. When you look at the production chemicals piece of the business, ChampionX is a clear leader there. And just kind of curious as to, is there, for a lack of a better phrase, like some secret recipes and production chemicals that you guys are bringing to the table that could potentially enhance margins and substantially boost the revenue growth rate or boost the ChampionX position?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think there are multiple aspects to this, okay? First and foremost, I think we have been operating also in production chemicals, albeit at a smaller scale in the international market. We are actually having quite a portfolio in reservoir chemicals that are helping us extract recovery and optimize our intervention and stimulation program also in international markets. And we believe that combining this will help us open and compare and optimize fit for reservoir solutions, fit for process facility solution. And I think we both are coming from different positional strengths. We have a process portfolio, equipment process portfolio, both onshore and onshore. We have reservoir chemicals and subsurface domain expertise and fluid expertise and they have obviously fluids and understanding of the reservoir, of the production chemistry portfolio. So I think combining both, I think, is, in our opinion, a unique opportunity and the feedback from customers is indicating that they see a lot of potential in this combination. We'll obviously try to add and extend this to a full integrated production solution, including digital including lift solutions, including intervention and including process equipment optimization that we deliver on FPSO and other places. So the place where this will have further effect, in my opinion, is an offshore environment. And also, we will compare and complement each other on trying to find low carbon and solutions that help also created further differentiated portfolio of sustainable production chemical portfolio for the market. So we have quite an upside in technology, in addition to having an upside on market expansion to use our international footprint to complement the strength of ChampionX production chemical in North America.
Kurt Hallead: Thanks, Olivier. Appreciate it.
Olivier Le Peuch: Welcome. Thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Luke Lemoine: Hey, good evening. Olivier, on carbon capture, understand what SLB is doing and what Aker is doing. But can you help frame how you see this business developing along with how the combinations greater than the two stand-alone entities?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. Great question. First and foremost, I think we see CCS is certainly the most obvious and the most attractive market, total addressable markets adjacent to our space where we can contribute to decarbonization of the industrial space. So we believe we are first at market position and a lot of play into the sequestration through our technology, to our digital and solution to deliver not only site selection, but also site characterization and development of sites for carbon sequestration. So that's -- and by doing this, we have significant access to a large number of customers within oil and gas through that, and beyond oil and gas through the operator, the emitters, that are willing to develop. So we have this as a starting point that give us market access across many of the FIDs and many of the projects, and we quoted more than 30 projects, we are always part of at any point in time. And I think we have had quite a lot of experience there. So we also have invested into capture technology that we have done, such as RTI for non-aqueous solvent, which are trying -- where we are trying to disrupt the intervention, we have to disrupt the economics of capture for low stream -- local concentration stream of CO2 in hard-to-abate sector. But what Aker Carbon Capture brings into this is a commercial solution platform or recommercialize that will serve us as a base for expansion for deployment of our capture technology. And also we'll build on the initial success they have had to deploy this platform to some European markets and use our footprint where we see the market evolving fast in North America, Middle East and in Asia and using this platform and being the go-to-market for this carbon capture solution that they are offering, but supplementing it with our innovation that we are investing in and using this as a platform to deploy innovation. So combining sequestration and capture to offer this combined opportunity for the customers as technology solution and using the platform of the commercial carbon capture, Aker Carbon Capture, that exists today, is commercial, and using it as a platform to deploy and add and supplement this with new disruptive technology. That's the purpose, and that's the intention we have, that's the ambition we have in this market.
Luke Lemoine: Okay. And then maybe on North America, it's a smaller piece of your business, but can you talk about how you see it developing over the course of the year past 2Q?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think we have been originally guiding and we are keeping our guidance that we believe that on a full year basis, it will be more muted than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, considering the softness of the market at the start of the year, the persistent low gas price, the capital discipline and also the consolidation in the market. And we expect, going forward, we guided low-single digit growth sequentially. We anticipate at the end of the year to still outperform the market that will see a year-on-year decline on the activity by posting muted, but positive growth. But the shortfall that we may have, considering this offset will be fully offset by international growth as we commented where we see resilience, and we see further growth potential in many markets. So hence, we have reiterated our full year guidance.
Luke Lemoine: Okay. Great. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: We'll turn the conference back to Olivier Le Peuch for closing comments.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following take-aways: first, the global energy landscape remains very compelling for our business. Demand for energy is accelerating, and this is resulting in strong activity dynamics that are closely aligned with our three engines of growth. We will continue to innovate with customers across our Core, Digital, and New Energy to meet this demand in the years to come. Second, SLB remains optimally positioned to harness the ongoing oil and gas cycle for further growth. We operate in the most resilient and fastest-growing markets internationally, and we have a unique portfolio of technologies and services that differentiate us in North America. Together, our unmatched footprint and offerings will continue to set us apart and drive our outperformance globally. And third, after a strong start to 2024 and with clear visibility into the year ahead, we look forward to achieving our full year financial ambitions and commitments to shareholders return. This is an exciting time in the industry, and I am fully confident in our strategy for the future. I couldn't hope for a better backdrop to continue delivering for our customers and shareholders. With that, we will conclude this morning's call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-19 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SLB Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs, James R. McDonald. Please go ahead.
James McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, highlight a number of achievements and share our thoughts on the outlook for 2024 and our financial ambitions. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results and will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. The fourth quarter was an impressive conclusion to the year's financial results. We grew revenue both sequentially and year-on-year and we achieved cycle high margins and cash flows during the quarter. Our strong performance was fueled by the international and offshore markets and was supported by robust sales in digital and integration of the acquired Aker subsea business. Throughout the year, we witnessed continued growth in the international and offshore markets, where customers are focused on enhanced production and capacity additions. We have also seen further investments in digital technologies for planning and operational efficiency. This is driving growth today and presenting opportunities into the future. The international shift in investment has accelerated during the year, with fourth quarter revenue growth driven by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa, where we continue to benefit from long-cycle developments, capacity expansions and exploration appraisal activities. Specific to offshore, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter as we grew our legacy portfolio and harnessed a strong performance from our OneSubsea joint venture. On this note, I would like to extend my thanks to the entire Aker subsea team who have joined us three months ago and have already contributed very well to our strong year and results. Exiting the year, our international revenue and margins reached new cycle highs, marking our tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth on the international front. And we delivered exceptional free cash flow of $2.3 billion in the quarter. Next, let me reflect on our accomplishments for the full year. We fulfilled our full year financial ambitions, growing revenue by 18%, surpassing our revenue growth target for the year and achieving adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Additionally, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, our highest since 2015. In the core, across production systems, Reservoir Performance and well construction, we grew revenue by more than 20% and expanded pre-tax operating margins by almost 300 basis points. This was driven by strong activity internationally and offshore, new technology deployment and strong product sales. Notably, we achieved our highest ever revenue in the Middle East, led by impressive growth in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and the East Mediterranean. Offshore also contributed positive momentum, led by remarkable growth in Brazil and Angola and very solid increases in the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, Guyana and Norway. This was supported by the contribution from the acquired Aker subsea business, which enabled us to expand in certain markets, mainly in Norway and Australia. Additionally, our fit-for-basin business model continued to deliver differentiated value in North America, resulting in revenue growth outperforming to the record. In digital, we continue to witness the adoption of our digital workflows and data AI platform as customers work to enhance efficiency and returns by integrating our connected and autonomous trading data and AI solutions. We now have more than 6,000 Delfi users and have generated 125 million compute hours, both representing more than 40% growth year-on-year. As a result, we achieved full year digital revenue of more than $2 billion with our new technology platforms comprised of cloud, edge and AI, growing at a CAGR of 60% since 2021. In new energy, we forged new partnerships and made new investments in capture technology for carbon capture and storage. We are seeing very positive momentum in this space. And we are actively participating in more than $400 million of CCS tenders globally. Additionally, in short-term and energy, we are partnering with government agencies in the Middle East on lower carbon electricity and in Europe on zero carbon heating and cooling solutions. As we advance our three engines of growth, we also continue to deliver for our customers and stakeholders, by achieving our lowest-recordable injury rate and highest level of operational reliability on record. This is also reflected in industry surveys, where we are growing customer satisfaction through performance and value creation. Finally, we reduced our emission intensity across Scope 1, 2, and 3 on the path to achieving our 2025 emissions reductions commitment. Moving forward, we are well-positioned to capture further growth, and I look forward to building on this strong success in the year ahead. I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering these impressive results. Turning to the macro. The characteristics of breadth, resilience and durability that have defined this cycle remain fully in place. This continues to be supported by the imperative of energy security to meet rising global demand, confirming our belief in the longevity of the cycle. After a year of demand growth in 2023, we anticipate further growth in 2024 that will continue to support the ongoing multiyear investment cycle. In international markets, growth momentum is set to continue with more than two-thirds of total investment taking place in the Middle East, offshore and gas resource plays. In the Middle East, growth will be led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which continue to commit significant investments to increase production capacity in both oil and on commercial gas, followed by Iraq and Kuwait. Meanwhile, in Asia, countries such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia and India are leading new gas exploration and development. Across our international basins, we anticipate strong activity led by Brazil and followed by West Africa and Australia. Looking across this wide baseload of activity, a significant portion is taking place offshore, while capital expenditure will continue their growth momentum in 2024. As a result, the rig count will continue to rise, mainly in the Middle East and Asia, responding to a strong FID pipeline in both shallow and deepwater. All in all, we see the potential for more than $100 billion in global offshore FIDs in both 2024 and 2025, underscoring the enduring strength of the offshore markets and supporting a very favorable subsea outlook for years to come. In this context, although geopolitical tensions persist in several regions, we do not expect any significant impact to activity in 2024, absent further escalation. Additionally, although we have witnessed short-term commodity price fluctuate over the past few months, long-cycle investment in the Middle East, offshore and gas markets remain decoupled from short-term pricing, which will continue to support the resilience of these markets. In North America, following a noticeable moderation of activity in the later part of 2023, we anticipate capital discipline to continue. Consequently, investment levels will be sustained at 2023 exit rates with minimum -- minimal increase in activity as the vision focused on sustaining record ARPU from last year. This will drive further adoption of technology as operators aim to further improve efficiency and recovery rates. Now let me explain how we expect these factors to drive our performance in 2024. In the international markets, we expect full year revenue growth reaching the mid-teens, led by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa. This growth will take place both onshore and offshore, with offshore benefiting from our newly formed OneSubsea joint venture, which enters the year with close to $4.5 billion of subsea production system backlog. We expect to deliver more than $4 billion in additional subsea bookings in 2024, open increase of more than 25% year-on-year as the market continues to expect. For clarity, when excluding the impact of Aker contribution and the expected decline in Russia, we expect double-digit international growth for the year. Meanwhile, in North America, although activity has moderated, we expect full year revenue growth reaching the mid-single digits, driven by our technology and leverage portfolio in both U.S. land and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Turning to the divisions. We expect all core divisions to grow led by Production Systems and Reservoir Performance. Digital integration is also expected to grow with digital growing in the high teens, primarily driven by new technology platforms, while APS remains flat. Directionally, we expect further margin expansions, driven by tight service capacity internationally, pricing and increased technology adoption. This will result in year-on-year EBITDA growth in the mid-teens. With continued growth in earnings, our profitability to generate cash and confidence in the long-term outlook, we are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors have approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. And we'll also increase our share repurchase program in 2024. Combined, we are targeting a return to return more than $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2024, an increase of more than 25% compared to 2023. Looking to the first quarter. We anticipate the typical pattern of activity beginning with the combined effects of seasonality and the absence of year-end digital sales. As a result, on a year-on-year basis, we expect first quarter revenue growth in the low-teens and EBITDA growth in the mid-teens. This will be followed by an activity rebound in the second quarter and further acceleration of growth in the second half of the year, particularly in the international markets. This will support the ambition we have set for the full year revenue and earnings growth. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet : Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.86. This represents an increase of $0.08 sequentially and an increase of $0.15 when compared to the same period of last year. We recorded $0.09 of charges during the fourth quarter of this year, $0.06 related to the devaluation of the peso in Argentina and the remaining $0.03 related to merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of the Aker subsea business, which closed at the beginning of the quarter. We anticipate that we will incur additional charges as integration activities continue over the course of 2024. Our full year 2023 revenue of $33.1 million grew 18% year-on-year. While this revenue is roughly the same as the pre-pandemic level of 2019, our adjusted EBITDA in 2023 in absolute dollars was 22% higher. As a result, our full-year 2023 EBITDA margin of 24.5% has expanded 430 basis points over this period on a similar revenue base. This highlights the high grading of our portfolio over the last few years, our significantly improved operating leverage and our favorable market position, particularly internationally and offshore. Fourth quarter revenue of $8.99 billion increased 8% sequentially, with the acquired of Aker subsea business accounting for approximately 70% of the increase. Fourth quarter pretax operating margin of 20.8% improved 52 basis points sequentially and 101 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 25.3% was 95 basis points higher than the same period of last year. I will now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter digital and integration revenue of $1 billion increased 7% sequentially, with pretax operating margin expanding 197 basis points to 34%. This growth was due to increased digital revenue across all areas, led by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.7 million grew 3% sequentially, primarily due to increased activity internationally, mainly in the Middle East and Africa. Pretax operating margin increased 88 basis points to 21.4%, representing the highest level of this cycle, driven by higher activity and improved pricing. While construction revenue of $3.4 billion was essentially flat sequentially as international growth of 2% was offset by a decline in North America revenue resulting from lower U.S. land rig count. Pretax operating margin increased 35 basis points sequentially. Lastly, Production Systems revenue of $2.9 billion increased 24% sequentially, largely due to the acquired Aker subsea business. Excluding this effect, revenue grew 4% sequentially due to strong international sales. Pretax operating margin expanded 153 basis points to 15%, its highest-level this cycle on higher sales of midstream, artificial lift and subsea production systems. Looking ahead to the full year of 2024. We expect continued margin expansion in our core, driven by sustained operating leverage, a favorable geographic mix and pricing tailwinds. In our Digital and Integration division, we expect margins to remain approximately at the same level as 2023 as digital margins will increase due to the accelerated adoption of our new technology platforms, while APS margins will decrease as a result of higher amortization expenses. All in all, as mentioned by Olivier, strong year-on-year revenue growth and continued margin expansion will result in adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-teens in 2024 when compared to 2023. Now turning to our liquidity. We generated $3 billion of cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the fourth quarter. This exceptional performance resulted in full year free cash flow of $4 billion, which is the highest level we have achieved since 2015. This was due to a combination of very strong year-end receivable cash collections, increased customer advances, improved inventory turns and the receipt of the prior year tax returns. As a result of this exceptional free cash flow performance, we reduced our net debt by $1.4 billion during the quarter to $8 billion. This represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Capital investments, including CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $742 million in the fourth quarter and $2.6 billion for the full year. Looking ahead, we will continue to be disciplined as it relates to our capital investments. Despite the continued revenue growth, our 2024 capital investments will remain at approximately the same level as in 2023. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock for a total purchase price of $100 million. For the full year, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Our continued capital discipline, combined with the confidence we have that 2024 will be another year of strong cash flow generation, which enable us to increase our returns to shareholders in 2024. In this regard, when combining the increased quarterly dividend that we announced today, with increased share repurchases, we are targeting to return more than $2.5 billion to our shareholders in 2024. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch : Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we will start the Q&A. So Leah, back to you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we go to the line of James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: So Olivier, curious to hear your thoughts. Clearly, you're looking for another year of pretty strong growth in EBITDA and revenue. But it seems to me like we've got a lot of particularly deepwater rigs that are going to start turning to the right here very soon and particularly in the second half, and it's -- there should be an exit rate that's even higher than that type of growth as we go into '25. I think, is that a fair assumption, or am I getting ahead of my skews here in terms of kind of what the overall market opportunity is going to be as we step through this year and get into the '25, '26 period?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, that's correct. I think, James, thank you for laying out, I think, the theme of offshore, I think offshore is a distinct attribute of this cycle as really already delivered in terms of total activity visible beyond 2019 and includes both shallow and deepwater that have both grown visibly in the last 24 months. Shallow mainly driven by addition of rigs that we continue to see coming in the Middle East and Asia region and deepwater across all the deepwater basins. And we anticipate, albeit at a more moderate rate for deepwater and shallow, the rig activity to continue to increase and the exit rate of '24 to be above in terms of rig count, offshore rig count, total offshore rig count, the total exit range of ’23. As a benefit, I think both the offshore activity and deepwater, where we have the benefit of the scale with our subsea venture will benefit. Hence, we continue to see growth, not only in '24, but running out to '25 and beyond. As I said, the total FID offshore keeps paying $100 million for each of '24 and '25, and this is not only supporting activity next year and '25, but support longevity of offshore investment beyond. So we are -- we remain very constructive on that environment. And yes, we see the exit rate to be above the last December in 12 months from now.
James West: Okay. Perfect. That's great to hear. And then maybe a quick follow-up in terms of CapEx. I don't know if, Stephane, if you want to take this one, but CapEx seems to be -- it seems like you're going to keep it at the same type of level that it's been, that wasn't in '23, but there's going to be a lot of -- a lot more activity. And so does that number eventually need to move higher? And when it does -- if it does, do you still believe that you can maintain this 5% to 6% of revenue for CapEx dollars ratio.
Stephane Biguet : So look James, yes, we are still growing going into '24 and beyond. But this level of CapEx we spent in '23, we think remains adequate for this year as well because you have to think about the mix of activities as well amongst all divisions. So we think we can very well address the upcoming growth within this envelope without having to increase normally throughout the year, unless growth is much more than expected. But we were comfortable with this, and we will remain indeed within our guidance, and it's actually the low end of our guidance on the CapEx side.
Operator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays.
David Anderson : So maybe I can start off with the Middle East here. So another double-digit sequential quarter on EMEA, clearly, an enormous runway of activity in front of you the next several years between unconventional gas and the number of capacity expansion projects underway. My question is how you see top-line versus margins evolving? Can you maintain this pace of growth in the region in '24, or are we getting close to capacity in terms of the number of rigs available, service equipment, the E&C capacity here is pretty tight over there? And I guess, conversely, should we start seeing margins expand further as contracts reprice due to tightness in some. I noted that the tendering of Safaniyah was delayed by nine months. I'm wondering maybe there's some sticker shock from pricing. So perhaps is already underway, but just a little bit more details in terms of capacity and pricing in the Middle East, please?
Olivier Le Peuch : Yes. Thank you, Dave. I think we have been very pleased with the activity and the way we have been able to turn this activity growth in the last 18 months and the last 12 months, particularly into revenue, benefiting from our strength on the ground in the Middle East. I think I would characterize beyond the capacity expansion and on commercial gas, which is a dual benefit for activity. I will also characterize the activity in the Middle East to be very broad. It's not two country leading this, it's almost every country in the region that we see further activity and will derive from its further revenue growth. So we are not at capacity. We don't see an inflection down of our revenue growth potential in the region, benefiting from our technology market position with every national company in the region and capability for integration to harness the part of our technology into performance for our customers, hence delivering higher revenue from rate of activity. So we are confident. When it comes to our capacity, yes, equipment capacity and everybody has been disciplined in the region. And hence, we have been responding and benefiting from pricing in the last 18 months. And as a consequence, our margins have expanded in the region and have supported what you have seen as our international margin expansion year-on-year have been a driver for margin expansion internationally. We expect this to continue as we execute 2024. But again, it's a long duration cycle, both by the nature of the investment decoupled from short-term pricing on commodities. So we remain very confident about our market position first and the market outlook and our ability to differentiate through performance, integration, technology and then continue this success in '24 and '25 and again, well into the second half of the decade.
David Anderson : Yes. A long way from the peak. That's pretty clear, at least that part of the region. I was wondering if we could shift over on the digital side. I know there are a number of comments in the release today regarding increasing digital adoption by your customers. I was hoping you could expand on that a little bit. Is that simply about customers using Delfi more or as they get more comfortable with it, is there a certain application gaining traction? Is there any metrics you can give us in terms of year-over-year usage from your bigger customers? And I'm also just kind of curious, in order to grow digital revenue by essentially 50% over the next two years, is this primarily coming from an increased digital adoption of existing customers? Or do you also need new customers to get to that target?
Olivier Le Peuch : Okay. Let me come back first on some metrics that I think we have highlighted into my opening remarks. And I think this relates to the adoption of Delfi indeed, adoption of a number of users, use of cloud compute on our Delfi platform and use of additional hedge or AI capability that we offer to customers. The combination of which, as I said, has grown 60% in the last two years on a CAGR rate and the adoption metrics that we shared, both the number of users and the number of hours of complete power that we serve to our customers on the cloud have been growing by 40%. So yes, the adoption is going, both measured by, as I always said, one customer at a the time that transition from our legacy desktop offering to our cloud. And by expansion of our workflows, data, AI capability that we offer to existing or new customers. So it's a combination of a transition of the existing customers to the cloud and adoption of data and AI capability because we are offering our platform that the industry is recognizing adopting. And finally, and maybe one of the most exciting parts that adds a dimension of growth is the digital operation, both drilling and production digital operation. You have seen some of the announcements that have been highlighted in recent weeks and months. And last week, further alignment with a partner to accelerate doing automation and autonomous systems. So the drilling adoption on the operation production with our partner, Cognite. And this is supplementing, I would say, the core growth of transitioning our real sound customers from desktop to the cloud. So you have three dimensions. You have the cloud transition with existing customers and adoption of new customers coming to SaaS solution. You have the data and AI. It’s a new market. It’s a reverse of the data management that scale into the cloud and AI, unlocking the power of data through AI in our industry; and finally, digital operation. These three trends are supporting our growth ambition, both this year and next year. And this span all the customer segment across the globe, and you keep seeing some announcement of customer adoption on our solutions.
Operator: Next, we go to Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
Scott Andrew : I want to touch on transition technologies, you noted over $1 billion in sales. And I realize a lot of these are new and focus on emissions reduction. And I believe that the bucket there is separate from new energy, correct me if I'm not accurate. Olivier, I wanted to ask about the outlook for these technologies and the growth of sales of these technologies as the uptake by customers around the world seems pretty strong. Can you speak to the multiyear outlook? And is the cadence of growth for transition technologies additive to the growth rate from the core?
Olivier Le Peuch : No, I think you are correct first in stating that this is the distinct from our focus on the five themes that we have in new energy. And this thing from the CCS, I mentioned where we have a lot of success in geothermal. And it represents a portfolio of technology that we have, that we are developing, that we are promoting to our customers that have a distinct lower emission carbon intensity compared to existing or legacy technology and have net effect on our customer for their Scope 1 or their Scope 3 upstream as we call it, emissions, but also have the characteristic to bring efficiency. So customer is looking for low-cost, low-carbon outlook and continue to adopt this technology by contrast with alternate technology that exists in the market as they deliver not only lower carbon, but also deliver higher efficiency, which are the way we characterize this technology. So yes, we are very pleased adoption. Some technology are very unique like almost zero-carbon cement solution. Some solutions are really game-changing such as some of our both processing subsea processing solution that having a net impact on the carbon footprint of subsea operation. Some technology are disrupting for the future, such as electrical full subsea and electrical full completion technology. And hence, we are seeing accelerated adoption of this. And finally, we say that we are also seeing following the COP 28 much more interest into our methane emission management solution, and you have had the announcement we made with Eni, supporting them as a global company to make an assessment and be assessing their emission intensity from methane and proposing abatement solutions. So this is a mix of technician will continue to be going in our technology mix and that supports our ambition for sustainable future and a balanced planet, but also aligned with our customers on lower carbon, lower-cost future.
Scott Gruber : Right. Got it. Appreciate that color. And then Stephane, one for you. I appreciate the cash return target for '24. Can you also provide some broader color on the cash conversion rate? The working capital release in 4Q was very impressive. So curious thinking about the working capital outlook for '24 tax rate, et cetera.
Stephane Biguet : Scott, yes, we were also very pleased with the fourth quarter and full year free cash flow and indeed in the fourth quarter, it's coming almost entirely from the working capital. So now we do expect, as I say, 2024, to be another very strong year of free cash flow, and it will show the same quarterly pattern we usually see. So in the first quarter, the working capital will clearly increase. We have the payment of annual incentives to employees as you may know. And then we'll have the reversal of certain exceptional items that occurred in the last quarter of 2023. So we'll see the effect in Q1 as usual, but then this will be followed by a gradual improvement in subsequent quarters, in line with what we observed this year. So hopefully, we can have another very strong finish of the year in 12 months from now. And deliver a strong performance as well.
Operator: Next, we go to Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.
Luke Lemoine: Olivier, you noted the booking and backlog at OneSubsea. In last call, you talked about some of the commercial and operational objectives. And I wanted to see if you could just talk about how customer engagement and dialogue has progressed with the enhanced offering you now have?
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Luke. I think, let me please first with the first quarter of the subsea joint venture we have with Aker and Subsea7. I think the results speak for themselves. I think it was a direct contributor to the PS, the pollution system, performance in the fourth quarter, both on the top line and the margins. So we are very pleased. And I think as I said, I could not be more pleased than this. Now going forward, I think our objective continues to be to extract more value to synergy and to fully seize this deepwater offshore cycle that is in full fledge happening and where we see, as I said earlier, a strong outlook. So our priority is still benefit from integration capability, and as you have seen that we have announced some alliance and one of them with BP, where I think customers are approaching us organizing that subsea integration capability across the SPS and SURF are augmented by our ability to deliver and understand the reservoir as well as deliver well construction. So hence, opportunity to have integrated asset development, integrated tieback delivery and more opportunity in the space that is a full intake subsea and beyond to extract better economics and to extract more importantly -- equally importantly, a higher recovery combining our reservoir subsurface domain expertise are well placement and our subsea boosting and processing capability, all combined to extract and create a little bit of more value for subsea market going forward from economics and from production recovery. So that's where we see trends coming. And we have a portfolio that is unique with the portfolio partially on the boosting and processing and tieback capability that is unmatched in the market. And we have digital reservoir technology and our core portfolio that complements this and help and will support this alliance integration capability. So I can only be pleased with the prospects ahead of us and the feedback from our customers so far is very positive on our capability.
Operator: Our next question is from Saurabh Pant with Bank of America.
Saurabh Pant : Olivier, maybe I want to touch on exploration a little bit. You talked about that on the call today. You highlighted Asia. I think you talked about China, Malaysia, India, some of the other countries exploring for gas. I know you've talked about the exploration in the past. So, we are seeing at least a little bit of a tangible recovery happening on the exploration side. Maybe you can expand on that a little bit. What do you expect over the next couple of years on both the gas and the oil side. And just maybe remind us how impactful that is for SLB?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, thank you. I think, yes, we have commented before that we have seen resurgence and rebound of exploration activity solution appraisal in the last two or three years. This cycle has added exploration activity back to the cycle. And I think it has been driven by the desire to find new gas reserves to respond to the gas supply security concerns. And also, it has benefited from the continued exploration of oil around the existing offshore hubs in the form of infrastructure-led exploration. And also, in New Frontier replicating the success that Exxon had in Guyana and over basins. So when you look at it from where it is happening, what is unique in this cycle, it's happening everywhere. We have exploration activity, mostly offshore, that's where I think the actual success of new reserves have been mostly and in all offshore basins, both shallow and deepwater, infrastructure-led exploration in existing mature or deepwater markets and in New Frontier. So you have seen New Frontier happening in Namibia. You have New Frontier in Suriname and upcoming Brazil control margin. You have exploration in East -- West Colombia side. You have a furthermore in West Africa South. And you have what is maybe a little bit new this cycle, more exposure coming back in Asia from India, as I said, to Malaysia, China. And I think this is what constitutes a little bit of the unique cycle is broad. And it is here in our opinion to stay because the economics of offshore have improved significantly over the last couple of cycles and attribute of reserves, both gas and oil with low carbon intensity and the ability to deliver a long plateau of production is unique. So access to offshore acreage, better economics, better quality of potential geological reserves have all driven this, and we have increased the success. And we have exposure in reservoir performance with reservoir performance evaluation segments that are benefiting from it and has introduced technology that are really in high demand like Ora. And we have a lot of exposure, obviously, as well in the digital segment with our seismic data capability processing and our digital geoscience offering that both benefit from this as a consumption. So we are pleased with the market position we have, and we believe that this exposure appraisal is here to stay because it's very broad, diverse and across many basins partly in offshore.
Saurabh Pant: Fantastic. Okay. I have one very quick follow-up, if I may, on the Middle East side. I know you talked about that on the prepared remarks and the Q&A early on. But just to go back to that, I think one thing you noted in the press release was that you expect the record Middle East growth to continue beyond 2025. If you can elaborate a little bit, Olivier, on what gives you the confidence, the line of sight beyond 2025? Maybe part of that is just the gas side of things, not just oil, right, but elaborate a little bit on the light of sight you have beyond 2025 on the Middle East.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think first, you have to realize that the capacity expansion program announced by the multiple country that have met their commitments extend from 27 to 30 plus, 30, 35 or 40 from the last country that have expanded this. And hence, I think the capacity will be -- continue to be seeing addition both land and offshore to respond to that capacity expansion. Gas, I think, is here for the long in the Middle East for 2 reasons. First, there are gas reserves that are really at a very good economic point, partially in Qatar, and we continue to present an LNG feed to the global gas market, but also unconventional reserves are seeing a significant investment, and we expect this to actually grow fast in the coming years in two or three countries that are focused on commercial gas. So the combination of this is giving us the confidence that the record ever investment that we have seen last year in Middle East will continue in ‘24, ‘25 and has potential to expand well into the second half of the decade.
Operator: And our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta : A couple of questions for me. The first is on EBITDA margins. Congrats on crossing that 25% EBITDA margin mark. How should we think about the margin path in 2024? And as you think about the upside and downside factors that could drive you on that metric, how should we think about that?
Stephane Biguet : Clearly, we see upside in '24 and continued margin expansion as we expressed earlier, really, the -- I'm sure you will calculate, but our guidance of mid-teens EBITDA growth in absolute dollars will be achieved with revenue growth, but clearly with margin expansion across our core and in digital, as I mentioned. So yes, we continue to see margin expansion. We have great operating leverage. We have pricing tailwinds in our in our backlog and new technology adoption, and this is pushing margins together with the favorable mix, as you well know, offshore is helping margins as well. So, it's subside -- it's continue to subside from now on.
Neil Mehta : Okay. It does sound like geo mix, operating leverage pricing, a lot of different factors there. That's helpful. And then in terms of North America, I recognize it's a smaller business for you, but you indicated in the comments you expect North America to grow in 2024 despite weaker rig count and activity. Can you talk about what's driving that and how you're able to outperform in the face of a tougher North America macro? And where are you seeing the technology adoption from a customer perspective?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, we're very pleased with our performance in North America in retrospect in 2023 as we visibly outperformed the rig count, and we were able to grow in sequentially visibly. And we expect indeed to continue to outperform the market, and it comes from multiple factors, the mix factor of exposure we have with great exposure in Gulf of Mexico as well as East Canada and Alaska, we will see a potential of technology adoption and giving us the benefits of our mix. But also in the U.S. land market, I think we had a transition to a fit-for-basin and technology leverage focused portfolio in U.S. land and to some extent, in Canada. And we have seen this as a success with adoption of some really unique drilling technology in particular digital CCS giving us the tailwind to outperform the market in 2023, and we see this continuing. Now the priority for customers remain clearly efficiency and recovery in U.S. land market and hence, more efficiency on the trading well construction side, more recovery, use of digital, use of ESPs and also low carbon when it matters. We'll continue to make the impact and serve us very well. And the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore market performance through integration performance to execution and reliability of our execution, I think, will continue to be paramount for our customers. And as long as we continue to deliver at this level, we'll get rewarded with market position and contract and pricing. And hence, we'll be able to outperform the recount, hence our guidance up to reaching the mid-single digit in 2024 against the market outlook.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram: I wanted to get your thoughts on what you're seeing in the international markets in terms -- perhaps you could compare and contrast the spending behavior you're seeing from the NOCs versus the IOCs?
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Arun. I think if I were to characterize at the highest level, I think that we have seen significant traction in the last two years and rebound of investment internationally by the international company with a delay coming from the contractual nature and also from the investment execution decision for a national company. We anticipate national company to actually grow faster in -- as we turn into 2024 led in particular by the Middle East region with leading NOCs clearly going. But I think the momentum we have gained, which was leading the pack to some extent in IOC in 2023. We expect due to the nature of our mix offshore exposure still a very solid exploration appraisal for a few of them will continue to give us momentum in the IOCs internationally. And I will not forget about the international independents that have a market position, partly in some offshore markets, and they are continuing to execute on their plan. And so we are pleased, and I think we are looking forward to the national company accelerating their relatively speaking, their growth in 2024 compared to the IOCs.
Arun Jayaram : Great. And my follow-up, Olivier, at the Analyst Day in 2022, you highlighted a target of $3 billion in new energy revenue by the end of the decade. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of where you're at in terms of that path to journey and maybe some of the areas where you're seeing the most traction today?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think as you remember and just resetting the scene for everyone, I think we had identified five domains in which we believe we have adjacency. We have potential, and we have a technology portfolio, we believe, to bring to market and disrupt and participate in new energy at scale. CCS showed you geothermal, geo-energy, energy storage, critical mineral. And hydrogen that are both -- that all of them have different horizons of growth and different scale potential for us. So, we have been, for the last two or three years, seeding investments, developing organically and inorganically technology position. We are very pleased with the momentum in CCS and geothermal going ahead of our expectation in terms of -- for CCS sequestration studies and participation to exploration in this market. And geothermal by its growth potential going beyond the established basins. So we believe that our $3 billion target would be a combination of organic growth on this adjacent market and inorganic development into the non-adjacent market. And we believe that CCS is likely to be leading in terms of potential contributor to this ambition, followed by likely hydrogen starting to be in a position that will more impact later part of the cycle in the next decade. So, we feel confident by the early investment we are making. I will feel confident about the development of the market, the support of the incentive across many regions and the early stage of success in CCS particularly as we execute this.
Operator: We have time for one more question. That is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read : Congratulations on the quarter. Olivier, I'd like to follow-up a little bit on the last question on the spending, IOCs, NOCs, international E&P, which you mentioned. We generally want to -- let's say, look at the oil strip or assume a flat oil price. If spending is going to increase second half '24, a fairly positive outlook as you showed kind of '25 and beyond. Would you characterize overall reinvestment by the industry is still too low? In other words, we don't need a higher oil price to get higher spending and investment or would you say we are simply dependent on oil prices. I'm just kind of curious the way you're looking at it from a, I guess, productive capacity these companies and countries need and where they sit on excess capacity today versus that oil price outlook.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think I will turn it a little bit upside down and I realize that, well, our operators are looking at it a national company, IOCs, then looking at the demand that we continue to grow throughout the decade and realize that if they continue to execute on the capital discipline, they need to accelerate the supply coming from international market to fulfill this demand that we continue to grow and will put more pressure on the demand-supply balance. So some of them are responding for to capacity expansion program. Some of them are responding by accelerating the exploration appraisal or their development of existing international acreage that they have and development. So that's what we see. It applies to both for oil and gas. And gas is being more driven by regional dynamics on either consumption or gas security access, be it Asia or be it East Mediterranean to feed Europe, Asia for energy security and domestic consumption. Both these factors are driven by demand. The economics at the current level still favorable for long-cycle investment. The price of offshore international development and the economics have improved through the cycle, the benefits of efficiency, integration, technology have turned into making the offshore investment more attractive for the long run. Hence, it has reattracted investments. I will not try to comment on the industry needs more or less. I think the industry is certainly having the incentives today and have put a program in place with the FID pipeline that confirmed that it is attractive. It would be met with demand in the long outlook. Hence, our confidence into the longevity of the cycle internationally and into the breadth and resilience across oil and gas of the investment profile we are seeing from operators.
Roger Read : And then the follow-up question that kind of ties into that. Obviously, a meaningful dividend raise here and a consistent increase in dividend from the COVID era. But as you look forward, recognizing it's the board that decides the dividend, but how should we think about the dividend evolving back to the sort of 2014 and 2019 era, when it was substantially higher than today? I know there have been some changes in acquisition and share count and all that, but whether it's an aggregate dollar dividend or a per share metric, how do you think about the dividend within the overall framework here?
Stephane Biguet: Thanks for the question, Roger. It's really the way we look at it is it goes beyond the dividend. We prefer looking at the total payout to shareholders, including buybacks. So the dividend itself, yes, 10%. We're happy. We can do this. We're happy it was approved by our board. It's on the back, of course, of the strong free cash flow generation we had in '23 and our confidence we can replicate that in the future. But we want to go at the right pace so that it remains sustainable in the future, and we can do more dividend increases in the future as long as they are reasonable. But again, total payout is what we are focusing on. We are increasing it from $2 billion in '23, including buybacks to hopefully more than 2.5 in 2024. So, if you back calculate this, of course, with the new amount of dividend, that means a minimum of $1 billion of share buybacks. And as the year evolves, we will review that every quarter, and we'll address that potentially above the $1 billion minimum as relevant.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, I'll turn the conference back to Olivier Le Peuch for closing comments. Please go ahead.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results underscore SLB's differential ability to general returns throughout the cycle. We delivered strong revenue growth and free cash flow above expectations and continue to expand EBITDA and operating margins. With momentum across our three engines of growth and our returns-focused strategy in place, we will continue to build on this success in the year ahead. Second, the macro environment remains very compelling for our business with investment and activity predicated in international and offshore basins. Combined with tight service capacity and an emphasis on performance and digital, we are well positioned to expand our lead by delivering exceptional value to our customers. Finally, I remain very confident in our strategy and impressed by the outstanding performance of our teams. I'm fully confident in our ability to deliver our 2024 financial targets and continue increasing shareholder returns. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. With this, I will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-20 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SLB Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs, James McDonald. Please go ahead.
James McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York City, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my remarks this morning, I will begin by reviewing the third quarter financial results we represented in today’s earnings release. Then I will discuss the progress we are achieving across our three engines of growth and the macro environment supporting that. And finally, I will share our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open the line to your questions. Our third quarter results are built upon the positive momentum we established in the first half of the year and firmly position us to achieve our full year financial ambitions. We continued to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA both sequentially and year-on-year, and we generated free cash flow of $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. Internationally, we continued to seize the cycle. We achieved our highest international revenue quarter since 2015 by growing revenue in this market for the ninth consecutive quarter year-on- year. This was particularly visible in the Middle East & Asia, where we posted 22% year-on-year revenue growth, led by significant growth in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Egypt. Our strong international activity was further augmented by resilient investment in the offshore markets, notably in Africa, Brazil, and Scandinavia. Offshore continues to offer many opportunities for our business, and I will shortly discuss how the recent closing of our OneSubsea Joint Venture with Aker Solutions and Subsea7 will help us to expand our footprint in the market moving forward. And in North America, although revenue decreased sequentially due to lower activity, we continued to grow year-on-year, outperforming the rig count. Once again, our focus on the quality of our revenue combined with the differentiated value we deliver through technology drove margin expansion. Our EBITDA margin reached a new cycle high of 25% and our pre-tax segment operating margin expanded for the 11th consecutive quarter year-on-year. These are very positive results and I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering this strong performance. Next, I would like to share some updates about our progress across our three engines of growth: Core, Digital, and New Energy. Let me begin with the Core. The oil and gas sector continues to benefit from a broad, durable, and resilient multiyear growth cycle that is being supported by long-cycle developments, production capacity expansions, exploration and appraisal, and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for the energy transition. These market fundamentals remain very compelling for our Core business, which has grown 22% year-to-date and has materially expanded margins. This strong performance is being driven by the diversity of our portfolio, our industry leading technology, and our unique integration capabilities. Reservoir Performance achieved exceptional results with stronger evaluation activity; Production Systems achieved its highest level of margins in the cycle led by Subsea, Surface, and Artificial Lift; and Well Construction maintained impressive results through new technology innovations and differentiated performance. All in all, this was a very strong quarter across our Core divisions. The supportive macro environment is also leading operators to make long cycle investments offshore, where advances in efficiency have significantly improved project economics. We have visibility into FIDs extending well beyond 2025, and there couldn't be a better time to join forces with Aker Solutions and Subsea7 to drive a new era for subsea. Today, SLB is recognized for its unique ability to handle large, complex, and fully integrated offshore projects from subsurface development to midstream processing. Through our OneSubsea joint venture we will further enhance this offering by bringing new levels of technology and partnership to the market. Together, our companies are the clear leader in subsea multiphase boosting and subsea gas compression, and we will provide electrification and digital solutions to further enhance the business. This partnership approach will also create a more flexible customer offering through scale, increased capacity, and life of field services. Collectively, this will drive meaningful change to subsea asset performance as we partner with customers to help them unlock their reserves, drive efficiency, reduce cycle times, and reduce emissions in the deepwater market. Now, let me turn to Digital. On our call last quarter, I shared an update on the emerging digital trends shaping the industry. These included the adoption of cloud computing, the power of data and AI at scale, and digital operations gaining maturity. At a recent investor conference, I discussed how SLB is capitalizing on this opportunity with our platform strategy comprising of a workflow platform that serves as the backbone for our customers' planning and operations and our data and AI platform that unlocks data at scale for digital transformation. Today, we are seeing increased digital adoption across the industry. Delfi continued its year-over-year growth momentum with a 49% increase in users and an 89 -- 86% increase in compute hours compared to the third quarter last year. Additionally, our customers are embracing our connected and autonomous drilling solutions, with 1.9 million feet of automated drilling completed in the third quarter, an increase of 60% year-over-year. As a result, SLB’s platforms representing our new digital technology offering, sustained growth at a CAGR rate of about 60%. The benefit of these technologies is clear, and you can see this illustrated in our earnings press release this morning, with our Shell/AWS collaborative agreement and the Kuwait Energy Basra Limited digital oilfield contract serving as just two recent examples of customers choosing SLB Digital technology to reimagine their workflows across the E&P value chain. And finally, let me quickly discuss some of the exciting opportunities in our New Energy business and Transition Technologies portfolio. As we address the energy trilemma, our industry has an imperative to decarbonizes operations. Two of the most immediate opportunities to do this are reducing methane emissions and scaling CCUS as a solution for mitigating climate change. Regarding methane, we have opportunities to address fugitive methane and flaring through better monitoring and leak detection. A few weeks ago, we launched a new IoT enabled methane point instrument for continuous monitoring that seamlessly connects to our methane digital platform for insights and analysis, eliminating the need for intermittent site visits and enabling operators to quickly scale up across their operations. This and other solutions are available today to help clients abate their methane emissions. And in CCUS, momentum is building across the industry, both in oil and gas as well as in other hard-to-abate sectors. SLB is actively involved in more than 20 CCUS projects globally and we are investing in capture technology, as underscored by the partnership with TDA Research-highlighted in our earnings release. Overall, we are pleased with our pipeline of technology and projects, and we have confidence that by establishing ourselves as a leader in this space, we will create yet another avenue for diversified long-term growth. Now, I will turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued sequential revenue growth driven by year-end Digital sales and seasonal product and equipment sales in Production Systems. The quarter will also reflect the results of the OneSubsea joint venture. As a result, we expect overall sequential revenue growth to be in the high-single digits. With our continued focus on the quality of revenue, harnessing operating leverage, and further technology adoption, we expect to maintain global pre-tax segment operating and EBITDA margins at their highest levels in the cycle, in line with our third quarter performance. Stephane will provide additional color on the net contribution of the OneSubsea joint venture on our fourth quarter guidance. Turning to the full year, we expect to achieve the financial ambitions we shared back in January. Excluding the effects of the OneSubsea joint venture, we expect to conclude the year by increasing revenue more than 15% and growing EBITDA in the mid-20s, with recent North American headwinds being more than offset by strong international growth. With these strong full year results, we will remain well positioned to continue returning value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share was $0.78. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the third quarter of last year. We did not record any charges or credits during any of those periods. Overall, our third quarter revenue of $8.3 billion increased 3% sequentially. International sequential revenue growth of 5% was led by the Middle East and Asia, which increased 8% while North America revenue decreased 6%. Sequentially, pre-tax segment operating margin increased 73 basis points, which resulted in incremental margins of 48% largely due to the high-quality international revenue. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter reached 25%, the highest level since 2015. On a year-on-year basis, third quarter revenue increased 11% as international revenue grew 12%, while North America revenue increased 6%. The strong international performance was led by broad-based growth across the Middle East and Asia and offshore markets. Let me now go through the third quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $982 million increased 4% sequentially with margins decreasing 2 percentage points to 32%. The sequential revenue growth was primarily driven by increased APS revenue and increased digital revenue, including higher sales of exploration data licenses. Margins declined sequentially as lower profitability in APS more than offset improved digital margins. Reservoir Performance revenue of $51.7 billion increased 2% sequentially while margins improved 190 basis points to 20.5%. These increases were due to strong international growth, a favorable technology mix and improved pricing. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 2% sequentially led by strong growth in the Middle East and Asia which was partially offset by lower revenue in North America. Margins of 22.1% increased 38 basis points driven by the international markets. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.4 billion increased 2% sequentially as international revenue increased 7% led by the Middle East and Asia and Latin America. North America revenue decreased by 8% due to lower subsea activity. Margins expanded 147 basis points to 13.5% representing the highest margin since we began reporting results for the division. This expansion was primarily driven by higher sales of completions, artificial lift and surface production systems as well as pricing improvements. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of just over $1 billion. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, our net debt reduced sequentially by $731 million to $9.4 billion. Our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.2 is at its lowest level since 2015. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $640 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 million to $2.6 billion. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter for a total purchase price of $151million. We continue to target to return $2 billion to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. Before closing, I would like to add some color to the Q4 outlook that Olivier just provided. We are expecting sequential fourth quarter revenue growth to be in the high-single digits with pre-tax margins remaining at the same high-level we achieved in the third quarter. As Olivier highlighted, this outlook includes the contribution from the recently acquired Aker subsea business, which will be consolidated under our Production Systems division starting in the fourth quarter. The Aker subsea business is expected to contribute approximately $400 million to $500 million of incremental revenue in the fourth quarter with pre-tax operating margins in the low teens. Therefore, excluding the effects of the acquired Aker subsea business, SLB's fourth quarter sequential revenue growth is expected to be similar to the sequential revenue growth we experienced in the third quarter. SLB's organic pre-tax operating margin, again excluding the effects of the acquired Aker business, is expected to continue expanding sequentially. After considering the impact of below the line items relating to this joint venture such as amortization of intangibles, taxes, and non-controlling interest, this transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to our fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits. In closing, we are very excited about the prospects of this venture, which strengthens our offshore portfolio and has the potential to deliver more than $100 million of net annual synergies starting year three after closing. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open the line for your questions. Leah, if you may open the lines.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning, Olivier and Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Good morning, James.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
James West: So, Olivier, I know you recently returned from [technical difficulty] and most likely met with all of the major oil producers in the region. Can you [technical difficulty] thoughts on the Middle East and how we should think about the Middle East with respect to Schlumberger over the next several years, because it looks like it's going to be a huge driver of growth.
Olivier Le Peuch: No, thank you, James. I hope everybody could catch your question right into Middle East. Indeed, I have the privilege to be there for about a weekend and not only went to the conference and met a lot of customers in the region, but also had the benefit to go to operation in Saudi and visit the customer in south over there. So great insights. Needless to say that this is clearly the largest investment cycle, its clean on the way. The momentum is set. It's not about the concept and I think the sentiment across [indiscernible] shall be positive. Leah, there's a noise on the …
Operator: Yes, Mr. West, if you could mute your phone sir. Okay, you may proceed.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you. So if I were to characterize attributes, I think breadth, resilience, durability that we have characterized for the full cycle, I think are very much in full display in Middle East. I think the Durability 27 is the target for capital expansion. Breadth is not only old, but it's also gas as a driver for general vision or gas consumption and energy exports. Its offshore and onshore, its conventional and unconventional, and goes beyond one or two country that are very well known into Kuwait, into Iraq, into Egypt and more. And it's clearly decoupled from some of the short-term uncertainty. So it's all made about of long-term contract from the re-contracting to the service contract. And we are clear beneficiary of this situation. We have a unique footprint in the region. And indeed, we see that this will continue to support growth in the years to come for SLB. And this year, as stated before, we will record a record revenue in the region. And we will continue to grow and use this to be accretive to international growth and accretive to our international margin and the company. A great outlook in essence.
James West: That's great. Thanks, Olivier for that. Sorry about my phone issues here. Probably a follow-up for me, maybe for Stephane is on FX. How much was FX a headwind during the quarter?
Stephane Biguet: So, thanks, James. So, look, most of our revenue is built in U.S dollars. But indeed in a few countries, it's partially not the case for. So for some of us, we indeed had an unfavorable impact of the U.S dollar strengthening against local currencies. And that was both sequentially and year-on-year. I prefer I'm not giving you a specific amount as we have contractual adjustment clauses that come and offset the negative effect at least partially, but yes the revenue would have been slightly higher without that. And the last point here to remember is a lot of our cost as well are expressed in local currency. So we have a natural hedge on this. And the net impact on the earnings is quite marginally, it's limited.
Operator: We will move on to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Thank you. Good morning. Morning, Olivier. With Aker now part of the -- with Aker now part of the OneSubsea JV, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the value proposition of not only a larger subsidy entity, but how it fits kind of within the whole -- how now fits in a fully consolidated market. In terms of offshore worth in FIDs, obviously, the trending really couldn't be any better, but what is the larger, more robust OneSubsea going to Schlumberger as a whole? And then as a follow-up, if you could talk about some of the integration steps you're planning, culture is such a big part of Schlumberger. Just wondering how you're thinking about bringing in one of your long standing competitors into the fold and -- how do you think about culture in that sense? Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Great question, Dave. And I think indeed, we have been working on this. I'm very, very proud and I believe that the timing couldn't be better that closing this now as the onset of the offshore growth and the long duration that we see with SLB beyond 2025. So, if I had to take three key words, I would say technology fit, integration capability and scale are the three elements that I think resonate very well and create value for customers. Technology, whether we are enhancing and getting with this addition of a comprehensive portfolio that is fit to every deeper market that exists and that includes further capability, complimentary and capability in Subsea processing and also in own vehicles [ph] that complete the portfolio and allow us to fully participate and being differentiated in every basin, in every deepwater condition in the world. Integration, we bring and we keep our unique subsurface reservoir to processing capability that we had already in OneSubsea. But we are enhancing it with a larger and a very competent team running us for from a acquisition and engineering capability. So that we can take any deeper prospect and help customers and collaborate to get the best outcome and we are getting our Subsea7 partner to joining and to be aligned with making this a success, when and as we are required to deliver as integrated with us. So all in all, this is what the value brings in integration. Scale. Scale give us manufacturing footprint that give us flexibility, and the ability to respond fast and to respond to customer need everywhere and give us the unique life of field with the largest install base of subsidiary, where we will use digital ,we will use integration capability with our performance to provide further integration and further life of field and looking pollution recovery, if you like, long-term. So customer feedback is excellent at the onset. I think the customer really appreciate and recognize the recovery potential, the comprehensive technology portfolio, the lower emission, the digital and the integration capability. Culture. I think we have discovered throughout this engagement, that actually the culture are very much aligned. And I think we have had a day one set of events last week or 2 weeks ago that we're really our planning are aligned we are and our complementary culture and portfolio are to go into this. So I'm very optimistic, very positive and customer feedback is extremely positive to onboard this. And you may have seen the [indiscernible] in my opinion, which is a precursor, in our opinion, is what we can do to partner with our customers and to help unlock the future of subsea reserves and to impact their recovery, their efficiency and economics and their lower carbon outlook.
David Anderson: Obviously, all things that your customers are looking to achieve. If I could shift over to your digital business. Just more specifically, digital within D&I. APS has been kind of noisy this year between Canada and Ecuador. Kind of hard for us to get a real sense as to what's happening in software. In your release, you talked about higher sales or margins. I was wondering if you could provide a little more context around that. Have margins improved from a year ago? Is it necessarily about margins? You just gave some interesting statistics about increasing number of users, increasing computing time, and you also said 60% growth. Can you just repeat exactly what you meant by that? Is that the top line of that business? Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think we -- thank you, James (sic) [David]. I think we continue to be very positive about the digital business and its adoption with our customers. You will continue to see announcement being made from workflow and adoption for customers and also more and more announcement of digital operation, edge, AI, as you have seen many of them into our press release earlier today. So we are very satisfied with the momentum. And it's going, it's going fairly well. I think you are seeing that we have quoted that the new technology digital portfolio from workflows to operation is growing at a CAGR of about 60%. And I think this is in line with what we expected. And this is on top of the baseline that includes the legacy software maintenance and all the services, including the data sales that we do, that is somehow offsetting some of this, but still represents total growth. So we expect this growth to be very visible into the fourth quarter as we typically have a year-end sales effect. And we continue -- we expect this to continue and accelerate actually next year.
David Anderson: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we move to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning. Question on …
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: … the Production Systems outlook for margins post the Aker JV. Just how should we think about the path forward for margins in the business? I'm thinking about legacy contracts in Subsea rolling out that are largely lower margin, better price contracts rolling in. And then as you capture synergies, just what is a reasonable expectation for incrementals or where margins could go overall in Production Systems out over the next 2 years?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, Scott, simply said, we believe that we'll continue to have -- continue our journey of margin expansion. As you have seen, we have reached the highest level of margin in Production Systems since we have been reporting this division on the back of rolling in contract that in the backlog into revenue generation that are more accretive than the previous contract and at the results of not only the pricing environment that is more positive, but also the result of better supply chain and increased efficiency and use of additional technology that I think the entire team in Production System has been very good at selling to our customers. And I think, hence, the results now very specifically to the Subsea environment and the OneSubsea, we have been, a few months back, highlighting that our performance on Subsea is already in high teens as in previous or organic OneSubsea. The addition of the -- we expect to continue to and to recoup this margin and long-term continue to increase at this level and beyond. At Subsea, we will generate $100 million from year three on this OneSubsea joint venture going forward. So all in all, I believe that the element of our Production System portfolio are set to continue to not only grow, but also have incremental margin going forward. Hence, we expect the journey of margin expansion to continue next year and beyond. And the JV will be accretive to this.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then turning to North America, a couple of years ago, you tilted your sales model towards more product sales and fewer boots on the ground. But now we're going through a wave of consolidation amongst your customers. We're seeing more privates taken out and now potentially a wave of larger mergers. How does that impact your strategy in North America?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we have been very satisfied with the onset of our strategy and the deployment of strategy as we initiated it 4 years ago. I think we have turned out to be both appealing to the adoption of our technology products through partners, through this fit-for-basin and tech access model as well as our focused technology and focused fit-for-basin offering has been resonating with large public integrated company that have adopted our technology for performance purpose. As the market mature and as some consolidation will happen, we still believe that our technology performance, including impacts recovery. Digital will continue to resonate very well and will continue to be adopted very well by our customers. So we have an excellent exposure at this point to the public and integrated company. And I think this consolidation will give us opportunity to further showcase our technology, showcase our digital, showcase our fit-for-basin across both Production System and drilling well construction, in particular. And let's not forget that CCS is a new exploration world in NAM, this is also playing a critical role to our growth to through [indiscernible] performance and evolution portfolio is not Digital in that context. So we will continue to use tech access and fit-for-basin to be agile in this market to respond to the privates [ph] that are set to come back next year. And at the same time continue to engage with our larger customer and the customer that are at the top of our portfolio through technology and integration capabilities. So we are -- we believe we are set for success in this new mature market in NAM.
Scott Gruber: [Indiscernible]. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we move on to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Yes, good morning. I was wondering, Olivier, if you and Stephane could elaborate on kind of the margin performance in the core. In particular, you commented about pricing gains, particularly in Reservoir Performance. If you could highlight what you're seeing on pricing. And excluding, obviously, the impact from the close of the OneSubsea JV, would you expect similar margin expansion in the fourth quarter on a -- for the legacy SLB?
Olivier Le Peuch: So let me start. I will let Stephane comment on the margin because I believe he provided some remarks to that effect. First, I believe that the core is benefiting from three things, in my opinion. It benefits from differentiated performance in the eyes of the customer, and hence, is benefiting by this creating an opportunity to secure market position and commands a pricing premium or favorable commercial terms to support this performance. Performance is recognized. Performance is critical in all projects, but in deepwater environment and is something that differentiates us and it's being recognized. So performance is a key factor. The second, I believe, is technology. Technology adoption has been accelerating. I think the target and the basket of technology we have set this year, including the transition technology where we set a target for $1 billion for the year, has already been achieved year-to-date. And hence, we see technology adoption as being unique in this environment, has differentiated again on performance and differentiated on creating insight and features and differentiate the value for customer and being recognized. And that is accretive to the margin and that drives our margin in the core. Finally, integration, and I will put digital into this, the ability to intertwine and add digital capability to our integration has delivered value. And you see that the Well Construction is benefiting from high-level margin that are very much helped by integration and digital as well as performance. Back to Reservoir Performance. Reservoir Performance had a very strong quarter on the back of result performance evaluation, which is used in exploration appraisal particularly where our differentiated technology portfolio has, again, been recognized with a premium. So that is what we are benefiting from. Technology, performance and integration with digital are driving a differentiated value proposition recognized with a pricing premium with our customers.
Stephane Biguet: And relating to margins, Arun, for Q4, yes, we do expect excluding the effect of the Aker Subsea contribution to continue expanding margins, particularly the digital and integration margins will definitely improve from accretive year-end digital sales so that will clearly be a tailwind. And then we will have probably improved margins, I'd say, across the other divisions, particularly in Production Systems where we have typically year-end sales that bring good incrementals. So yes, continuous margin expansion, excluding the JV in Q4.
Olivier Le Peuch: And you could expect this to carry on in 2024 as we believe the attribute of differentiation, as I outlined before, and the favorable environment which we are operating partly internationally will continue to support margin expansion for the core.
Arun Jayaram: Great. My follow-up, Stephane, $1 billion of free cash flow generation in 3Q. Any thoughts on what could impact free cash flow in 4Q, just given working capital and just the OneSubsea JV? Just any things to flag?
Stephane Biguet: Sure, sure. So first, we are actually quite pleased with our free cash flow performance so far this year. It's indeed the second quarter in a row where we generate about $1 billion free cash flow. And it's really a combination, of course, of higher EBITDA, but also discipline in capital investments and an improved working capital performance quarter-after-quarter. So relating to Q4, we typically see a strong end of the year as it relates to free cash flow. So we are hoping that it will be the case this year as well. There are always moving targets based on customer collections. It's the main variability. But in general, we expect a strong free cash flow performance as we close the year.
Arun Jayaram: All right. Thanks gentlemen. 
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we move on to Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchi: Hi. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Marc.
Marc Bianchi: Good morning. You previously discussed an expectation for directionally $1.5 billion of EBITDA improvement in 2024. I'm curious what the underlying assumption for the JV is here, just so we can get a sense of how it's doing versus the what appears to be the fourth quarter run rate here.
Olivier Le Peuch: I don't think we will, at this point, comment specifically on next year. I think it's -- directionally, I think it's an indication that we gave. I think the market, as it stands today, we have under a scenario of international growth momentum and also North America coming to a year-on-year growth activity. I think we see a scenario by which indeed this guidance we gave on this scenario we outlined will materialize. But I will not go into the detail at this point until our Q4 conference call in January and until we have time to triangulate some of our expectations with the customer engagement. We will come back with more detail, including the contribution we expect for the JV Subsea at that time.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thank you. The -- another question on offshore, but specifically related to exploration. I think you earlier said that you expect 20% type growth in '23. I'm curious how that's playing out. And then can you remind us how large exploration is for SLB?
Olivier Le Peuch: We don't comment on exploration because exploration, I think, is an -- as a subset of market segmentation, touch many aspects, I think, primarily Reservoir Performance, but also digital, some of them are integration and obviously, some components of some PS and Well Construction. So all in all, we believe that the exploration appraisal market has been aligned with the international growth this year and I think has been an element of offshore momentum that has been set this year. I think the results of -- and margin that we have seen from the performance are very much a reflection of that success. We are seeing success as well in our digital sales when it relate to data exploration. And we are seeing that the campaign of appraisal that have been made around Africa, particularly continuing to be sustained and in the search of confirming these finds and to develop FID in '24, '25. So we are positive about the exploration. We don't see a setback for customers on exploration, and we see that the breadth of exploration appraisal in offshore and in onshore market is much higher than it was a couple of years ago. It touched many geographies and basins from Southeast Asia to obviously, Middle East, Africa and North and South America. It's very broad and that is what I think is quite unique in this cycle.
Marc Bianchi: Very good. Thank you very much.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Marc.
Operator: Our next question is from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. One moment please. Mr. Lemoine, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Luke Lemoine: Thanks. Olivier, good morning. You've alluded the enhanced capabilities of the new OneSubsea and maybe to fine tune it a bit more. Could you talk about what you'd like to achieve on a commercial basis and maybe qualitatively on an operational level within the first year and maybe the next few years as well?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think first and foremost is to continue to satisfy fully the customer base and the backlog that we have, respectively, from Aker Solutions, from the organic OneSubsea secured in the last 18 months. And I think execution will be the first priority, first and foremost, to make sure the performance by joining team would not be affected. And I think we have been reassured from the engagement that our team that this is the case. I think next, I believe that what we want to achieve is to demonstrate for every customers that we have in the portfolio today that the combination of our engineering, new technology portfolio, a broader portfolio and integration capability that SLB brings with Subsea 7 and the rest of the SLB portfolio is differentiated and will add value to all the backlog that we have. And third and maybe the most interesting and the most exciting part that we are seeing is that customer at the onset of this announcement have come to us for asking partnership to be explored so that we can unlock economics, we can unlock recovery, and we can accelerate the path to decarbonization of deepwater operation to you by the combining and using and leveraging the full portfolio we have. So I would say performance and execution. I would say, sell up and integration capability for technology. And finally, this partnership model that I believe will be defining the new era for Subsea.
Luke Lemoine: All right. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Yes, thank you. I had a couple of geography questions. The first is around North America, recognizing it's a smaller part of the growth driver of the business. But what are you seeing real time in this market? And do you think we're in a bottoming phase as we move into 2024?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Great question, Neil. I think indeed, our hypothesis for the way forward and [indiscernible] specifically discuss the U.S. land activity. The apologies we have is that by the combination of the gas price, creating a little bit of a pull on supply and a pull on activity on gas as well as the favorable oil commodity price. We create a pull on the private, E&P privates coming back into this market, the magnitude of which is, at this point, difficult to judge. And I think there are plenty of scenarios and it will be a little bit of the swing factor, more opinion in the 2024 planning. Yes, we believe that the trough is beyond us, so it's about, at this point, and we see incremental from H2 of this year in the U.S. market going forward, our biggest incremental gain. We will come back to that as we guide 2024. When it comes to North America offshore, I think here from Canada to Gulf of Mexico, we see a robust and steady activity going forward. And we see that will continue to benefit to our exposure, and the OneSubsea JV will continue to magnify this where we’ve opportunity to do so. And we are very satisfied with our performance there. So I believe that the activity and the outlook is, if anything, steady and has a potential for upside in 2024.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, Olivier. And then just a follow-up is on Russia. You put out a release a couple of months ago talking about how you continue to wind down the business, and our expectation is that's going to go to zero here. But just any update on where you stand there and any color you can give to the market? Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: As you could find in today's key [ph] document that we are releasing, Russia revenue percent approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue year-to-date. And we expect it indeed to decline as a percentage but not to zero in 2024. And any guidance that we provide will always include the Russia effect and how we anticipate this to happen. This has always been built in our model and does not impact our financial guidance, as I said. And I remind you that we continue to ensure that our remaining presence in Russia meets and exceeds all international sanctions.
Neil Mehta: That’s great. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
James McDonald: Leah, do we have any further calls on the line?
Operator: Yes, Mr. Hallead -- Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. You may go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning, everybody.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Stephane Biguet: Good morning.
Kurt Hallead: Olivier, I'm kind of curious, just this week, it looks like the U.S. has agreed to lift sanctions on the export of Venezuelan oil products. I know that Venezuela had been a fairly large market for Schlumberger prior to the sanction dynamics, and I think you guys have maintained a presence there. So just kind of curious as to what you think the opportunity could be once the sanctions are lifted in terms of providing incremental revenue growth.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it's early stage. I don't think it's -- it will be appropriate to comment on the size of the opportunity. But surely, I think we have that historically very strong track record and set of capability in country that have been dominant since we had to shut down the operation. But as soon as and we get support from our partners-customers into this, we will be responding and as fast as we can with mobilizing resources and equipment that is over there to respond and participate to this opening. But it's too early to say and it's too early to give a guidance of any thoughts on the impact it will have, but its potential and its upside, if it comes, indeed.
Kurt Hallead: That's great. Thanks. And I've got a follow-up. Just I know you referenced you expect Digital revenue to grow to be about $3 billion by 2025. Just kind of curious as to what contribution you think AI will have in that growth and whether or not the adoption rate of AI among your customer base gives you even greater conviction of getting to that level.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, indeed. I think for making sure that we are all aligned, we quoted that we expect the revenue of digital to double from '21 to '25 and to reach approximately $3 billion by '25. And indeed, very much a component of what we call the new technology, digital portfolio includes our ability to unlock data insights through AI, the ability to create and imagine new workflow to AI into and to support a key element of digital operations like autonomous drilling through AI. And you will see very soon some announcement of industry first that have used automation and AI to enable this automation, to enable these new insights. So we are very positive about what AI can bring to this. We have a unique capability. We have domain AI capability embedded into our platform. We have better IQ as a partner with ready-to-go portfolio of routines and AI capability that have been recognized as best-in-class and allowing our customers to rapidly unlock and use AI and scale AI into their application. And we have, for the last 1.5 years, launched our INNOVATION FACTORI which are labs that we use to collaborate for customers, and we have six of them across the globe, where we collaborate and we have more than 100 projects already achieved with our customers through this INNOVATION FACTORI. So a great pickup, and you may have seen during at APEC, we announced an AI project that we have released with our partners in the Emirates to support AI capability with ADNOC. So it's all over the place. It's in [indiscernible], it's in planning, and it's an execution in digital operations to [indiscernible] So it's picking up, and it would indeed hopefully contribute and give us that opportunity in 2025.
Kurt Hallead: That’s great. Thanks for the color.
Olivier Le Peuch: You’re welcome.
Operator: And our last question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Roger Read: Hey, thank you. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Roger Read: Olivier …
Stephane Biguet: Good morning, Roger.
Roger Read: I'd like to come to it from a margin standpoint. I mean, your margins are pretty fantastic here for certainly where we are in the cycle and everything like that. When we look back to the up cycle and there's still a ton of room to go, and I recognize this question may be premature relative to maybe an update when we are really looking more at '24. But what do you see as things that could lift margins from here? What do you see things that would restrain margins from reaching sort of max levels? Or what would we need to see in the market fundamentals to make a significant uplift from margins here?
Olivier Le Peuch: I don't want to, first, put a ceiling on the max on the margin we can achieve. I think the future and the market outlook will detect that. But most importantly, our ability to execute, to continue to execute on our performance strategy will continue to define our ability to capture, enhance our margin, whatever the market conditions are. And I think this is what we have been achieving for the last 4 years. And I think, again, technology differentiation, integration capability, augmented by digital and performance on everything we deliver is what is getting our customers trust us to give us premium and give us favorable commercial condition and further growth potential by better share of their business allocation. So I think, again, we initiated and we telegraphed fairly well 3 years ago that we'll be initiating a margin expansion journey. We have been on that journey for the last 3 years from the trough of 2020. We committed to expand. And I think we have delivered on this commitment. Some of you were looking forward to see when we will cross the 25%. Some of -- some scenario we are putting this in 2025. We said we would likely be able to cross this before. It came slightly ahead of our expectation because I think I'm impressed by what our team is able to deliver. And yes, the market conditions are favorable, but we expect that the breadth, duration and the resiliency of the cycle will continue. The effect of Middle East and offshore will continue to give us a favorable backdrop so that this strategy will continue to support margin expansion. So that's our belief. And again, I don't want to put a ceiling, I don't want to put a max, but I will continue to push my team to continue to extract the best and seize the cycle, as we say.
Roger Read: Sounds good. Good luck with everything and thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Roger.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you very much.
Operator: And I will turn the conference back over to the Schlumberger management team for closing remarks.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the ongoing oil and gas cycle continues to display the unique attributes of breadth, resilience and durability that closely align with our business strategy. In this environment, unparalleled offerings in our core, our ability to enhance value through digital and our investments in New Energy have us positioned during both today and tomorrow. Second, our international reach continued to drive our financial performance. As investment momentum has shifted internationally and offshore, our business is well positioned for sustained growth and will be further supported by our OneSubsea joint venture. Third, after posting an impressive 9-month year-to-date performance and with visibility into the fourth quarter and 2024, we remain confident in our full year and through-cycle financial targets. This is an exciting time for the energy industry, and SLB is ideally positioned for success across all time horizons. This is an excellent environment to continue delivering value to our shareholders. I remain fully confident in our strategy and look forward to another successful quarter and close to the year. With that, we will conclude our call this morning. Thank you, and good day everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-21 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by and welcome to the SLB Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the SVP of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs, James McDonald. Please go ahead.
James McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris, France, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover three topics. I will first review a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. Next, I will discuss the positive momentum we are seeing in the international and offshore markets. And third, I will share the exciting progress we are making in digital before concluding with our outlook for the third quarter and the full-year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open for your questions. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and our strategic positioning in the most attractive, accretive, and resilient markets globally. This is translating to financial performance, and we closed the first half of the year with solid growth across revenue, earnings per share, free cash flow, and expanded EBITDA and pre-tax segment operating margins. International revenue continued its strong growth momentum, increasing 21% year-on-year as we captured broad growth across all divisions and geographic areas. Second quarter revenue increased by more than 20% year-on-year in 14 of our 25 international GeoUnits. Most notably, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Mexico, Guyana, Brazil, Angola, Caspian, and India all grew more than 30% over this period. This drove our highest year-on-year international incremental operating margin over the last three years, and it underscores the breadth of our portfolio that I continue to emphasize. SLB's global reach shields us from regional fluctuations, as we have recently seen in North America, and give us the ability to seize opportunities wherever they arise. This is a true differentiator for our business and positions us for long-term outperformance. Following the remarks I shared in our earnings release this morning, I would like to reflect on a few notable highlights from the quarter. The broad growth characterizing this upcycle continues. Internationally, this was pervasive, and we were very pleased to see all divisions and geographies grow revenue and expand margins sequentially. In North America, we continued to increase our revenue, highlighting our agility across the land markets and the expanded activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, solidly outperforming the rig count. Our focus on the quality of our revenue continues to support our margins. Sequentially, we expanded our pretax segment operating margin. This was fueled by our strong international operating leverage, increased technology adoption, and positive pricing trends that stemmed from inflation-driven contract adjustments and tight service capacity. And with higher earnings and improved working capital, our sequential cash flow from operations grew considerably, and we generated free cash flow of nearly $1 billion during the quarter. I want to thank the entire SLB team for their hard work and exceptional performance delivering value for our customers and our shareholders throughout the quarter. Now, let me take a moment to touch on the macro environment. As we have projected for the past few quarters, the international and offshore markets continue to exhibit strong growth as North America has moderated. This is playing to the strengths of our business, as international revenue represents nearly 80% of our global portfolio, and offshore comprises nearly half of that. As the growth rate shifts further toward international, these market conditions are driving the breadth, resilience, and durability of this upcycle and creating new opportunities for our business. Let me describe where this is taking place. In the international markets, the investment momentum of the past few years is accelerating. This is supported by resilient long-cycle developments in Guyana, Brazil, Norway, and Turkey; production capacity expansions in the Middle East, notably in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar; the return of exploration and appraisal across Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean; and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for energy security and the energy transition. In the Middle East, this is resulting in record levels of upstream investment. From 2023 to 2025, Saudi Arabia is expected to allocate nearly $100 billion to upstream oil and gas capital expenditure, a 60% increase compared to the previous three years, as they invest to attain a maximum sustained production capacity of 13 million barrels per day by 2027. Several other countries in the region have also announced material increases in capital expenditures that extend beyond 2025. Furthermore, we continue to witness a broad resurgence in offshore driven by energy security and regionalization. Operators all over the world are making large-scale commitments to hasten discovery, accelerate development times, and increase the productivity of their assets. This is resulting in increased infill and tie back activity in mature basins, new development projects both in oil and gas, and support for new exploration. With this backdrop, we anticipate more than $500 billion in global FIDs between 2022 and 2025, with more than $200 billion attributable to deepwater. This reflects an increase of nearly 90% when compared to 2016-2019. These FID investments are global taking place in more than 30 countries, and we are seeing the results with new projects in offshore basins across the world. This is reflected in the many contract awards highlighted in the earnings press release, notably in Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey. These contracts, in addition to many others, are building a strong foundation of activity outlook decoupled from short-term commodity price volatility. Moving forward, we expect further growth to be led by accelerating activity in Well Construction, new opportunities for Reservoir Performance in exploration and appraisal, expansion for Production Systems in subsea; and digital will enhance it all. In our business and the industry as a whole, the increased adoption and integration of digital technologies remains one of the most significant opportunities for growth. Indeed, our industry generates massive amounts of data, and by capturing that information and turning it into trusted and actionable insights, we can make energy production more accessible, more affordable, and more sustainable. This is a critical moment for our industry, and there are three digital trends concurrently shaping its future, clearly setting the path for a higher value lower carbon outlook. First, the adoption of cloud computing at scale. For geoscience workflows, this is supporting significant productivity gains for geoscientists and engineers across asset development teams. This is happening at a time when our industry is compelled to accelerate the development cycle and de-risk both subsurface and surface uncertainties. We continue to benefit from this trend in the adoption of our Delfi cloud-based digital platform, delivered through a flexible and personalized software- as-a-service SaaS subscription model with the cumulative number of users in global customer organizations growing 60% year-on-year to 5400. As we shared in our earnings press release, Petrobras and ENAP are only just two examples of customers deploying Delfi enterprise-wide with the aim of fundamentally changing how they work across the E&P value chain. Second, our industry is unlocking the power of data at scale. A single well can produce more than 10 terabytes of data per day. And this doesn’t even begin to touch on the total amount of upstream data across exploration, development, and production workflows. The adoption of open data platforms across the industry is liberating data for artificial intelligence AI applications at scale. SLB is benefiting from and driving this trend through both data foundations and AI deployment. We are seeing early success with the commercialization of our Enterprise Data Solution powered by Microsoft Energy Data Services. This offering delivers the most comprehensive capabilities for subsurface data in alignment with the emerging requirements of the OSDU Technical Standard. And we are witnessing tremendous success with our Innovation Factori, where we have developed more than 100 AI solutions with more than 80 customers since 2021, all of them with rich domain content in addition to generic AI capabilities. Third, digital operations are gaining in maturity, transforming the way operators develop and utilize assets. From automation to autonomous operations across both well construction and production, we are clearly seeing an inflection in the deployment of digital operations with significant impacts on efficiency, carbon footprint, and performance. Today, customers are accelerating their adoption of our Neuro autonomous solutions, with Kuwait Oil Company and PETRONAS both using these technologies to reduce manual operations while increasing performance, enabling drilling consistency and rig time savings. Similarly, our partnership with Cognite as a platform for unlocking access to production operations is gaining momentum in the industry, as exemplified with the Cairn contract highlighted in our earnings release. Finally, we continue to deploy Delfi Edge Agora technologies to deliver real-time insights directly within operations from connected hardware, where data is generated and processed with AI at the edge. We currently have more than 1,400 connected assets deployed, doubling year-on-year. SLB is positioned to fully harness these positive market conditions as well as our technology and digital leadership to drive financial outperformance and margin expansion. We are progressing on our journey to double the size of our digital business between 2021 and 2025, and the trends I have just discussed are reinforcing our confidence in the outcome of our strategy execution. I’ll next describe how we see the rest of the year progressing. After a positive first half, we remain confident in our full-year financial ambitions and have visibility into a significant baseload of activity that reinforces our 2023 full-year forecasts, and our growth ambition beyond. We continue to expect year-on-year revenue growth of more than 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Turning specifically to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid-single digits in the international markets, with all international geographical areas growing sequentially, led by the Middle East and Asia. In contrast, North America revenue will be slightly down. With our focus on the quality of revenue, harnessing operating leverage, and further technology adoption, we expect global operating margins to further expand by more than 50 basis points sequentially. This will result into the highest EBITDA margin we have seen in this cycle. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.72. This represents an increase of $0.09 sequentially and $0.22, or 44%, when compared to the second quarter of last year. We did not record any charges or credits during the current quarter. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $8.1 billion increased 5% sequentially, mostly driven by the international markets led by the Middle East and Asia. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margins increased 154 basis points due to the high quality international revenue, which resulted in strong incremental margins. This performance highlights the underlying earnings potential of our international business, with new technology and high service intensity particularly offshore accelerating margin expansion. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 24.2%. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-on-year. As a reminder, our ambition is for adjusted EBITDA to grow, in percentage terms, in the mid-20s for the full-year of 2023. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA has grown 35%; so we are on track to achieve this goal. Second quarter revenue increased 20% year-on-year as international revenue was up 21%, significantly outpacing North America revenue growth of 14%. The strong international growth was led by the Middle East and Asia and robust offshore activity. Pretax segment operating margins expanded 240 basis points year-on-year with significant margin growth in our core divisions. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $947 million increased 6% sequentially with margins increasing 4 percentage points to 34%. The sequential revenue growth and margin expansion were primarily driven by higher digital sales, following the seasonal low of the first quarter. Year-on-year Digital & Integration revenue decreased 1% and margins declined 6 percentage points due to the absence of exceptional exploration data transfer fees we recorded in the second quarter of last year. Growth in other digital products and services was strong, however, including a more than 60% year-on-year revenue increase in our cloud and edge solutions. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.6 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins improved 248 basis points to 18.6%. These increases were primarily due to strong growth internationally, led by the Middle East and Asia. Year-on-year, revenue grew 23% and margins increased 396 basis points driven by strong growth internationally, both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 3% sequentially, while margins of 21.8% increased 115 basis points driven by strong measurements, fluids and equipment sales activity as well as pricing improvements internationally. Year-on-year revenue grew 25%, while margins expanded 424 basis points with very strong growth across all geographical areas on higher activity and improved pricing. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.3 billion increased 5% sequentially and margins expanded 274 basis points to 12%, representing the highest margin since the formation of the division. The sequential revenue growth was led by the Middle East and Asia, partially offset by the absence of significant project milestones we reached last quarter in Europe and Africa. Year-on-year, revenue increased 22%, while margins expanded 300 basis points driven by higher sales of completions and surface production systems and the easing of supply chain and logistics constraints. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $986 million. This represents a $1.25 billion increase in free cash flow over the same quarter of last year, which is largely due to improved working capital. We expect this performance to continue throughout the rest of the year. As a result, our free cash flow in the second half of the year will be materially higher than the first half. Our net debt reduced approximately $200 million sequentially to $10.1 billion, which is $900 million lower than the same period last year. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $622 million in the second quarter. For the full-year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We continued our stock buyback program and repurchased 4.5 million shares during the quarter for a total purchase price of $213 million. We continue to target to return $2 billion to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are ready to open the floor to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey. Good morning, Olivier, Stephane.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.
Stephane Biguet: Good morning.
James West: So Olivier, we've – especially, you and I and Stephane spent a lot of time together in the last 18 months. Let's – if we go back to Luzern and then to the Analyst Day in New York City and recent events. We've become increasingly, I think all three of us bullish on the cycle and the cycle's duration especially. I wonder if you could comment on the duration aspect you see now as you travel around the world, you meet with your customers, you're talking to your customers, what are they saying about their drilling programs over the next several years? You obviously made some pretty bullish comments around Saudi, but more broadly with your major customers, what are their expectations? And how are they thinking about duration of their upstream spending cycle?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, very good question, James. I think you may have realized that recently, we characterized the cycle as breadth, resilience and durability. And let me comment a little bit further on durability. And there are two or three elements to this. I think, obviously, we did comment on the return of offshore where we were the first to flag it and to call for the return of offshore. And I think we have seen this international offshore resurgence materializing in the last 12 months and accelerating. And in the second half, actually, the offshore rig count will be higher than the land rig count increase. So this momentum is driven by the economics of offshore assets where the FID now – the vast measure of the FID are below $50 and favorably positioned for FID. Also, the geologic and the low carbon nature of most of the assets, accessibility to these resources, and is both oil and gas. So offshore is having a resurgence that is translating into a very significant pipeline of FID, and we see it across not only the IOCs and independents that capturing this opportunity, but also the NOCs that have placed a bet on offshore, as you can see from Brazil to Middle East or the North Sea. So we see this happening at scale. We see also the emergence sort of the second leg of FID and future offshore expansion driven by exploration appraisal. Exploration appraisal is happening in many countries. There are many rounds of licensing rounds happening, a lot of exploration and appraisal is happening to find this next reserve and develop. So offshore is there to stay and not only in 2024 or 2025, but beyond as we can see, and with the second leg materializing. Beyond that, obviously, Middle East has made a significant commitment of capacity expansion both in oil of 4 million barrels or so and in gas for regional consumption, displacing oil for energy or for generating some blue ammonia or blue hydrogen products as well as further expanding the NG exports in Qatar, particularly. So the Middle East capacity expansion is leading to, as we have been quoting a record level of investment from this year onward, and is not set to again stop in 2024 as the vast majority of this capital expansion are towards the second half of the decade 2027 or 2030 for some of the target. So what we have seen lately and the feedback to the visits we have had is that the duration of the cycle as we were characterizing a year-ago is actually extending and is to be believed, prolonging to the right, and with a combination of offshore resurgence being very solid and Middle East being a capacity expansion beyond the next three years.
James West: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then the – maybe a follow-up. As we think about – or as you think about, I guess, revenue quality as we go through this, what looks to be and appears to be and I think we agree on a long duration cycle. You can upgrade your revenue quality either by choosing offshore over onshore or customers by customer. How are you thinking about that quality of the revenue base that you put in place now? And what are the main kind of drivers of that of assuming that you're looking for the highest return and highest margin? But what are the key metrics or key assumptions you have there?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, absolutely. I think we have been initiating the returns focused strategy a few years back. And I think we are getting the characteristics of cycle that's favoring and accelerating our strategy as we get the opportunity to not only get a favorable mix that included a bit more offshore Middle East exploration appraisal, but also higher technology adoption, including digital, including fit technology or including transition technology, all combining to give a premium to the – and a higher revenue quality. But I will not forget also the capital discipline that we have initiated as part of this strategy that is pushing us to high grade to the higher returns, higher margins contract as we move forward, and make sure that we get the best return for the capital we deployed and also to put a clear threshold on capital investment and capital stewardship going forward. So the combination, as I said, of the favorable mix, the technology adoption at scale with some secular trends in digital and the capital discipline that we have used to execute our strategy are allowing us to create the revenue quality improvement and the high grading on every portfolio and every business line we have to drive margin expansion. And we have seen margin expansion increasing, and we will continue to post this as we move forward.
James West: Thanks so much, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James.
Operator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Great. Thank you. Good morning, Olivier. How are you?
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Dave.
David Anderson: So I was curious on the Middle East Asia showed really impressive sequential growth during the quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what drove that. Was that just a reflection of the steady ramp-up of projects in Saudi and other Middle East markets, and also, you mentioned a directional drilling contract in the release. Was that a discrete contract? I know you're starting to see higher pricing on those types of contracts now?
Olivier Le Peuch: Well, I think to be – to stay very broad term, I think, it's Middle East and Asia, and there are several GeoUnits, as we call them, that have been benefiting from very significant growth sequential and year-on-year as we commented, many of them are in the 30% basket – more than 30% basket growth year-on-year in that region that area. But indeed, in the GCC and the Middle East, particularly we are benefiting again, we say from three things. We are benefiting from the capacity expansion programs that have been initiated that have turned into an inflection into reactivity and spend activity that you benefit from considering our market exposure. We have been renewing several contracts and either encroaching or gaining market and strengthening our market position. And you have seen several announcements made. And this includes service capacity, service expansion contracts more than, I would say, integrated contracts. And finally, we have been benefiting from – based on our performance from, I would say, pricing increments based on performance that have all combined service contract expansion, reactivity increase and pricing all combining to result into an incremental revenue year-on-year and sequentially that we believe will be on the continuum for the rest of the year.
David Anderson: Okay. Thank you. And if I could shift over to the D&I segment. Could you provide some color on the non-APS businesses and how they've been trending? I'm particularly interested in the digital solutions business and kind of really what you're seeing in terms of digital adoption of your customers. I'm not sure if you can provide any metrics or any examples, but just kind of curious kind of how some of your customers are using it kind of this year versus a year ago. Is there any way to kind of show us kind of – or kind of explain to us kind of how that digital adoption is trending?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think as we keep saying, I think some of the digital success and digital business growth we are having today is a bit masked in our financial reporting results by the flat or declining. APS year-on-year that we have. So I think you have to look at it first on the financial overall result of this division. Secondly, I would say that as I described in my prepared remarks that there are three trends that we are capturing and that we are exposed to that are happening in the industry, all of them under the secular trend of digital transformation in this industry, one on cloud computing, making the best out of cloud computing, scalable computing and elastic computing access that cloud solutions such as Delfi gives, and enhance accelerating productivity of the asset team from exploration to asset development. We are seeing it. You have seen the announcement of the Petrobras award that is square into that category of using cloud capability to accelerate and enable productivity in the geoscience team and quality of results for the asset development team. So that's one sector. And again, we measure it by either a number of customers' expansion or adoption of users, which we have seen are quoted in my prepared remarks at 60% growth year-on-year. The second aspect is unlocking data, the vast amount of data that our industry manipulates, stores, manages and structured data, unstructured data to try to unlock this and democratize, if you like, AI. So we are fortunate to have a cloud-based solution, Delfi that has AI domain capability embedded into it, and we use it every day to help our customers unlock and get access to this AI capability. We have done at Innovation Factori, 100 solutions deployed. So that's the second engine of digital growth, if you like, is the data structure, data transformation and AI capability. And that's again, we are speaking about growing at above 50% for that subsegment of our digital offering. And last, and maybe the one that has the most growth potential that is untapped across the industry, digital operation. That's everywhere from well construction to producing assets. And that's why we deploy either some element of our cloud offering in drilling automation or in surveillance of assets or we deploy at the edge on the asset at the pump some device, and we call it the Agora Edge solution, which have embedded AI at the edge that do not need to run trips to the cloud to optimize these assets and give – and we use it and consume it in our APS assets to enhance the performance. So we are seeing the benefit of all these at the same time. They're all growing at a different pace, different adoption across the NOCs, the independents, all the IOCs. And it will be a long tail of growth that will clearly have a long durability and we continue to be a factor of secular trend in our industry to extract efficiency, low carbon productivity using this trend. So that's what we see, multiple engines of growth across multiple horizons. And with different technology where we have leadership in most and a footprint that allows us to tap into 1,500 customers for the long run.
Operator: We will go ahead and move on to the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Yes. Good morning, Olivier. My first question is on offshore. You've highlighted how 85% of global offshore FIDs are now underpinned by oil prices at $50 or below which is quite a bit below what we saw in the prior cycle where we thought that you needed, call it, mid-60s oil price to kind of justify offshore developments, particularly deepwater. I was wondering if you can give some thoughts on what is driving, call it, the lower breakevens than we saw prior cycle?
Olivier Le Peuch: I would think there are several aspects to that. One obviously is the progress the industry at large has made in efficiency, integration, technology, performance at large that is getting the curve shifting to the left on drilling the cycle compressing on subsea and the overall development cycle to be more derisked to digital. So technology, integration, performance at large has helped the operator and the service industry to deliver faster and to deliver the lower total cost, the development of those assets. The second element, I would think is that exploration has been creating a portfolio of assets that can then been high-graded. And then the quality of the resource, the high quality of the geological play and lower carbon and better plays that have a better production and recovery potential, have also emerged and have been more favorably primed and/or, I would say, prioritized by our customers. So these customers have choice and they focus on the best and the most advantageous assets and the most advantageous geological basins as we have seen it from Brazil to Guyana, and we are seeing in the Middle East for some of the gas assets as well. So the third, I think, dimension that is, I think, accelerating in our opinion is what is called infrastructure-led development or infrastructure-led exploration and development, which make the returns on incremental oil, incremental gas from existing hubs from an existing platform, lower cost than in the past because the capability to infill tieback and expand from an existing platform, getting a better return on existing infrastructure. Hence, we have seen a significant improvement and significant increase on investment into this infill and tieback and ILX, and it is called infrastructure-led development, infrastructure-led exploration, and that's – this is another trend that is lowering the average cost of FID for increment of oil pool or additional gas. So you combine all of this and you are getting better economics, hence, better and sustained and higher durability for the long-term offshore play.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks for that. And just a follow-up, Olivier, we've been getting a few buy-side questions on the update on your website regarding Russia. I was wondering if you could just expand on what this means on a go-forward basis for SLB.
Olivier Le Peuch: Simply said, I think Russia revenue represented approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue in the second quarter and the decision that we have made last Friday to halt remaining shipments to Russia from all SLB facilities will not impact our financial guidance. So this decision will extend what you have seen as our previous ban on shipments from the locations that we had in the United States, the U.K., EU, Canada, into Russia, and we will continue to ensure that our remaining presence in Russia, meets and exceeds all international sanctions.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: And I apologize, we will go back to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: Yes. D&I margins snap back nicely in 2Q. And in the past, you've talked about D&I as a mid-30s type margin business, at least near term. But in terms of thinking about the second half, can you build off that 34%? Should we expect those to grind higher in 3Q and 4Q? And then more importantly, as we think about 2024 and given all the digital growth you think D&I margins could push into the high 30s, especially with hopefully some of the APS headwinds abating?
Stephane Biguet: Hey, Scott. Stephane here. So yes, you've seen the D&I margins returning to levels we like in the mid-30s after the Q1 seasonal low and just for clarification, this is almost entirely coming from digital because APS ended up somehow and expectedly flat in terms of revenue. So really the entire margin expansion from Q1 to Q2 is digital, which is good news. So can it go up higher than 34%. Yes, potentially, you always have – you can have certain sales like exploration data, et cetera, that come, but the mid-30s is a good goal post for us with a few percentages up and down depending on exceptional sales.
Scott Gruber: And we should still think about that in 2024 as well?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Through 2024 in the trajectory we see in digital is not set to slow down because I think as I explained, multiple dimensions and trends are concurrently shaping the future of our digital success, and I think we expect it to continue well into the – beyond the cycle, as we call it, actually, and the accretive, I would say, contribution of digital will over time, long-term, be more and more accretive on the growth and more and more accretive on the margins.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then just a quick one on North America. Pretty impressive performance in 2Q with revenues up and the rig count – in contrast to the rig count being down. Obviously, Gulf of Mexico is helping you guys. Are you also seeing continued growth in that fit-for-basin strategy? Yes, go ahead.
Olivier Le Peuch: Absolutely. I think that's what we call agility and fit strategy in the land part of the North America has been helping us to shield ourselves from some of the macro trends. I think we believe that the lack of exposure to pressure pumping at scale and the fit-for-basin technology strategy, partly in well construction has allowed us to continue to progress or to buffer some other activity decline and expose us to actually the mix of performance that has been resilient in North America land and then complemented augmented, if I may, by the North America offshore, where we have seen activity and revenue progression.
Scott Gruber: Got it. I appreciate all the color. Let's put it back.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody.
Stephane Biguet: Hey, Kurt.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good afternoon, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: So you guys put up a really impressive free cash flow number in the quarter. You indicated that free cash flow dynamics would obviously improve in the second half of the year. So I'm just kind of curious, though, close to $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter itself. Is this the dynamic now where you can continue to harvest that kind of cash? And is that level of free cash flow is something that you think could be sustainable as you go into the third and fourth quarter of this year?
Stephane Biguet: So look, yes, we are also quite pleased with the free cash flow performance in the second quarter. It's – as I said, it's mostly improved working capital on top of the earnings, of course. And as you know, there is quite some seasonality in our cash flow and working capital. So we came out of a seasonally low Q1 with quite a strong Q2. We again beat a quarterly record on DSO for our second quarter, and our inventory efficiency improved quite a bit as well. So it sets us quite well for the rest of the year. As you said, we always generate quite more cash in the second half. So the $1 billion level is a good starting point for Q3, Q4, and we'll take it from there. But we are slightly ahead of where we wanted to be, and I think we can continue that way for the second half.
Kurt Hallead: All right. That's great. That's fantastic. And my follow-up, so Olivier, a lot of contract awards during the quarter. You discussed the emphasis on long-term visibility on a number of these projects. It's easy for us on the outside to kind of look at what goes on with an offshore driller and look at their contract start date sometime in the future. Maybe a little bit more challenging to kind of connect those dots to how a service company and at what point in time does a service company get slotted in for those projects. So I was just wondering for the benefit of everybody on the call and understanding where your visibility is coming from. At what point in time do you guys think that the Schlumberger get called into an offshore drilling project, for example? And what gives you the conviction and how can you can convey that conviction to the investor base and understanding that this cycle really does is different and has longer legs than what we may have seen in the past?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I think it's a mix. It's a mix of – I think we and you have seen many contracts, some of them have very long duration, more than five years or seven years and recent award that we highlighted in April and this July. And I think it's three to five years is typical contract terms that we have every contract you see, framework contracts that are being used to mobilize resources and to commit capacity across multiple years, and these contracts either start this year or start next year. And they go well beyond 2025 and support the thesis of durability duration beyond mid this decade, and secondly, I would say that you see also that we were announcing a few of the subsea award, and we'll continue to see that in the second half. We quoted our total booking for Production Systems, which is the long cycle side of our business. So you have the contracts, I was referring to service contracts, three, five, seven years, and many of them in Middle East or offshore, as you have seen, and then you have the bookings that then have bookings that are than supporting two or three years of delivery, be it in subsea or bit in some of the large surface contract that you have seen in Qatar, Subsea, as you have seen in different parts of the Americas and – or Turkey. And this is typically two or three years out of booking, and we have been quoting $10 billion to $12 billion for the full-year on Production Systems, and we are confident this represents 1.1 to 1.3 book-to-bill ratio. And this, as we will exit 2023, we'll have this booking to fuel at least two years of growth going forward in our long-cycle business. So you combine these and you get many of the elements of duration on international, Middle East, and offshore markets.
Kurt Hallead: That's great. Really appreciate the color. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: You're welcome.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team.
Olivier Le Peuch: Hi, Neil.
Neil Mehta: Good morning. The first question is just around Production Systems. Margins were really good there. So can you talk about how we should think about the margin trajectory? And also tie that into any commentary you have around the subsea, which has been a source of momentum?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think Production Systems is, as I said, is an equipment mostly product equipment and long cycle and on which we had suffered from some supply logistics constraints last year that we flagged, and we said at the onset as soon as this constraint will be behind us, we'll feel comfortable that the momentum on margin expansion will be matching what we have seen in the other core divisions that we have and this is starting to materialize. Our ambition is not stopping at this margin. Our long-term ambition is to continue to grow and expand in line with the overall core divisions as we believe that operating efficiency, including into this long cycle manufacturing efficiency, and the pricing environment for this unique technology we have from subsea to surface from completion to artificial lift or some process equipment that we are deploying across some offshore FPSO. All of this combines to give us the, I would say, the confidence that this trajectory of margin expansion will not stop here and will continue to grow. You have heard about the booking, I was commenting on this. It's a booking and margin expansion journey for PS going forward.
Neil Mehta: And Olivier, when we saw each other a couple of weeks ago, you had just spent a lot of time on the road visiting a lot of customers in different regions. Wonder if you can just kind of go around the world and talk about customer conversations, obviously, name agnostic, and what are you seeing in terms of different basins in terms of activity?
Olivier Le Peuch: I don't want to be too specific, obviously. I think I will reflect more on the general sentiment. I think the general sentiment is that first and foremost, energy security and capacity expansion still dominate the decision and the economics are seen as very favorable and the outlook of the industry at large is seen as resilient and you have seen it for many majors, reaffirming their 2030 production volume and adjusting their strategy to make sure they maximize the opportunity to either accelerate their gas transition or sustain their oil production. And this will mean investment, and we see that in all the engagement we have. And then the NOCs, be it in the Americas, in Africa, Middle East or Asia, pursuing the two things, either their production enhancement to make sure they continue to lift their production performance, and then addressing security – energy security through their gas development, typically. We see this everywhere, partly in Asia. So the customers are fairly focused on developing their gas assets, expanding and/or reverting some of the trends of declining oil production and to make sure they maximize the cycle, their participation to the cycle and their participation to the international pool – supply pool that is happening. So it's broad. And as I commented during our time together, I think I commented that we are seeing also many newcomers that are expanding into deepwater, into exploration rounds that are across the globe in new territories or in new countries, and this will attract more investment. This will attract, if the geology are right, future FID. So it's, in general, driven by energy security, pool of international supply, and IOCs’ commitment to sustain their position towards the end of the decade.
Neil Mehta: Thank so much.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we go to a question from Luke Lemoine. Please go ahead.
Luke Lemoine: Hey. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Luke Lemoine: Good morning. Olivier, impressive award with a five-year contract with Petrobras for Delfi deployment across the organization, seeing if you can maybe talk about the opportunity for additional contracts with other NOCs or majors for enterprise-wide Delfi and kind of the level of interest there?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. We typically do not speak ahead of any public announcements, the work we are doing on the ground to continue to prepare for further penetration of our existing customers. But yes, there are fairly advanced discussions with several customers to prepare for a transition and adoption of Delfi cloud solution, either for their geoscience workflow or for some of the drilling operations as I was referring to or for some of the adoption of AI and unlocking that data. So we are seeing this. And yes, you will see – you continue to see every quarter a new announcement that will come in the different, the three different dimension and trends that I was highlighting. And you will see large contract in the future, hopefully, materializing as well that will replicate the success we had with Chevron, who was the first very large enterprise deployment that many company are looking to towards and using to reflect some of their future opportunity they have with us. So that's happening at scale and we are pleased with progress. But again, it's a long journey and it's one customer at a time, and it will take years and the cycle will be long and will be accretive for the long run.
Luke Lemoine: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you
Operator: And our next question is from Keith MacKey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Keith MacKey: Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon, everyone.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Keith.
Keith MacKey: Just wanted to first ask on the subsea JV with Subsea 7 and Aker originally expected to close at the end of next month. Can you just remind us of the key benefits of that transaction? Maybe give us an update on where you are in relation to closing. And if you expect any impact to the numbers or the way you might report the numbers in the Production Systems segment going forward, would be helpful.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. First, I think we – what we quoted at the time we announced the JV is that we expected this to close by Q3 this year, which is in two months from now. The progress we have made is that we have progressed towards obtaining the majority of the antitrust regulatory approval to move forward. We have progress in our planning in conjunction with our future partners and we'll be communicating on this as soon as we can to give you the materiality and the timing and the materiality of this as we will consolidate. Now it will be consolidated into the PS and into the revenue going forward at the time we will announce the closing, and we will give you the detailed information about that when it will be announced, and we'll give clarity on the way we will report it. So good progress across the different jurisdiction and good progress, very good progress on the planning to prepare for the closing as well. So we're optimistic towards the near future.
Keith MacKey: Thank you. Appreciate the comments. And one final question for Stephane, just on the buyback. As free cash flow is set to increase in the second half of the year, should we expect any significant deviation from the $200 million-or-so run rate you've set for the first half of the year? Or is that still a good number to put in our models?
Stephane Biguet: Look, the way you have to look at it, Keith, is really on our commitment to return a total of $2 billion to shareholders and it's between dividends and buybacks. So, yes, if you do the math, you will get the average level of buyback in the second quarter – or in the second half, sorry. But yes, it will continue, of course.
Keith MacKey: Perfect. Thanks very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the conference back to the SLB leadership for closing comments.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today’s call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways: First, as our second quarter results clearly demonstrate, our market position, performance differentiation, and technology leadership are fit for the cycle and will continue to drive our financial performance. Second, as upstream investments accelerate in the international and offshore markets, these regions will lead our growth and lay a strong foundation for ongoing outperformance in the years ahead. Third, following a solid first half and with significant visibility into the second half of the year, we reaffirm our confidence in our full-year financial targets. This is a compelling environment for our company, and today we are more returns-focused, disciplined, and efficient than ever before. We could not ask for a better backdrop to execute our commitment to shareholder returns. I remain very confident in our strategy and fully trust the SLB team to continue delivering strong performance for our business. With this, I will conclude today’s call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SLB Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.
ND Maduemezia: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Rio, Brazil, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover three topics. I will begin with an update on our first quarter results; then, I will share our latest view on the macro and our positioning for long-term success; and finally, I will close with our outlook for the second quarter and full year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open for your questions. It has been a great start of the year as we achieved results that set us on a solid footing for our full­year financial ambitions. On a year-on-year basis, our financial and operational results were strong across all geographies and Divisions. Following the remarks that are shared in our earnings release this morning, I would like to emphasize a few key highlights from the quarter. First, we delivered very solid year-on-year growth at a magnitude last seen more than a decade ago. Geographically, year -on-year growth rates in North America and internationally were comparable. More importantly, the rate of change is tilting more in favor of the international markets, where sequentially we experienced the smallest seasonal decline in recent times. Collectively, our Core divisions grew year-on-year by more than 30% and expanded operating margins by more than 300 basis points. We continue to position the core for long term success with significant contract wins and technology innovations that improve efficiency and lower carbon emissions. A great example is EcoShield, a geopolymer based cement-free well-integrity system and one of our latest Transition Technologies launched earlier this quarter. You will find many examples of these contract wins and the performance impact of our new technologies in today's press release. In Digital, we maintained strong growth momentum and also secured more contract wins. At a Division level, the amount of year-on-year revenue growth in Digital was somewhat masked by significantly lower APS revenue due to production interruptions in Ecuador and lower project revenue in the Palliser asset in Canada. Additionally, Digital continues to help us elevate our efficiency and margin performance in the Core, as we deploy these solutions at scale in our global operations. And in New Energy, we continue to make progress across our portfolio, notably with new Carbon Capture and Sequestration activities that raise our involvement to around 30 projects globally. CCS is recognized as one of the fastest-growing opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, and with the tailwinds from the US Inflation Reduction Act and other initiatives around the world, we expect more projects to move forward to final investment decisions in the next few years. Finally, we are delivering on our commitment to increase returns to shareholders. During the quarter, we relaunched our share buyback program, with repurchases totaling more than $200 million worth of shares. I would like to really thank the entire SLB team for their hard work and for delivering yet another successful quarter. Moving to the macro, we maintain a constructive multiyear growth outlook. Through the first quarter, the resilience, breadth, and durability of the upcycle have only become more evident. I would like to take a few minutes to describe these factors. To begin, the underlying demand, investments, and activity during this cycle are resilient, despite short-term economic and demand uncertainties. The combination of energy security, the initiation of long-cycle projects, and OPEC’s policy, sets the conditions for a de-coupling of the activity outlook from short-term uncertainties. Indeed, energy security remains a top priority for most countries, and is driving structural investments that are governed primarily by national interests. The extent of these investments is resulting into a broad-ranging growth outlook, comprised predominantly of resilient long-cycle projects in the Middle East, the international offshore basins, and in gas projects. Collectively, we expect these market segments to reach or exceed more than two-thirds of the total global upstream spend and support a long tail of resilient activity over the next few years. In parallel, the North America market, characterized by higher short-cycle exposure, is also set to benefit from positive demand outlook and supportive commodity pricing. However, this will be impacted by an anticipated activity plateau in the short term, which will subsequently be reflected in production volumes. Moving to the dimensions of breadth and duration, these are also best emphasized by the latest activity outlook for the Middle East and Offshore market segments. Fundamentally, the pivot to both segments as anchors of supply growth is a defining attribute of this cycle. This is providing an unprecedented level of investment visibility and a scale that is setting many records. In the Middle East, the largest ever investment cycle has now commenced. This will support ongoing capacity expansion projects over the next four years, in both oil and gas. Consequently, this year we expect to post our highest revenue ever in the Middle East putting us on track to achieve our multi-year growth aspirations. Simultaneously, we are witnessing further activity expansion in the offshore markets. Offshore activity continues to surprise to the upside, with breadth and a diversity of opportunities across all major basins. In addition, the latest FID projections and industry reports indicate that the offshore sector is set for its highest growth in a decade, with more than $200 billion in new projects through the next two years. This growth will be supported by three layers of activity: First, the resumption of infill and tieback activity in mature basins, which was very visible across Africa in 2022. This will continue to strengthen in multiple geographies from this year onwards. Second, ongoing large development projects in both and oil and gas that are ramping-up and starting to scale. This is evident in Latin America such as in Guyana and Brazil, and in the Middle East such as in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar. And third, the resurgence of exploration and appraisal activity, which is starting to gather strong momentum in existing basins and new frontiers. From West & South Africa to the East Mediterranean, we are starting to see exploration and appraisal at a pace that was unforeseen just a few months ago. Additionally, the activity pipeline continues to elongate with new licensing rounds and new blocks awarded. As a result, we believe that we will continue to witness durable offshore investment for many years to come. Let me spend a couple of minutes highlighting what this means for SLB. As the cycle unfolds, the characteristics I have described continue to align with major strengths in our Core. This will support additional activity intensity for Well Construction; accelerated growth opportunities in Reservoir Performance through the return of Exploration & Appraisal activity; and further long-term growth potential for Production Systems. One such example is the TPAO Sakarya project in the Southern Black Sea offshore Turkey. This project involved all our Core Divisions supporting the development of a challenging subsea gas asset and the simultaneous construction of a gas production facility, demonstrating SLB's unique ability to integrate at scale, from Pore-to-Process. Looking more in-depth, our Production Systems Division is in a unique position as a long-cycle lever of growth for us with quarterly year-on-year results demonstrating our ability to fully harness its potential. We believe momentum is set to continue, benefiting from our strong market presence in the Middle East, and in the Offshore basins. In this Division, we anticipate cumulative bookings in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion in 2023, up significantly from 2022. We have taken a strong step forward towards this ambition with more than $3 billion in bookings in the first quarter, and the outlook supports continued strong bookings through at least 2025. Overall, this will provide durable revenue growth and a significant installed base for services in the years to come. In this context, our exposure to the Deepwater subsea market remains an essential component of our growth opportunity, and we continue to strengthen this part of our portfolio with much success. In Subsea, we have grown 20% over the last two years and are already generating EBITDA margins in the high teens, building on our technology, performance in execution, and the depth of our processing portfolio. We expect strong momentum for this part of our business to be sustained through 2025 and beyond. To conclude, we are in the midst of a unique cycle with qualities that enhance the long-term outlook for our industry-Resilience, Breadth, and Durability-all reinforced by a pivot to the Middle-East, Offshore, Gas, and a return of E&A. We could not ask for a better backdrop to execute our returns-focused strategy. During the early phase of this cycle, led by North America, our results have already demonstrated our ability to capture growth ahead of activity and expand margins visibly beyond pre-pandemic levels. Looking forward, we are positioned to fully harness the International and Offshore momentum that is now underway, and to further our margins expansion journey. In the quarters ahead, we will continue to demonstrate our returns focus, capital discipline, and commitment to shareholder returns. I am truly excited about the outlook for SLB. Next, I would like to comment on our progress over the shorter term. For the full year, our strong first quarter gives us renewed confidence in our financial ambitions for 2023. We are primed for revenue growth and margin expansion through the year, underpinned by a very solid international outlook. In North America, we still expect tangible market growth but at a lower rate than originally anticipated at the start of the year, mainly as a result of ongoing weakness in gas prices. Taken together, we expect the strong international growth to offset any weakness in North America keeping our full year ambitions intact, with year-on-year growth in excess of 15%, which would support adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-twenties. More specific to the second quarter. Directionally, we expect revenue to grow about mid-to-high single digits with operating margins expanding by 50 to 100 basis points driven by a seasonal rebound in the International markets. Growth will be led by the Middle East & Asia Area, and continued momentum in the offshore markets. Building on this, we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA to reach new highs in this cycle, further extending the earnings growth journey we initiated 11quarters ago and taking another positive step towards achieving our full year ambitions. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.63. This represents an increase of $0.29, or 85%, when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the first quarter we recorded a $0.02 gain relating to the sale of all of our remaining shares in Liberty, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.65. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $7.7 billion increased 30% year-on-year as the growth cycle continues to unfold. This represents the highest quarterly year -on-year increase in more than a decade. International revenue was up 29% year-on-year, while North America increased 32%. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 23.1%. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 43% year-on-year. As a reminder, our ambition is for adjusted EBITDA to grow, in percentage terms, in the mid­ 20s for the full year of 2023. The first quarter was certainly a strong start towards achieving this goal. On a sequential basis, revenue decreased 2%, mostly driven by seasonally lower revenue in Asia and Russia as well as lower APS revenue in Ecuador. Russia represented approximately 5% of our consolidated Q1 revenue. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margins declined 178 basis points largely due to seasonality and lower APS revenue. From a year-on-year perspective, margins expanded 298 basis points with significant margin growth in three of our four Divisions. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each Division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $894 million decreased 12% sequentially with margins declining 8 percentage points to 30%. These decreases were primarily due to lower APS project revenue and seasonally lower digital and exploration data licensing sales. The APS revenue decline was mostly a result of a pipeline disruption in Ecuador that temporarily reduced production and lower commodity prices impacting our project in Canada. As a result of these issues, APS revenue declined year-on-year, but this effect was more than offset by strong digital growth, including a more than 50% increase in our cloud and edge solutions. Margins for the Digital & Integration division are expected to improve in Q2 as the pipeline issue in Ecuador has been resolved and as digital sales will increase sequentially in line with the usual seasonal trend. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined 207 basis points to 16.1%. These decreases were primarily due to seasonal activity reductions in Europe and Asia and lower revenue in Russia. Year-on-year, revenue grew 24% and margins increased 291 basis points driven by strong growth internationally, both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion increased 1% sequentially, while margins of 20.6% decreased 44 basis points. However, year-on-year revenue grew 36% while margins expanded 444 basis points with very strong growth across all Areas on higher activity, increased pricing and a favorable technology mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was essentially flat sequentially and margins declined 148 basis points to 9.3% due to seasonality and the activity mix in Europe and Asia. Year-on-year, revenue increased 38%, while margins expanded 217 basis points driven by strong activity across all areas led by Europe, Latin America, and North America. Margins also improved compared to the first quarter of last year as supply chain and logistics constraints continued to ease. Now turning to our liquidity. Our net debt increased approximately $1 billion sequentially to $10.3 billion. During the quarter, we generated $330 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $265 million reflecting the seasonal increase in working capital we typically experience in the first quarter. This largely reflects the payout of our annual employee incentives and the build­up of working capital that will support our anticipated growth throughout the year. Our second quarter free cash flow is expected to be materially higher and to continue to increase into the third and fourth quarters. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $595 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 to $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we monetized our remaining investment in Liberty, which resulted in net proceeds of $137 million. We also spent $244 million, net of cash acquired, on acquisitions and investments in other businesses, the majority of which relates to the Gyrodata acquisition. Finally, we resumed our stock repurchase program and repurchased 4.4 million shares during the quarter for a total purchase price of $230 million. We will continue to repurchase shares in the coming quarters and, as previously announced, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion dollars to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we will open now the floor to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We go to the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Good morning. Olivier, you and Stephane, you outlined kind of an unprecedented, quite frankly, amount of contract awards, amount of visibility into the cycle. And curious, as you talk to your customers now, what you see as the durability of those awards, given the global volatility in economies and things of that nature. How are you thinking about the next several years? How are you guys perceiving kind of the steadiness of these contract awards and their ability to continue to go forward, even if we were to have a recession or something like that? And how that would influence your revenue and results?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, James, thank you. I think indeed, I think we have highlighted and I think in my prepared remarks, I shared the view that in the recent months and certainly in last quarter and I have been traveling in Asia, Middle East and South America. I have seen a customer, I think, taking commitments and being ready to commit to the supply capacity and to the partnership they need to deploy and develop the assets going forward as we believe this cycle is unique through, as we said, element of resilience by the nature of investment at growth rate, including the long-term capacity expansion committed in Middle East, including the large long-cycle elements that are growing in proportion led by offshore deepwater coming back. The breadth, I think everywhere we go, everybody needs - is seeing a customer reaching out to mobilize resource, sometimes for short-cycle production enhancements, most of the time for development commitment of assets and redevelopment expansion from infield to large-scale development. And durability is certainly improving and duration of the cycle, I think, is improving as we see because beyond the Middle East, '27 targets of capital expansion from -- for in the country. Other countries are targeting this towards the end of the decade. And here in the city in Brazil, Brazil has a clear ambition for 4 million barrel by 2030, and I've already committed up to 20 FPSO contract that will continue to build the pipeline of offshore activity subsea in particular going forward. So I'm very positive about the mix, if you like, of short cycle on production enhancements to address the anticipated supply super risk and the commitment -- long commitment from Middle East, from deepwater and offshore operator to complement the long cycle is not to offset and now take precedent over this short cycle and so turn, as we indicated, a turn into the cycle towards international offshore and Middle East in particular. So that's where we are very confident.
James West: Okay. That's perfect, Olivier. And then a follow-up for me. In terms of pricing, international and offshore versus maybe North America, kind of what you're seeing there in terms of the level of concern or maybe not concern but level of willingness to accept pricing increases. It seems to me like customers internationally and offshore more looking at or concerned about availability of service capacity rather than what it actually costs.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think the -- we are seeing pricing tailwinds and we have seen pricing tailwinds in the global market for quite a few quarters and starting in North America. It has turned to international based on two things: first, indeed, securing capacity going forward, giving us -- giving -- considering the tight supply of equipment, unique technology, giving a level of sense of urgency to secure contract and elongating the contract. You have seen example of nine years contract into the announcement we made today. And at the same time, I think performance matters. Performance matters to offshore operator. Performance matters for first gas, first oil. And there's a sense of urgency to accelerate the cycle. This is one of the priorities. And technology integration also makes a difference and is recognized and is driving a pricing premium. So the combination of supply capacity, the combination of, I would say, a sense of urgency for -- and quest for performance integration and technology deployment is driving pricing tailwinds that are serving us very well.
James West: Great. Thanks Oliver.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hi, good morning, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Dave.
David Anderson: So question on kind of the duration of the cycle in your core business. Well Construction is obviously a big part of that. I was hoping maybe you could talk about the pace of well construction that you see in front of you this year? And where you should see the greatest uptick in activity and kind of the greatest shift in technology as well? Noticed that North America was up 9% sequentially, which is a bit of a surprise. But where does that Middle East ramp--up fit in here? And kind of also a similar question to what James meant, question of capacity. If I'm one of your customers, what am I most worried about today? Is it Well Construction? Is that kind of the -- I would have to think that has to be on kind of towards the top of the list. But that -- and if you can sort of help us understand that a little bit. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. No, I think you are correct. I think the supply of high-performance equipment in the Well Construction domain is under stretch today. And I think we are working very closely with our customers to prioritize equipment, price technology application and use integration, use digital to help deliver the performance they expect. So there is a stretch indeed in this. But going forward, I think we are committing the resource when we see the returns to be accretive to our margins and align with our expectation and ambition to continue to expand margins. So where we see the most activity, clearly, this year is an uptick and this will be the case as sequentially next quarter is in Middle East and offshore. A combination of an integrated contract we have in offshore with relatively complex assets on occasion that demands a lot of technology deployments. And the intensity of activity in Middle East, that is a mix of short-cycle and long-cycle development project, this combination is unique and I think will be putting more resource, more equipment, more technology and will drive revenue forward up.
David Anderson: And was the North America uptick, was that more offshore-driven than onshore this quarter?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, it was, indeed, absolutely. I think offshore is not only international, I think offshore is happening in North America. North America as northeast Canada, Alaska offshore and go from Mexico, the combination of which is set to grow and our pace this year, the -- I would say, the U.S. land and North America (NAM) activity. So we are also getting the benefit of our fit for basin success in North America that continues to hold and help us maintain, grow our share and come on a premium on pricing.
David Anderson: And then, Olivier, in the D&I business, APS obviously impacted the performance this quarter. I was wondering maybe you could kind of pull back a little bit and help us understand how the Digital business is performing. I think the goal is at a $3 billion revenue target. Wondering if you can kind of tell us where we are now in terms of that run rate. And in order to hit those targets, I'm just curious, is that about your existing customers using Digital more? Is it adding more apps to DELFI? Is it adding more customers? Is it all of the above? Maybe help us understand a little bit more...
Olivier Le Peuch: All of the above.
David Anderson: Digital. I had a feeling you would say that.
Olivier Le Peuch: Indeed. But I think, indeed, Dave, I think first, in this quarter, obviously, the growth, and we have seen growth rate in Digital that is aligned with our expectations, aligned with our ambition to double revenue from 2021 to 2025. We have seen, as Stephane mentioned, during his prepared remarks that the new technology edge and cloud is growing at more than 50%, continuing on the trajectory that we have set in the last couple of years. And we don't see any sign of this slowing down. And indeed, expansion will come from multiple dimension. Obviously, getting more consumption from the existing customer we have. And we are today deploying one of the largest contractor in Petrobras, where we were and we are meeting with the team here, very satisfied deployment and growing number of users. That's an axis then growing number of applications, and that's where we want to deploy and go beyond geoscience, our petrotechnical suite, if you like, to digital operation, production and digital operation into the drilling domain, automating the full rig well construction process. And again, in Brazil, we are very pleased to meet with Equinor and look after the Peregrinoplatform, we're about to deploy for the first time in the world a full automated top side to bottom assembly, fully automated autonomous digital journey that we'll realize this year. So we have both the geoscience application deployment, the digital operation, and we have new customers coming in, and you have seen some new contracts that we announced this quarter. So we are growing to the pace we are expecting to be our trajectory to double. And in this quarter, this was unfortunately masked fully by the APS setback, but we expect this to resume and to be actually one of the leading growth sequential that you would see in the second quarter.
David Anderson: Fantastic. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Good morning, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Chase.
Chase Mulvehill: So a quick question. I guess coming back to international and just kind of focusing there. We get questions on this international ramp. And because the last six months, we've seen some oil price volatility. We've seen a couple of OPEC+ cuts. And so we kind of get a lot of investor questions if there's been any signs of OPEC slowing down, any kind of planned projects or CapEx plans. So let me just ask you if you've seen any indications of OPEC+ members slowing things down at all in the Middle East.
Olivier Le Peuch: No, we have not seen it. We have not seen any impact of businesses, and we don't believe there will be any we believe that these companies and the national companies are really set and fully focused on mobilizing resource to execute their very ambitious capacity expansion plan. I think you are aware all the commitments. And it's not only UAE and Saudi. This is across many countries in GCC. And I think this is to grow both oil capacity and also gas and commercial and gas across the region. So I think I have -- I've been recently in the Middle East and have not seen any sign of and challenging. And again, the multiplicity of contract awards that were tendered in the last 18 months and most of them multiyear, if not beyond five years, are really indicative of the commitment and the capacity expansion plan that have started. Inflection has happened and you will see this growing for the rest of the year. So we don't foresee any impact.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, awesome. Appreciate the color there. The follow-up is really kind of on CCUS. You had a lot of announcements in your press release, which really highlighted your experience on the sequestration side. But there are other parts, obviously, of the value chain. And are there other parts that you would actually think that would be a good fit for SLB, like possibly the capture technology side?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, absolutely. I think we have indeed a unique right of play into the sequestration that have translated into a significant number of studies and services and modeling and digital that we have provided to a lot of customers. And these customers have approached us to participate, some of them emitters, that are non-oil and gas as you have seen some of the examples we gave in the press release earlier today. And then we are using our technology and innovation capability to explore and to invest into capture technology or to partner as we are partnering with Linde into the application of CCS project across the domain of blue hydrogen and ammonia for decarbonizing the natural gas, ammonia and halogen production. So we are indeed either associating or investing into capture technology, hence broadening our scope beyond sequestration and using our right of play to expand and create a business that will stand on its own in the years to come.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. Awesome. Appreciate the color there. I'll turn it back over. Thanks Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Chase.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Olivier, I wanted to get some insights on what you're seeing within the Subsea segment of Production System. I think you highlighted broadly within Production Systems, $10 billion to $12 billion of backlog growth potential this year or bookings potential. I was wondering if you could maybe characterize SLB's technology offering and integration capabilities relative to your peers as well as provide any update on the strategic transaction that you announced last summer.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Let me take it at the level of Production System first and let me give a quick zoom. So the booking we are talking about is at the Production System level, which is the division encompassing our production system equipment capability from Subsea, as you pointed out, from actually in well completion, in well actually, subsea surface system processing capabilities. So when you put all of this together, you get an end-to-end from port to process, from send phase to processing that is quite unique in integration and delivery capability, hence, the opportunity we have to participate at scale and be a provider with our partner, Subsea 7, into the product of TPAO that you heard about where the first gas to flare was realized yesterday and celebrated by the -- in country. And this is quite unique so that's differentiated. We have end-to-end integration capability. We can design and deploy and develop a gas facility, and we have done this in the past and we can link it to with our partners to our subsea development and participate to the completion architecture. So this end-to-end is quite unique and give us opportunity to participate at a large scale into development. Now very specific to Subsea, I think we are also quite differentiated into the way that we can connect to the subsurface and we have this integration capability from the sub to the completion architecture. And one thing in particular I would like to highlight or two things. First is the electrical capability of transforming this Subsea 3, the subsea control and the subsea and well completion control into electric -- full electric capability. This is a game changer for the deepwater industry, game changer for low carbon and control -- digital control of subsea equipment and control of zone equipment and completion. This is very much again the case in Brazil. We are very fortunate to have established here a unique center of excellence, and we have, under the sponsorship of A&P working with multiple operators that have joined us into a joint development program where we are deploying and we will soon deploy everything from subsidiary to septic valve to flow control valve, fully electric, that would change the game and creating a new step. So that's differentiated. With differential obviously are processing, boosting and processing capability. You remember the award that we got last year into Shell for gas processing subsea equipment into a large installation in -- and you have seen two awards this quarter in Brazil, highlighting our boosting capabilities. So we're unique into that position. And again, ability we have to integrate processing equipment subsea with the rest of equipment well or surface is unique. And that's something that is adding to our digital capability as well. So when it comes to the announced JV, I think we are seeing the process of going to the regulatory bodies in different parts of the world so I cannot comment any further than what we commented earlier. This is an exciting outlook, exciting opportunity. But until close, we'll move forward.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Olivier, my follow-up. You and the Board are in Rio this week. I was wondering if you could characterize on what you're seeing on the ground in terms of the upstream spending picture. And obviously, we've had a regime change recently with the new administration. Are you seeing any potential changes to the fiscal or regulatory regime that could impact spending over the next couple two, three years?
Olivier Le Peuch: If anything, this visit has been outstanding, outstanding for the Board, outstanding for engagement we have customers and clearly highlighting the potential of Brazil to be fulfilling a significant supply growth. In the future, as I said, A&P and Brazil has ambition to reach or exceed 4 billion barrel from 3.3 billion today, I mean, on barrel per day. And they have already laid out the foundation of this of both production enhancement into the basin, the basin or the land basins and accelerating -- continue to accelerate the development of the sub-salt deepwater with up to 20 FPSO already into the play. So I think they also are pushing forward to the next frontier. They are about to explore Ecuador margin that give us another leg, if you like, of Brazil growth in the future beyond the already committed multi-year FPSO contract that are in place. So we don't see any change. If anything, we see an acceleration and extension of the duration of this Brazil outlook. And if I had to highlight one noticeable change that I've seen, a commitment to decarbonize, a commitment to digitalize that I think is the new -- the leadership is recommitted to. We have seen it and you will see it in the future. Digital operation will accelerate in Brazil by the main operator here. And the country will accelerate this commitment to CCS. We are very fortunate to be on the first and only bioenergy CCS project in Latin America with FS Bioenergia. And we met the team two days ago, and they are very pleased the progress we are making on the CCS product in Brazil. So you will see more activity and no slowdown, but any upside -- only upside to the offshore environment and then a low carbon and digital transition accelerating as well.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks for the detailed comments.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, team. First question was around cash flow and working capital specifically was a bigger outflow than we had modeled in the quarter. Does that all reverse over the course of the year and you could talk about some of the moving pieces around that?
Stephane Biguet: Sure, Neil. So yes, it does reverse. As you know, Q1 is always the lowest quarter of the year for free cash flow. As mentioned, we have the typical working capital buildup. Particularly, we have the payout of annual employee incentives. This is a one-off. It was about $500 million in the first quarter. And then we build inventory for anticipated growth, particularly in the Production System division, as we've mentioned. So even though it was -- it remained negative, the free cash flow actually came slightly ahead of our own expectations. Our DSO was the lowest historically for a first quarter so we were quite happy with that. So yes, it will increase in the second quarter and it will accelerate in the second half on higher EBITDA, continuous capital discipline and working capital unwinding. Keeping in mind, we typically generate the majority of our annual cash flow in H2, but it will increase materially in Q2. So when you put it all together, the 2023 full year free cash flow will be significantly higher than last year. And clearly, on the trajectory to deliver the 10% free cash flow margin we committed for the 2021 to 2025 period. And just to close, this will allow us to, as Olivier mentioned and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to return $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and buybacks together.
Neil Mehta: That's really helpful. The follow-up is just the margins at Digital. I think it's hard to isolate because of some of the volatility around APS. Can you give us a sense of how you're seeing the underlying margin trends at the core Digital business? And in Q2, that segment margin progression, I would imagine, strengthens as you work through some of these Ecuador challenges.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. So as a reminder for everyone, I think our Digital & Integration division, I think, comprise and combines digital and exploration data with our Asset Performance Solutions. So at the onset of our digital journey, we have set clear ambition for Digital margin to be highly accretive to SLB, at the same time, to accelerate growth to double our revenue from '21 to '25. We are on that journey and clearly delivering a very accretive margin to SLB. So now we have demonstrated in the last few quarters last year that we -- when we leverage best performance in APS and our differentiated digital offering, we deliver DLM margin visibly in excess of 30%. Now notwithstanding similar setback as we had material setback in APS ambition for D&I as a combination is to continue to deliver highly accretive margins, certainly in the 30s. So going forward, we expect the margins of D&I to sequentially improve based on the very solid revenue growth from Digital and very accretive margin for digital, combined with a return of growth for APS and returning a decent margin for APS. So as a whole, we're expecting to not only revenue increase but margin expand in sequentially and to continue to be accretive -- highly accretive for the rest of the year.
Neil Mehta: All right. Great. Thanks team.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: Good morning. Olivier, you mentioned the resurgence in exploration, which is great to hear for SLB. One concern out there though is the potentially limited number of experienced geologists across the customer base to prosecute the exploration programs just because G&G departments were definitely scaled down during the pandemic. Is this a legitimate constraint on the strength of the exploration cycle? Or is this capability being rebuilt across the industry? What are you seeing on that front?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I will not be overly concerned by this. I think there are two factors that are playing into this. The first at Digital, I think, is having a significant productivity gain for processing, analyzing and generating prospects, as we call it, from -- from modeling, from structural modeling to prospect identification, the seismic data set as well as the capability to process using digital capability has significantly improved. So the ability to create spotlight on the gas line or the oil pools, I think, is better than it's ever been and certainly much better than last cycle. And secondly, I think there is a significant service consulting capability that we participate into that can help complement and provide support to our customers. But I would say, digital, productivity, technology that has improved and give higher accuracy, better geology interpretation capability, better structural modeling from seismic to wireline, and to modeling or to sampling like our ORA [reservoir] samplingtechnology, all combine to give a significant support to the G&G team of our customers and to not a slowdown but actually accelerate and improve the productivity and ability to generate prospects. So I'm not concerned. And I believe that you will see this prospect be fast-tracked from exploration to appraisal to development going forward.
Scott Gruber: That's great. And just how would you compare the strength of this exploration cycle? So those are the path. Is the trajectory trending us back towards that 2011 to 2014 period? Could we possibly get back to the mid-to late 2000s levels just as tieback opportunities are consumed? Just some color on the potential strength of this exploration cycle relative to history would be great.
Olivier Le Peuch: So I think I will contrast it more by saying the type of activity in exploration that is happening. And I think there are a lot of near-field exploration as it is called or backyard exploration that is being used by the most operators that have gained access to critical asset, critical basin or advantaged assets and they want to explore and do near-field exploration across and beyond and use tieback. So there is a lot of exploration happening across every basin, major basin that characterize this and has been -- this trend has been going up. And this trend is certainly different from the greenfield, frontier exploration that characterized maybe the last cycle. However, this cycle, I think, beyond the near-field exploration, we are seeing a return of frontier exploration, driven by energy security, driven by the desire to replace reserves and to secure new gas particularly, and we see it happening across many basins. I mentioned before the equatorial margin as one. You heard about, obviously, continuous exploration, which is almost becoming a near-field exploration across Guyana. But if you go across the Atlantic, you will find a lot of exploration happening in the south part of Africa, gave some huge success for two or three operator into Namibia that are here on the onset of something that could be very significant for the industry in oil development. And then gas in East Med, I think, has been developing, and you heard about the development that we helped fast-track on the Black Sea. That was also gas. So security is incentivizing people to invest and operator to invest into certain regions with access to the demand market and near-field is continuing to grow very well. So in combination, it's different from the past and I will not try to compare the scale but I think the quality of this exploration and the diversity in terms of customers and interval basin is quite unique and is really accelerating this year.
Scott Gruber: I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Roger Read: Yes, thank you. And I imagine good afternoon in Rio. Maybe just to come back to the exploration appraisal kind of question. You mentioned that earlier, slowdown in North America offset or more than offset by what's going on in E&A. So I was just curious what -- and I think you also mentioned it had materially improved in the last couple of months. What you think really has led to this increase in E&A because it's not as if commodity prices weren't good in '22, right? And they haven't been something exceptional thus far in '23. So is it a change in just how your customers are looking at their future inventories? Or is there something else that's helping to drive this improvement?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think the energy security, the supporting commodity price outlook and the desire indeed to go and leverage the cycle to explore and to tie back reserve to the existing advantage basin or to fast-track gas or new oil pools as I described earlier. Now the timing of it, the acceleration, I think, is linked more to the availability of -- and the contracting of deepwater rigs or the contracting of rigs offshore or land on some occasion when it is -- when this exploration is happening. More than yes, but the cycle has started last year of E&A return is accelerating in line to some extent, with the offshore acceleration. And I think it will be part of the mix and will give an opportunity to extend and create a new leg of activity and a new leg of FID in two or three years from now when those exploration will have been appraised and will be FID at that time. So I think it's more -- it's an underlying trend that have started in the last few quarters and have accelerated. And I think that is a more long view that customers are taking and not looking at the short-term uncertainty or short-term commodity price variation and committing on one new basin or committing on expanding near-field exploration. So that's the way we have seen it.
Roger Read: Okay. So maybe just the natural evolution within a cycle, I mean, as things get some duration, you would expect the exploration to pick up. One other question for you, just APS, so obviously, kind of highlighted had some issues. Looking back over the last couple of years, there's been talk of potentially disposing of these assets or at least not investing in them aggressively. I was just curious, it seems like M&A has picked up or at least talk of it within the E&P sector. So more likely, less likely, same to look for a way to exit these assets as you go forward?
Stephane Biguet: So look, Roger, on EPS, we really have to distinguish Ecuador. These are service contracts, tariff-based. There's no intention to exit. And we do need to maintain a minimum level of investment. But rest assured, these projects are highly positive in terms of not only earnings but cash flow. The Canada asset is a bit different. This is a pure equity position. And it's also very accretive in terms of cash flow even at current commodity prices. And as you know, we ran a process on that particular asset last year. We were not satisfied with the offers we received. So at the moment, we are happy with keeping that asset and the cash flow it generates. But if one day, there is an offer at the right price, we'll certainly consider it.
Roger Read: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: So ladies and gentlemen, I think I want to give a close to this call. It's almost to the hour. So to conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the quality of the unfolding upcycle in oil and gas is improving, with unique attributes of resilience, breadth and duration. This is very much evidenced by the strengthening outlook in both Middle East and offshore markets and further reinforced by the tight supply balance as demand forecast approach new highs at year-end. Second, our strong start of the year gives us further confidence in our full year financial ambition. Directionally, the dynamics in international markets will likely offset the moderation of activity growth in North America. In fact, we are witnessing a gradual shift from short-to long-cycle investment and a further transition to international, with both effects closely aligned with our strengths and paving the way for an exciting outlook for years to come. Third, our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio, focused on the most attractive and resilient market segments globally, both in oil and gas and low-carbon solutions. Our divisions continue to align with customers at most priorities on value delivered to performance and integration, with digital transformation and decarbonization as industry mandates. Additionally, pricing continues to trend positively, enabling us to extract more value for our products and services. As a result, we reaffirm our ambition to further expand margins as the cycle unfolds, to grow earnings to new levels in this cycle and to significantly increase returns to shareholders as further demonstrated this quarter. I remain very confident in the alignment of our strategy to formal trends in the energy market and fully trust the SLB team to continue outperforming in this context. Now before I close, I wanted to announce that ND Maduemezia will be moving to a new career opportunity in SLB after remarkable stands in his position as Investor Relations VP for the past three years. Thank you, ND, for the support and positive engagement with our investors and market analysts. Replacing ND is James McDonald, who is transitioning from his previous role as Americas Land Basin President. Welcome, James. With this, I want to close today's call and wish you all the best. Thank you. Good day, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-20 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the SLB Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.
ND Maduemezia: Thank you, Leah. Good morning. And welcome to the SLB fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being hosted from Houston, following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to you, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover our fourth quarter results and follow this with a quick review of our full year 2022 achievements. Then I will share some thoughts on the outlook for the full year. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results and we will open for your questions. To begin, we sustained growth momentum through the fourth quarter, delivering strong revenue growth and further margin expansion, both sequentially and year-over-year. The quarter was characterized by very strong activity growth in the Middle East and offshore and was augmented by robust year-end sales in Digital. Growth was once again broad-based and our operational, commercial and earnings performance was outstanding. We ended the fourth quarter with sequential revenue growth and margin expansion in North America and in all international areas. In the international markets, quarterly revenue topped $6 million for the first time in more than four years. Additionally, our international revenue growth rate has visibly outpaced the international rig count growth since the cycle trough in 2020. Service pricing, new technology and digital adoption all continued to trend positively. Looking broadly over the second half of the year, the pace of growth in North America significantly moderated. At the same time, international accelerated, growing in excess of 20% compared to the first half of the year, almost twice the growth rate of North America. We are clearly witnessing the start of a new phase of -- in the growth cycle, which will increasingly be driven by resilient international growth. This market dynamic led to a lower-than-usual cash flow performance at year-end. However, we further reduced net debt during the quarter and closed the year below our leverage target. Overall, these fourth quarter results helped us surpass our revised full year revenue guidance and we closed with EPS, pre-tax segment operating income and margins all at the highest levels in seven years. Switching to the full year, 2022 was pivotal for our industry and for SLB. It marked the second consecutive year of outperformance for the energy sector, providing further evidence of the multiyear upcycle and investment momentum that is underway. I would like to take a few minutes to reflect on what we achieved. We announced our new brand identity, with sustainability embedded in everything we do and opened a new chapter for the company. This firmly positioned helped SLB to benefit from the underlying macro trends that will shape the future of the energy, Oil & Gas Technology Innovation, Industrial Decarbonization, Digital Transformation and New Energy Systems. We executed consistently for our customers, achieving our best safety and operational integrated performance on record. We advanced our technology leadership and service quality differentiation, leading to more contract awards, higher technology adoption and increased pricing premiums. In our Core Divisions, we expanded pre-tax operating margins by more than 300 basis points. This was led by well construction, which expanded margins by more than 550 basis points. We also launched new products, services and solutions that increase efficiency and lower operational emissions. You have seen many examples of these in today’s press release. Our Fit-for-Basin, Technology Access and Transition Technologies Portfolio have fueled growth and margin expansion in every division and every geographic area throughout the year. And we continue to strengthen our Core portfolio for growth and position for future resilience and returns with the acquisition of Gyrodata and the announced joint venture with Aker Solutions for subsea. In Digital, we had strong growth in Exploration Data, INNOVATION Factori and AI solution sales, and the adoption of our new tech digital platform is accelerating. We ended the year with more than 270 DELFI customers, more than 70% growth in DELFI users and our SaaS revenue more than doubled. These positive undercurrents combined with higher APS revenue, contributed to the Digital & Integration Divisions, expanding pre-tax operating margins by more than 170 basis points. We continue to build adjacent expansion opportunities for our Digital business, both in operations data space and beyond oil and gas, such as carbon management. And in New Energy, we progressed technology development milestones, established new partnerships, particularly in CCS, and made new investments that have created a focused, yet comprehensive portfolio that offers promising growth opportunities for the future. Today, this portfolio comprises five business areas, Carbon Solutions, Hydrogen, Geothermal and Geoenergy, Critical Minerals and Stationary Energy Storage, and we are accelerating our R&D efforts to develop technology solutions that address hard to abate industrial and power generation emissions. As you see, our three engines of growth are on solid footing and are positioned for market success. In sustainability, we reduced our own carbon emissions intensity in Scopes 1 and 2, and we continue to be one of the highest ranked companies in our industry across the four rating agencies. We also made significant advances launching SLB End-to-End Emission Solution or SEES, an industry first to help our oil and gas customers address methane and other greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, for our shareholders, we demonstrated our commitment to superior returns. We increased our dividend by 40% in April 2022, followed by a further 43% increase announced today and resumed our share buyback program this month. These achievements highlight a remarkable year for SLB and speak to how we have successfully leveraged the breadth of our portfolio and our competitive strengths to deliver peer-leading outcomes for our customers and shareholders. We are primed for significant success and look forward to carrying momentum into the year ahead. I would like to extend my thanks to the entire SLB team for delivering an outstanding year. Moving to the macro, we enter 2023 against the backdrop of market fundamentals that remain compelling for both oil and gas and low carbon energy resource. First, despite concerns for potential economic slowdown in certain regions, oil and gas demand growth remains resilient. The IEA forecasts that oil and gas demand will grow by 1.9 million barrels to reach approximately 102 million barrels per day. In parallel, markets will remain tightly supplied with modest production increases offset by the end of SPR release and well productivity declines in certain regions, most notably in North America. Second, there is a greater sense of urgency around energy security. This is resulting in new investment in capacity expansion and diversity of supply. You will see this reflected in the number of new projects sanctioned, gas supply agreements signed and the return of offshore exploration, all at a pace unforeseen just 18 months ago. And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate, driven by significant digital technology advancement in cloud and AI, favorable government policy support in New Energy investments and increased spending on low carbon initiatives by operator globally. Underpinning everything, commodity price remained at supportive levels for durable investment. In North America, spending growth is expected to be more restrained after an exceptionally strong year in 2022. Capital spending growth is expected to increase in the high teens as rig counts potentially approach a plateau. Public companies, particularly the majors, are expected to increase short-cycle spending in key U.S. land basins and drilling activity remain strong to build up well inventory and support target production increase. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where we have a significant presence, we expect the strong spending uplift to continue. Turning to international, markets are poised for strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America geographically, and more broadly, in offshore and in gas. In the Middle East, we expect record levels of upstream investments, with a ramp-up in various capacity expansion projects designed to deliver more gas production and a combined oil increment of 4 million barrels per day through 2030. Offshore activity will continue to strengthen as tiebacks and new development projects mobilize and new FID’s are sanctioned, while Russian activity is expected to contract. Excluding Russia, customers’ capital spending internationally is expected to increase in the mid-teens. The combination of long-cycle oil capacity expansion projects, offshore deepwater resurgence and strong gas development activity will be a key driver for the multiyear duration of this cycle. This outlook is very favorable for SLB with multiple paths of resilient growth in Core, Digital and New Energy. On a full year basis, our ambition is to grow revenue in excess of 15% compared to 2022, supported by the step-up in international and offshore momentum, which will augment growth established in North America. As a result, year-on-year adjusted EBITDA growth will be in the mid-20s driven by further margin expansion. More specifically, in the international markets, we foresee growth in the high-teens, excluding Russia, which is set to decline this year. We expect the highest growth rates to be realized in the Middle East and in offshore markets, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. In North America, we anticipate about 20% growth supported by offshore strength, land drilling activity and higher pricing. Full year margin expansion will be driven by further positive pricing dynamics, increased technology adoption and improvements from our enhanced operating leverage, mainly internationally. Let me share with you how we see this year unfolding. Directionally, during the first quarter, we anticipate a typical pattern of activity, beginning with the combined effect of seasonality and the absence of year-end product and digital sales. Additionally, the first quarter will reflect some impact of year-on-year Russia activity decline. This will be followed by a rebound in the second quarter and further acceleration of growth trajectory in the second half of the year, particularly in the international markets. This typical pattern of activity and the favorable dynamics I described earlier combine to support the ambition we have set for full year growth and margin expansion. In addition, the beneficial impacts of an earlier than expected reopening in China, the easing of inflationary trends and any further restriction on Russian exports could lead to an acceleration of short-cycle activity globally and fast-tracking of FIDs internationally. This could present further upside over the second half of the year. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.71. This represents an increase of $0.08 compared to the third quarter and an increase of $0.30 or 73% when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded a net credit of $0.03, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.74. You can find details of the components of this net credit in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 5% sequentially and 27% year-on-year. All divisions posted sequential revenue growth led by Digital & Integration and Reservoir Performance. From a geographical perspective, North America revenue grew 6% sequentially, while international revenue grew 5%, led by the Middle East. Fourth quarter pre-tax operating margins of 19.8% improved 104 basis points sequentially and 393 basis points year-on-year. Notably, over 70% of our GeoUnits posted their best margins since 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 24.4% was 219 basis points higher than the same quarter of last year, exceeding the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1 billion increased 12% sequentially, with pre-tax operating margins expanding 386 basis points to 37.7%. This growth was driven by year-end exploration data licensing sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Africa. Increased APS project activity in Ecuador and higher digital sales internationally. Reservoir Performance revenue increased 7% sequentially, while margins expanded 146 basis points, primarily due to new projects and activity gains internationally, led by the Middle East and the offshore basins. Well Construction revenue of $3.2 billion, increased 5% sequentially, due to strong activity from new projects and solid pricing improvements internationally, particularly in the Middle East and in Latin America. Margins of 21% declined 50 basis points, as improved profitability from the higher activity in the Middle East and Latin America was more than offset by the onset of seasonal effects in the Northern Hemisphere. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was up 3% sequentially on higher international sales of artificial lift, completions and midstream production systems, partially offset by reduced sales of valves and subsea production systems. Margins improved 32 basis points due to favorable technology and project mix. Now turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $855 million. This performance did not reflect the increase we typically experience in the last quarter of the year as free cash flow was $200 million lower than in the previous quarter. This was due to a combination of the following four factors. First, we experienced extraordinary year-on-year fourth quarter revenue growth of 27%, representing incremental revenue of almost $1.7 billion. Second, our inventory balance increased 22% year-on-year to support our increasing product backlog driven by the sizable share of tender awards we have secured going into 2023. Third, we pulled forward certain investments in CapEx in order to fully seize the continued revenue growth expected in 2023, particularly in our Well Construction and Reservoir Performance divisions. As a result, our capital investments increased $255 million sequentially. Our full year 2022 capital investments were therefore $2.3 billion, as compared to our initial guidance at the beginning of the year of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Despite this increase, the CapEx portion of our capital investments was still at the midpoint of our 5% to 7% of revenue target. Lastly, lower-than-expected year-end accounts receivable collections contributed to reduced free cash flow. As you may recall, we had exceptional cash collections in the fourth quarter of 2021. We did not achieve the same level of year-end collections as last year, and as a result, our DSO in Q4 2022 was approximately five days higher than at the same time last year. However, it is worth noting that our 2022 year-end DSO was the second best we have achieved going back at least two decades. Therefore, this is just a timing issue. Beyond free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the partial monetization of our investment in the Arabian Drilling Company, an onshore and offshore drilling rig company in Saudi Arabia. ADC completed an initial public offering during the fourth quarter and in connection with this IPO, we sold a portion of our interest in the secondary offering that resulted in us receiving net proceeds of $223 million. We currently have a 34% interest in ADC. We also sold an additional portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $218 million of net proceeds during the quarter. We currently have a 5% interest in Liberty. As a result of all of this, we ended the year with net debt of $9.3 billion. This represents an improvement of approximately $400 million sequentially and $1.7 billion compared to the end of 2021. This also represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Consequently, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now down to 1.4. In addition, our gross debt reduced by almost $2 billion during the year. We repaid in the fourth quarter $900 million of debt that matured and repurchased $800 million of notes that were going to come due in 2024 and 2025. As a result of our strong operating results and the net debt reduction, our return on capital employed for 2022 was 13%, representing its highest level since 2014. Now looking ahead to 2023. We expect total capital investments consisting of CapEx and investments in APS and exploration data to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, as compared to $2.3 billion in 2022. Based on this, our capital investments will grow at a slower pace than our expected revenue growth in 2023. As a result and when taking into account our 2023 guidance for EBITDA to increase in the mid-20s when compared to 2022, we are confident that our free cash flow will increase significantly in 2023. Accordingly, we reaffirm our ambition to deliver a minimum average of 10% free cash flow margin through the 2021 to 2025 period. This will allow us to continue increasing returns to shareholders as we leverage both the length and strength of the current growth cycle. Specifically, for 2023, we expect to distribute visibly more than 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders between dividends and stock buybacks. Today, we declared the 44 -- the 43% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share, in line with our announcement at our recent Investor Day event. In addition, we have resumed our share repurchase program this month and are targeting a minimum amount of $200 million for the quarter. For 2023, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready for opening the floor to the questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.
James West: Hey. Good morning, Olivier. Good morning, Stephane. So I guess the first thing I wanted to touch on, Olivier, is the international business had a really strong second half, particularly strong fourth quarter. But from everything I understand and see in the market is, we are really just getting started with ramping activity, particularly in the Middle East, particularly in some of the offshore markets, but we are in the early stages of that and so there should be a further acceleration in international activity. I know you gave some guidance for 2023 in terms of what you are anticipating in terms of revenue and EBITDA. But how would you characterize the next several quarters we will see, of course, the normal seasonality in 1Q, but as we get into kind of 2Q, 3Q of next year, we should see kind of big volume increases, and then of course, price increases on top of that?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Indeed, I think, let me reframe a little bit of the guidance we shared.
James West: Sure.
Olivier Le Peuch: As we see today, the combination of offshore Middle East and broad gas investments internationally will continue to support a very solid growth internationally. We are seeing -- as we have seen in the fourth quarter an uptick into the rate of growth for Middle East and that’s driven by a commitment to oil capacity increase and further gas development. And this, as I commented briefly in my prepared remarks will lead Middle East investment to be on record ever as we anticipated in this year or next year. And as a result, will generate significant pull for our revenue going forward. But I think what I will say is that, what is characterizing international as we see it, is that it has a lot of resilience, because it’s multi-pronged. It moves multiple engines, short and long, oil and gas, offshore and onshore. And I believe that the multiyear commitments for capacity expansion and gas development in Middle East is combining with offshore long-cycle, a return of deepwater, which is the operating environment that will see the most activity increase this year and also the return or the acceleration of exploration and appraisal offshore, which would be one of the defining characteristics of the quarters to come. So when you combine all of this, you are getting a very resilient multi-pronged and multiyear sustained growth pattern for the international market. And I think that’s what we see and it will indeed support not only growth this year, but it will support year growth next year and the years to come and it will be multi-pronged and fairly broad and with multiple geographic impact.
James West: Right. That’s exactly what we are seeing. So excellent there. And then maybe if I could hone in just as a follow-up on the offshore markets, because that’s an area where Schlumberger has or sorry, SLB has an increased market share, it’s also a high technology area of the business. Could you maybe talk through some of the things that are happening in offshore, shallow water plus really the deepwater area and especially what you are seeing in exploration and appraisal, because that’s, as you said, the defining characteristic here and we haven’t seen exploration in, well, a long time, so I’d love to get your thoughts there?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. First, I think, to define, offshore has been, I think, seeing an uptick that started about 18 months ago. We don’t see it abating and we see it continue to steadily grow. I think what is changing this year is that, whereas the shallow water environment was leading the growth to a large extent in the early part of this offshore cycle expansion. We are seeing the deepwater to catch up and including indeed exploration and appraisal activity that is set to visibly outpace international offshore activity actually. So deepwater will be the highest operating environment activity growth in 2023, and as part of it, exploration appraisal will be also outpacing and slowly rebounding. So it’s visible in multiple regions and I think you have seen East Mediterranean with a couple of announcements by two or three major announcements of gas discoveries that are set to be appraised further and then for future development. You have seen some last year announcement in the South Africa and Namibia Basin that also get additional appraisal and future development. And you have seen that the East Atlantic margin and/or Suriname and Guyana remain very hot. And finally, East Asia is also seeing some deepwater gas exploration at the same time. So you have this four or five offshore mostly deepwater areas that are seeing exploration appraisal results of gas and oil, energy -- gas and energy security and oil - pursuit of oil reserve replacements by major and by national -- large national company. So I think this is happening. And this builds on top of the very high shallow water activity that has already rebounded and is set to further accelerate in the Middle East, where be it in Saudi and UAE or in Qatar, we have a combination of oil and gas offshore development plans that are in place. So offshore outlook is strong and is here to stay for years to come.
James West: Very good. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Olivier. So two things really kind of…
Olivier Le Peuch: Hi.
David Anderson: Hey. Good morning. So two things really stood out to me today, I guess, the first was you calling this a distinctive new phase of the cycle, but also really kind of what it means for the duration of the cycle, what I’d like to ask you about. So first, on the Middle East, it’s clearly now taken standard stage. You have talked about a record level of upshoot in spending in the next few years. In a lot of ways, it’s feeling like 2005 again. But I was wondering if you could talk about how this cycle could be different for SLB in this region for the perspective of the types of work you are performing, how are the contracts being tendered differently and really what that means for the pricing opportunity both within discrete services and integrated contracts?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Thank you, Dave. Let me comment first on your remark on durability. I really believe that the cycle that we have entered internationally, that is characterized now by the Middle East joining the growth engine if you like is set to be very durable. I think and the driver of that, as I said, is a combination of four or five countries having committed capacity expansion for oil production for the future and that are much in need as we can see that the tight supply is here to stay and to stretch the market and also for regional gas development and this is happening simultaneously in multiple countries. So this is set to happen and will not last one year. These are long-cycle offshore, onshore, gas, and some of it unconventional, and oil development. So this is first durability is here to stay and we are talking about years. And I think the targets are expanding anywhere from to 2027 to 2030, depending on the country, depending on the ambition they have on sustained capital production. So second is that what is quite unique and this is a combination of offshore, onshore, oil, gas, conventional and unconventional. I think you have the Qatar conventional gas development. It is only set to further increase. You have the unconventional development in Saudi and in UAE, you have the other gas development in the region, including the East Med that has a fundamental potential of East Med gas development. And then you have the mix of offshore, onshore that I think is quite unique, particularly on the rebound on the shallow water increase of activity you have seen. So that is unique and that gives us a unique opportunity to outperform and to use Fit-for-Basin to use our local content, use our customer centricity, and engagement that we have in the region, and to build on those market positions to really benefit and we are poised to certainly have record revenue in Middle East in -- during this cycle and eclipse previous 2014 peak by margin.
David Anderson: And how are the contracts different, before -- last cycle I don’t think we really talked about integrated drilling contracts or kind of LSTK contracts. I think it was mostly discrete services. So is that different today and how does that change sort of your business, I think, is there more opportunity…
Olivier Le Peuch: I think…
David Anderson: … is some more risk there as well?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think that what would characterize this cycle is performance. It’s all about performance. And I think our ability to perform in this integrated contract, and as you have seen, what we have shared during this press release on the Jafurah contract and been able to up our performance to peer some of the North America performance and performance will dictate market allocation -- market share allocation and will dictate technology adoption. So our ability to Fit-for-Basin, our technology like we did in Qatar and other regions and local content like we are doing Saudi and other regions, I think, is giving us opportunity to earn this contract and to use a pricing premium for this technology adoption to deploy Digital and you have seen the announcement we made a few months back with -- in the sustainability platform with Saudi Aramco and more announcements will come. So we are building our future in Middle East on multiple engines, and we are building on the performance in execution. Technology adoption and differentiation and LSTK, while being a part of the landscape of the way we operate is not the largest piece of our business in the Middle East.
David Anderson: Thank you. And just a secondary question -- second question just a follow-up on what James was asking about on the offshore side. Obviously, you feel confident in the duration, we are seeing this kind of shallow water business, which you didn’t really have in the Middle East before. But thinking about the deepwater side, we are seeing rig contracting picking up materially. Petrobras, it seems to be cornering the market on deepwater rigs. So I guess my question is sort of similar to my other question, how is this different this time. Is the customer base changing much from what you see, is it going to be the same big players that we saw the last time and so is that changing much? And I am just sort of thinking that should we be expecting to see a bit more of a pronounced inflection in the second half of the year as deepwater comes on?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think that’s what we are predicting as well. I think, as I have indicated, the deepwater, we see the highest activity uptick compared to shallow and land, because land is being impacted by the activity compression and decline in Russia internationally and hence this is what we anticipate as well and we don’t expect this to stop at the end of the quarter or next year. So this trend is set to continue indeed.
David Anderson: Okay. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So…
Olivier Le Peuch: Hi. Good morning, Chase.
Chase Mulvehill: Good morning. Obviously, you covered a lot of ground on kind of international, the outlook, the multiyear outlook, pricing momentum is starting to build and we touched a little bit on Dave’s question here on offshore. So I kind of want to dig on -- dig into that a little bit more and talk specifically on subsea. We keep hearing a lot of anecdotes out there, some really strong margins that are starting to get booked in backlog. So could you speak to the subsea market, what kind of fundamentals you are seeing out there and I don’t know if you are willing to kind of talk to -- if you think the industry, not necessarily Schlumberger, but if the industry can kind of get back to prior cycle peak margins on the subsea side?
Olivier Le Peuch: I cannot comment on that industry. I think I can comment on what I see as activity outlook and what we see in our backlog and type of activity for subsea. So the undercurrent, if I was to use that terminology for subsea are very strong, because on the outlook, the mid- and long-term outlook, because of this deepwater activity that includes exploration appraisal and future development. FID -- offshore FID for 2023 is set to be the high since 2012, 2013, indicating that there is a pipeline of subsea activity in the horizon and we have seen some of it materializing in our work this year. We are seeing also some infill drilling, tieback activity, which benefited us in recent quarters and we are very reassured that the market is inflecting for further growth. And indeed, the conditions are set for price to be accretive into the margin, into the backlog going forward to build up and to resume some extent previous subsea margin. But I cannot comment on the industry at large, but I believe this is an industry that is very critical to the success of offshore development and where we see a lot of collaboration, engagement, technology development and critical technologies like subsea processing, boosting and trends are positive as we see it. And we are -- as you know, we made a strategic decision to align with -- to form a JV with Aker Solutions and Subsea 7 to address that market opportunity, and that this announcement reflects our view on the market.
Chase Mulvehill: Yeah. Absolutely. All right. And just one follow-up unrelated, if we kind of look at 1Q and just kind of think about the moving pieces, you walked through some of this with international seasonality. I didn’t hear anything kind of explicitly on North America, but I don’t know if you can kind of just step us through 1Q moving pieces between North America and international and maybe some color around margins?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. First, because you pick on it, I think, I’d like to first reflect on North America. North America has been a fantastic success in the last 18 months, 24 months. I think the rate of growth that the team has achieved both in offshore and land market has outpaced the re-growth visibly, the success in our technology offering and fit and tech access model that has been very successful there. I think as we expanded margin, as you have seen, our margin are the very, I would say, different, if not very accretive level today in North America. So this is a very good base to be on. And as the market 2023 unfolds, first there is a little bit of a shift to drilling to rebuild the DUC inventory that will favor us in a month and a couple of quarters to come before the usual plateauing or a moderation of growth in the second half. But we see an increased level of rig activity in North America, and clearly, on the momentum of -- and it’s typically it happens in the early part of the year before it plateaus in the second half and that’s nothing new. That’s a pattern that we expect, hence it will have an impact on the first quarter. And then we see a continuation of the offshore strength and in -- be it in Gulf of Mexico, in east Canada or further North in Alaska and this activity set to continue to grow in 2023. So NAM will be indeed an engine that will support growth in the first half. And by contrast, as I said, the usual pattern of seasonality internationally in the Northern Hemisphere will be offsetting this and we will also this year have the effect of the Russia year-on-year decline that we expect to impact negatively. So you have a mix there that I think we have described and but NAM will be an engine of growth in the second -- the first half.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. All right. Perfect. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Arun.
Arun Jayaram: I wanted to get your thoughts, Olivier, on the level of service intensity that you are seeing, particularly in the Middle East, perhaps, relative to the 2009, 2014 cycle, as well as thoughts on the spare capacity -- OFS capacity in markets like the Middle East and offshore?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think let me reflect first on the indeed, the service intensity. I think the -- again, as I said, I think, there is a significant expansion happening at the same time concurrently and there is a significant focus on performance. So this has led to an increase of service intensity in the contracts where we operate. We are fully participating to this and we are leading on many of them based on our performance. But at the same time, we have much increased and much improved asset efficiency, and hence, we are able to deliver that service intensity, that performance focused delivery to our customer without increasing our CapEx intensity and we remain with our target of 5% to 7% total CapEx, as you have seen in our guidance today. So that’s -- I think that’s one aspect that I think is critical and we use that discipline in our CapEx, that capital to actually to indeed use this to help us extract and guide further up the pricing in the market. So the pricing is driven by, first and foremost, performance. As we see it, our performance gives us a premium, technology, a unique technology that either impacting performance or impacting decarbonization as transition technology or that is fit for the basin. And then, obviously, the stretch in the capacity market that is now being obvious and is being tested in the Middle East and in offshore is driving another undercurrent of pricing positive trends.
Arun Jayaram: Great. And just -- I want to follow up on this -- on performance. How -- Olivier, how are your key, call it, NOC partners differentiated in between performance, and call it, the lowest cost bid in terms of tender awards? Are you seeing more direct awards, but how is this -- how are the tendering process being impacted by this focus on performance?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it has been a significant impact. I think if you look at the Kimberlite survey that has been just published. I think we remained the best performance supplier as indicated by the total survey based on technology, based on the delivery, service quality and operational efficiency that we deliver. I think this is recognized. This is leading to either of two things, I would say, direct awards or -- and ability to negotiate premium on our service pricing or technology pricing to reflect our differentiation performance. So the industry is measured by performance and we believe that we have set the benchmark and we continue to pursue collectively in our organization through technology, through a process in operational efficiency, through digital operation, so that we can extract this performance and offer it to the customer and they recognize it and give you the premium.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. You guys posted some pretty impressive margins in North America last year. Do you think most of the margin benefit overall and the share gain benefit within drilling services from your new strategy has now been captured, does there the market is going to stagnate here onshore for a period. I am just curious about your ability to potentially still deliver exit-to-exit growth onshore in North America or whether the benefits from a share perspective and from a margin perspective that had largely been captured?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. I believe that the market has still room to grow. I believe first from the activity, as I described, albeit I think, it’s very well known that the limited access to the Tier 1 inventory and acreage and the stretch on capacity in the market has created a negative inflection onto the well productivity. But we expect the major, the public to this extent and much less the private to drive the growth this year. In this market, we are well positioned, because we have a technology access model and Fit-for-Basin technology that has in drilling onshore made a performance impact and has been recognized hence has earned a premium. We have a production portfolio -- production system portfolio that is set also through our ESP or frac trees to succeed. So we see further runway both in growth and in margin expansion as the market is still stretched and similar to international market, the market recognizes the opportunity to differentiate to performance, particularly the public company. So our view is that in the North America both land and offshore. There is not only activity-based growth coming this year not to the same magnitude in land market like last year and still support also pricing, considering the stretch and considering the recognized premium on Fit technology and on performance and part and this is true both on land and on offshore environment.
Scott Gruber: Great. No. I appreciate all that color. And then just turning to Russia, you mentioned that Russian activity will be trending lower in 2023. Is that a market comment or does that apply to your activity in the country as well?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. That’s -- I think that’s a market comment directionally and in line with some independent market analysts view. This is five to or single-digit to teens digit decline and we align with this view and I think our market activity will decline accordingly.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
ND Maduemezia: We can take the next call now?
Operator: And it is from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Roger Read: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Roger.
Roger Read: I’d just like -- I’d like to come back to your positive commentary on the increase in the offshore and particularly deepwater. I was just curious to the extent you can share it with us kind of the way to think about the impact on Schlumberger, excuse me, SLB, as we go from kind of a conventional land rig, an international land rig, shallow water and the deepwater, right, like so what’s the sort of multiple of revenues, potential margin expansion as you go across those?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think we have commented this before and we have commented that offshore is an intensity of 5 times revenue intensity per rig and we maintain that view, whether this can expand depending on the intensity, depending on the market mix, depending on the pricing, I think is, I would say, a floor to some extent. But, yes, we see the deepwater accelerating and I think it’s something that is not only in one region, but I think it’s pretty broad. As I commented, it’s Latin America, it’s Africa, it’s East Med and is to some extent also East Asia. Hence, this addition, I mean, we are not talking about necessarily 50 rigs, but one and twos and threes rigs in those regions. And the fact that they are relating to also a content of exploration and appraisal is creating a mix that is favorable in the quarters to come, I would say.
Roger Read: Okay. And then my unrelated follow-up is to come back on the CapEx. Understand 2022 running a little hot and the growth rate a little slower in 2023 based on that accelerated CapEx. But what’s the right way for us to think about CapEx as a percent of revenue, because for a bit, it seemed like kind of 5% to 6% running a little above that in 2022 and by my own calculations maybe still running above that in 2023. So I just wondered if there’s been a change in how you are thinking about it or it just reflects market conditions as we look into 2023 in the middle of the decade?
Stephane Biguet: So, I think, you clearly have to distinguish the CapEx portion, which is directly correlated to the level of activity and the APS investments. So together as we guided, this is a total envelope for 2023 of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Within this, the CapEx portion, as we said, we will continue to target a range of 5% to 7% of revenue. So it allows us to flex it based on activity, but we will not go above this and it will be probably pretty similar to the percentage we saw in 2022.
Roger Read: Okay. Great. So no change in how you are thinking about the investments and how that affects return on capital employed and everything going forward?
Stephane Biguet: No, no, no. Not at all. Still the same target range.
Roger Read: All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Luke Lemoine: Hey. Good morning. You have…
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Luke.
Luke Lemoine: Good morning. You have outlined 2023 international growth and at your investor event kind of give us some parameters around 2025, but then your comments today about international growth could keep going through 2027 and possibly to 2030. I think we are all pretty familiar with Middle East, strong growth offshore as well, growing substantially, but what do you see as some kind of the later cycle growers or is this cycle mainly Middle East and offshore?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think, again, to make sure we are clear on the commentary we have shared. I think I was specific about the later part of the year, the ’27 to 2030 oil capacity and gas development commitments in the Middle East, okay? Offshore, similarly, I think, it’s a typical development and FID that are being blessed and sanctioned this year and years to come, have three years to five years horizon. So combining the, what is expected to be the FID and dollar value in offshore environment in 2023 in the last 10 years with a pipeline is still strong going forward, we indeed expect three years to five years follow through on offshore from today and combining with Middle East, the rest, I think, is more related to short-cycle and it’s difficult to combine. But I think these two major growth engines internationally, I think, have the potential to sustain a very resilient growth of international environment for years to come. Indeed, that’s correct and that’s hypothesis at this point.
Luke Lemoine: Okay. Thanks so much.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: So, Olivier, I wanted to kind of follow up as you kind of laid out your financial targets back from your Analyst Day in November and it looks like you are very much on track to kind of meeting those targets. And I just want to get a sense now as we are kind of entering into 2023, you got -- are you getting a feeling that the market momentum in both international and offshore is even better than you thought it was when you laid out your plans for the Analyst Day in November?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. I think, generally speaking, I think, directionally, I think, the market assumption we took, the macro backdrop we anticipated are roughly the same. I think I will only put two comments. I think first is that the dynamic of this year has, as I commented in my remarks, a little bit of an upside depending on the China economic rebound and opening and that could lead later in the year to upcycle and FID acceleration and that will have an uptick on the year outlook. And secondly, I think, the -- and I think building on the recent visit I had in the Middle East and the engagement I had with a lot of customers there. I think the strength of the -- and commitment to this capacity expansion and to this gas development program, I think, is here to stay and will be resilient to market condition, I would say. So I believe that the duration of the cycle, I think, we limited our guidance to 2025, but it’s obvious -- becoming obvious -- increasing obvious that this cycle will expand and we will have the strength to expand growth beyond ‘25 both on offshore and Middle East growth engine that will materialize.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That’s great color. And then a lot of great information around your core businesses, just kind of curious now what -- if you could give us a brief outlook on what’s happening on the New Energy side?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. I think, New Energy, I am very pleased with the progress. I think we crystallized our strategy very much in the last six months. I think we have been commenting on it extensively during the Capital Market Day to outline the five selected domains in which we are investing in technology. We are investing in partnership, we are investing into equity and critical partners to accelerate our go-to-market, to accelerate our success. So continue to make progress on each of these five domains and we have seen some announcements relating to CCS, which I believe has a lot of momentum and we are involved into dozens of projects this year and we have crystallized and materialized some partnerships, including the partnership with Linde for blue ammonia, blue hydrogen and gas processing and we have been investing in RTI as well for carbon capture. And we continue to make progress and you have seen some announcement on Geoenergy with Celsius, which is a very critical technology that is being assessed and being recognized in Europe as something that could really have an impact as a new technology, as a new domain that could transform a little bit the way the heating and cooling of buildings and cities are done. So we have a great long-term outlook on this and more will come on this. But in general, we are making progress on each of these domains, be it in pilots, be it in early commercial contracts, be it in technology milestones. We will continue to inform you on these milestones so that you can judge the progress and continue to assess the potential and then keep us -- we will keep you informed on our journey towards 2030 and the mission we have to the next decade. So I am still positive and encouraged -- continue be encouraged with what the feedback we are getting for our partners and from our customers.
Kurt Hallead: Sounds great. No. I appreciate the color. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you. Thank you very much. So I believe at this time to conclude.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen…
Olivier Le Peuch: So ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today’s call, I would like to leave you with four key takeaways. First, our 2022 results represent another positive step in our financial and operational performance journey. Financially, we realized broad revenue growth and margin expansion, closed the fourth quarter with year-on-year EBITDA margin expansion ahead of our initial guidance and further reduced net debt. Operationally, the year was transformative, as we executed our strategy across our 3 engines of growth and communicated our new brand purpose and identity. This firmly positions SLB to be the leader in the energy sector across multiple opportunities and time horizons. Second, the macroeconomic environment remains highly supportive of a resilient upcycle in both oil and gas and low carbon energy solutions. This is fundamentally driven by demand growth amidst very tight supply and further boosted by the prioritization of energy security and decarbonization. These market conditions will continue to support steady growth in global oil and gas upstream investment for years to come and will prompt additional investments in low carbon energy solutions for a balanced planet. Third, the oil and gas industry is entering a new phase in the upcycle marked by the inflection in the Middle East and the strengthening of offshore activity. Taken together, this signals the onset of a new growth pattern internationally. These dynamics are closely aligned with our strengths and will enable us to benefit from a favorable pricing environment and further technology adoption. Additionally, we believe that the secular trends in Digital Transformation and decarbonization will only accelerate across all markets, presenting an advantaged position for SLB. Finally, based on our confidence in the strength of the upcycle, our favorable market exposure and strong financial results, we reaffirm our ambition to significantly expand shareholder’s returns in 2023, through a commitment to more than double the returns when compared to 2022 through a combination of increased dividends and share buybacks. I could not be more satisfied with SLBs position at the onset of 2023 and have full confidence in our team’s ability to fully seize the new phase of this upcycle and accelerate our investment for the future. We look forward to once again exceeding your expectations throughout this year. Thank you very much for your time.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-21 09:30:00) =====
UPDATED TRANSCRIPT PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY:
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Nd Maduemezia. Please go ahead.
Ndubuisi Maduemezia: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics, starting with our third quarter results and our latest view of the macro environment. Thereafter, I will conclude with our outlook for the remainder of this year. The second half is developing to be one of the most exciting times for the company in the recent past. We started with solid results led by the international market and we continued to execute at a very high level, delivering another quarter of double-digit revenue growth with earnings per share and EBITDA at the high levels since 2015. In addition to the details captured in our earnings release this morning, I would like to take a moment to reflect on some of the key highlights for the quarter. To start, year-on-year revenue growth accelerated to 28%, the highest growth rate since 2011, more than a decade ago. Internationally, all areas grew and the pace of growth increased to 13% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Activity and revenue trends confirm the onset of another phase in the global growth cycle, one that will be increasingly driven by the international and the offshore markets. Through our breadth and technology integration, we are optimally positioned to benefit strongly from the acceleration of activity that is expected in the quarters and years ahead. In our Core, all Divisions continue to execute very well and the impact of operating leverage and improving net pricing was reflected in our results. All Divisions in our Core posted margin expansion led by Well Construction, our biggest division, which posted over 400 bps sequential improvement. We also held our Digital Forum in Lucerne, Switzerland, bringing together captains of industry in energy and information technology, over 1,000 thought leaders, partners and customers. This year’s forum was our biggest yet and marks an inflection point for digital. Our long-term competitiveness as an industry depends on our ability to effectively harness technology, data and deeper collaboration. During the 3 days of active engagement, it became increasingly clear to all participants that through digital, we enter the future better equipped to deliver higher value in terms of performance and decarbonization. In parallel, we also continued to strengthen our Core portfolio, increasing our opportunity set in the lucrative offshore markets. We announced an agreement to form a joint venture with Aker Solutions and Subsea 7. This agreement will bring together a complementary portfolio of technologies and unmatched integration capabilites to help customers increase production, improve efficiency, and meet their decarbonization goals. In the Core and in Digital, our technologies are increasingly being adopted and are positively impacting our customer performance. We secured several significant multiyear contract wins during the quarter and continue to build a solid pipeline of activity for the future. And finally, in New Energy, we continue to make significant advances building partnerships, investing and developing new capabilities. We announced an agreement with RTI International to accelerate the industrialization and scale-up of innovative non-aqueous solvent CO2 capture technology. We also made an investment in ZEG Power to accelerate the development of technology for clean hydrogen production from natural gas. Both of these are advancing our roadmap for hydrogen and CCUS. Recent policy enactments in the U.S. and Europe are supportive of our selected New Energy domains, technology-led approach and market growth opportunities. We expect to announce additional progress in the coming weeks and months as we continue to position the company for long-term participation across the entire energy value chain. To sum up, we entered the second half of the year with expectations for strong growth momentum and raised our revenue guidance for the full year. This was predicated on a robust international outlook, the strengthening of offshore activity and the broadening impact of service pricing improvements. I am very pleased with the evolution of these dynamics and our execution thus far, both of which continue to result in differentiated operational performance and solid financial results. I would like to thank the entire Schlumberger team for delivering another exceptional quarter. Turning now to the macro, we have strengthened our view in a multi-year up-cycle as we are on the cusp of yet another year of growth. Despite concerns over the slowdown of global growth rates and the potential for recession, the fundamentals for energy as a critical resource remain very constructive. First, in the near-term, a seasonal uptick in demand as winter approaches is pitted against a very intricate supply landscape for both oil and gas through the end of the year. This situation is exacerbated by the ongoing energy crisis in Europe. Looking further out into the horizon, the demand supply picture remains delicate with this imbalance amplified by geopolitics, increased instances of supply disruptions and limited spare global capacity. Second, the growing necessity of energy security and supply-source diversification will also bring – also drive urgent increases in energy investment. A significant step-up in investment is required to create supply redundancies, rebalance markets and rebuild global spare capacity to levels that provide for sustainable economic growth. And third, recent OPEC+ decisions and the extension of its framework for cooperation through 2023 are additional factors that will enable operation – operators to invest with a higher degree of confidence in their commodity price assumptions. Taken together, these dynamics will result in a supply-led upcycle, characterized by resilient upstream investment that is decoupled from near-term demand volatility. We expect investment growth will be durable, reinforced by the long-term demand trajectory, multi-year capacity expansion plans, lower operating breakeven prices and supportive commodity prices. Growth will be simultaneous in North America and in the international markets. This started first in the North America market and we are already witnessing the next phase of growth with an acceleration in pace, in the offshore and international markets that was very visible in the third quarter. In the U.S. land markets, we are participating more profitably in the more accretive and lower capital-intensive market segments, where our technology, performance premiums and our technology access business model are driving solid revenue and margins growth. In the international and offshore markets, we have increased market access and enhanced our participation across the value chain through a combination of portfolio actions, fit-for-basin technology and higher “wallet share” on account of our performance and integration capabilities. The next phase of global market inflection is expected to be driven by increasing activity in the Middle East. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect another quarter of sequential revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion to close the year. Sequential growth will reflect historical seasonal trends. The international markets will be driven by a sequential uptick in the Middle East activity as capacity expansion projects begin to mobilize. Global Offshore activity will continue to strengthen, offset by the approaching seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere, while North American land activity is expected to moderate its growth trend. This combination will result in fourth quarter year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-20s and 200 bps EBITDA margin expansion when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Against this backdrop, we will visibly surpass our previously raised revenue guidance for the full year. This updated outlook will wrap up what is set to be an outstanding year for the company. Looking further ahead, we have increased our conviction on our strategy and the growth opportunities across our three engines: the Core, Digital and New Energy. Constructive oil and gas market fundamentals, energy security and the need to accelerate the energy transition will support increased investments in both clean energy technology development and lower carbon oil and gas production. We have positioned the company to outperform in the long-term with multiple technology led opportunities across the entire energy value chain. These opportunities cover oil and gas, industrial decarbonization and new energy systems, all supported by digital transformation. We are ready to apply our technology, global scale and industrialization capabilities to lead in this energy landscape and deliver outstanding value for customers and shareholders. And finally, we will hold our Investors Conference in New York in a couple of weeks, where I look forward to seeing most of you. During this event, we will articulate our ambition for the future, including our near-term goals for 2023. As part of this year’s Investors Conference, you will also have an immersive opportunity to see and touch some of our exciting new technologies and meet with members of our expanded management team. I am truly excited about this upcoming event. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.63. This represents an increase of $0.13 sequentially and $0.27 when compared to the third quarter of last year. This was the highest quarterly earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, since the fourth quarter of 2015. Overall, our third quarter revenue of $7.5 billion increased 10% sequentially. We witnessed a clear acceleration of growth during the quarter as evidenced by the 28% year-on-year revenue increase. Consistent with our expectations, activity shifted towards the international markets, particularly offshore. As a result, we experienced international sequential revenue growth of 13%, which significantly outpaced North America. Although we experienced volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates across the world, the overall net effect on our revenue was negligible both sequentially and year-on-year. Turning to our profitability, pre-tax segment operating margins expanded 161 basis points sequentially to 18.7% and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 91 basis points to 23.5%. Margins also increased significantly as compared to the third quarter of last year, with pre-tax segment operating margins increasing 320 basis points year-on-year, while adjusted EBITDA margins increased 133 basis points. This significant margin expansion illustrates the benefits of the operating leverage and pricing momentum we have as well as our ability to manage inflationary headwinds. Let me now go through the third quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $900 million decreased $55 million sequentially, while margins were down 586 basis points to 33.9%. The effect of increased digital sales was offset by the absence of $95 million of exploration data transfer fees that we recorded last quarter. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.5 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins improved 209 basis points. These increases were driven by higher intervention and stimulation activity both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.1 billion increased 15% sequentially, driven by strong activity growth both internationally and in North America as well as improved pricing. Margins expanded 403 basis points to 21.5% due to higher offshore activity, a favorable technology mix and solid pricing improvements. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion increased 14% sequentially, primarily driven by higher product deliveries and backlog conversion as supply chain logistics constraints continued to ease. The revenue increase was led by international markets, which grew 17% sequentially. As a result, margins returned to double-digits, increasing sequentially by 142 basis points to 10.4%, their highest level since the third quarter of 2019. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. This performance represents a significant improvement compared to the first half of the year as working capital started to unwind during the quarter despite the sequential revenue growth. Consistent with historical seasonal patterns, we expect this trend to accelerate in the fourth quarter, resulting into free cash flow improving sequentially. During the quarter, we made capital investments of just over $500 million. This amount includes CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data. For the full year of 2022, we are expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.2 billion as we continue to support very strong revenue growth, particularly in our Well Construction and Reservoir Performance divisions. Net debt improved by $1.3 billion during the quarter to end at $9.7 billion. This level of net debt represents a $2.7 billion improvement compared to the same period last year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now down to 1.6x and we expect it to drop even further during the fourth quarter on a combination of higher earnings and improved free cash flow. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. And ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready for the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: Hey, good morning, Olivier and Stephane.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Stephane Biguet: Good morning, James.
James West: So Olivier, I wanted to touch on the biggest business right now, which is your Core and the fact that it’s strengthening so significantly, but it’s also - the core has changed over the last several years. I’d love to hear kind of your thoughts on how the next – maybe not the next quarter, but the next couple of years should play out for the Core business given where the cycle is going, how it’s heading internationally, how it’s heading offshore and how Schlumberger has positioned itself for where the increased capital spending will be?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I think I would like to comment qualitatively on the strength and the power of the Core. First and foremost, I think it’s built on the two critical foundations. One is performance. Performance matters in this industry and performance gives us differentiation. I think here from our technology reliability, from the competency of our people and the way we remote digitally control and monitor operations, we are leading and we are recognized as such in the industry. The second is our customer intimacy. Our customer intimacy coming from the geographical basins and engagement we have that give us opportunity to deliver this fit-for-basin technology that are creating a unique differentiator and creating loyalty with our customers. So I believe these are the foundations. Now the delivery comes from our integration, our technology and our people competency and field operation. When you combine this and we have done that for decades, but I think – and when the market comes with higher revenue intensity in offshore markets and in unique projects where integration matters and technology mix and impact and create value for the customer, we see more adoption of our technology. We see more market share consolidation, and we see and recognize more pricing premium. So we see this trend to continue as the international market, the offshore market, the Middle East is the next leg of growth internationally. And we believe that the adjustment we did in our portfolio, the high grading we did in North America to tune the portfolio to be fit and focused on the capital light and technology differentiation, and this, combined with international footprint and strength we have retained, I think, give us a unique set of benefits as the market continues to unfold going forward.
James West: Okay, great. That’s very helpful, Olivier. And then maybe a follow-up for me on the Digital side of your business, obviously, a successful forum in Lucerne recently. I kind of have my own kind of takeaways, I guess, from the event and the things that were announced during the event, but I’d love to hear kind of your takeaways of the level of success? How you think it went, how you see the adoption playing out of Digital?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it was, obviously, as we said, not only the biggest yet, but the most successful yet, event on the back of multiple factors. The first, the quality and level of the audience that did participate to this on both our strategic partners and our customers that made the effort to attend and engage to the event and all agreed that this event was a defining moment for them and they believe for the industry as it created an inflection point in recognizing the value of digital in performance impact, in decarbonization and in the efficiency going forward for the industry, building as a factor of resiliency and performance for the long-term for the industry. So I think that’s the highest takeaway. Now the other key ability we have is – and we had is that we had a product acknowledgment from the customers that were attending and from customers that were watching while it was happening that – our platform and our ecosystem with the partners we have created around our platform is becoming very mature and is delivering value and has already been improving its worth for many, many customers. So the buzz around the success of the platform and the value from subsurface to surface to remote operation or digital operation has been recognized, and this will call for more success. So I believe we’re at an inflection point in the adoption and we are seeing it through the different contracts, and you have seen some of them that are coming through in the press release, and you will see more coming – in the coming months and quarters that reflect the adoption at scale of our solution and it’s not only subsurface. It’s not only this domain, it’s expanding. And I think the announcement we made with Microsoft to offer an Enterprise Data Solution and the first commercial solution on OSDU is making an impact. Similarly, the announcement we made with Aker on the Cognite data foundation to expand and provide the only subsurface to operation integrated ecosystem for workflows and interoperability is unique. So the adoption is about to scale. And finally, you have seen that we also announced that the power of our platform has attracted the commitments and the collaboration with Saudi Aramco to go beyond upstream and to create a platform for carbon management. So I believe the table is set for success, if I may, going forward, and you will start to see this, this quarter and in the years to come.
James West: Very good. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hi, good morning, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, David.
David Anderson: I want to ask you about service intensity. Something that jumped out in the release to me was you said that international revenue is already exceeding 2019 levels put on a 25% lower rig count. My question is what’s changed so much over the last 3 or 4 years? It seems to be increasing service intensity. I don’t think it’s pricing at least not yet, so is it more technology being used? Is it a reversal of efficiency gains? And where is this most prevalent in your business – is it Well Construction where it’s most prevalent? Just help me understand the service intensity patterns you’re seeing.
Olivier Le Peuch: You’re correct. And I think the – as part of the mix as well, the international has made a comeback ahead of other basins. And you will see the next leg of growth coming from Middle East activity in the coming quarters, but I think that’s one factor. But I think technology to deliver performance, our customers are more focused on critical assets where they want execution, and they want performance enhancements and higher return on their capital, lower cost, higher return, but this translates into higher adoption of field technology, adoption of digital technology and the power of integration. So, when we have the power of integration technology adoption and are increasingly being recognized for performance and some of it through contracts that are performance-based, I think we are gaining recognition and we are, in effect, creating a net increase in the intensity of service, but also a net pricing impact. And I think that pricing has many, many dimensions, it comes from a mix of adoption of technology. It comes from the performance that – for which we are getting commercial contracts recognized and share the value of the performance it creates. And it comes from pricing – catalog pricing, as I would say, the combination of which is creating a net effect that we have been benefiting from. And indeed, particularly in Well Construction, where I think the breadth of capacity we have that is unique across the industry. The track record of benchmark of performance, the competence of our people, the digital operation transformation we did, all have impacted our cost of service delivery for one, have impacted the performance we have created for our customers and as such has created the service intensity that is creating higher earnings.
David Anderson: And then just sticking on the Well Construction business, you also said – and you noted in the release that a lot of the growth so far this year has come out of North America and Latin America. It was interesting that Middle East, Asia has actually lagged. With everything you’re talking about with the Middle East, should we be expecting this trend to kind of reverse next year? Should we expect Well Construction to be sort of the leader – I’m sorry, should Middle East be the leader in Well Construction next year? And you hit another level of margins this quarter, should we expect those margins to continue to go higher as this mix shifts more into the Middle East?
Olivier Le Peuch: That’s a fair hypothesis going forward. I think the Middle East has been lagging the growth and the rebound primarily due to the some of the constraint on the short cycle over the last 18 months due to OPEC+, but I think the four or five countries that have set some new expansion plans have – initiated this expansion plan in the second half and are set to accelerate their expansion plan going forward. I think it includes Saudi, it includes UAE, Kuwait, Iraq and what has been the first to expand, which is Qatar, on the LNG commitment towards 2027 will continue to expand as well. So I think the combination of this will create a new leg of growth next year internationally, and we will be set to benefit from it across all the divisions.
David Anderson: Fantastic. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess maybe follow-up…
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Chase Mulvehill: Good morning, Olivier. A quick follow-up to Dave’s question around pricing or I guess maybe some of your earlier comments around pricing. I’d like to flesh that out a little bit more. And think about kind of international pricing and the potential momentum that this could see this cycle. And me, personally, I think that investors are underestimating the potential pricing momentum that international could see this cycle. I think that people forget what discipline in market consolidation and higher barriers to entry can actually do for pricing. And obviously, international ticks all those boxes. And then we haven’t invested in international, our OFS companies haven’t in almost a decade. So it seems like there is a recipe for rather quickly tightening of fundamentals in a real pricing cycle in international. So I just kind of be curious your thoughts what you’re seeing on pricing and kind of as we look forward over the next couple of years, what are your expectations on fundamental tightness that could drive some real pricing momentum?
Olivier Le Peuch: Well, I think we are seeing this already today. And I think we have pricing impact started, as I said, 2 years ago, 1.5 years ago in North America and has been broadening, has been very visible internationally in the last quarter. So the – all the fundamental elements for - are in place, indeed. First and foremost, I think the capital discipline that we have in our organization is remaining firmly in place. Capital stewardship is clear, to us, and we deploy an asset in the contract and in the market to be accretive to our returns. The service intensity also considering the deployment of more offshore rigs is also increasing the pull on the existing net pool of resource technology that is getting further stretched on the demand of supply in our capacity. And finally, as I said earlier, the performance factor on the base foundation of our operations, be it our Core performance, be it technology that are fit for basin and are creating a performance premium for our customers or digital - operation of digital portfolio that we are rolling out are all creating a performance impact that the customers are looking for. Customers are willing to develop and are keen to develop their assets, provided that we develop them – if we help them develop them efficiently at lower capital intensity and with beating the curve and creating new performance benchmark. And I think this has a price and I think we differentiate in this environment. So we expect the future, indeed, internationally to support this pricing and these market conditions.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. Awesome. I appreciate the color. Unrelated follow-up, if we can kind of go to the subsea business and just kind of maybe a state of the union update, just kind of general market outlook, pricing is starting to move. Maybe I don’t know if there is any updates on kind of where margins – subsea margins are today? And how much margin expansion you might be able to see over the coming year or 2?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, as we commented earlier, and we commented in making of our subsea JV, and we addressed some of this as in previous communication, we are very constructive into the deepwater market going forward. The recent pipeline of FID that has been blessed in recent months, the pipeline that is set in 2023 according to Wood Mack is at $170 billion of FID that will be the highest in the last 10 years since 2011. And the mobilization of projects across the different deepwater basins continues. There are some critical and very positive trends in Brazil, in Norway, Guyana continue to be and that Latin America basin with still some appraisal both from the Columbia gas offshore or the Suriname will be complemented by further activity in Africa and also in Asia. So we are positive on the outlook. The number of trees is growing and has grown visibly to now exceed 300 trees. And these are – this is setting the market condition for supporting higher price and again, linked to performance in life cycle reduction, performance emerging in reservoir recovery using boosting and processing technology that are becoming increasingly critical. And hence, we believe the conditions are set to be positive for the deepwater partly for subsea market.
Chase Mulvehill: Alright. Perfect. Appreciate the color. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Olivier.
Operator: Next, we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Hey, good morning, Olivier. I wanted to – perhaps if you could elaborate a little bit more on Well Construction. Your margins grew 400 basis points sequentially. Maybe you could elaborate on just the drivers of the margin expansion and help put some of the results at Well Construction into historical context with the top line at above $3 billion in terms of 3Q?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it’s a combination where we are obviously extremely pleased with the performance of Well Construction during the last quarter, but not only during the last quarter. I think it has been a division that has been on a journey for the last few years, where we realized that we had the opportunity to put together the best and the biggest portfolio and the most comprehensive breadth of capabilities across the technology portfolio for Well Construction. We adjusted and changed the structure and the organization to combine all of this in one division, less than 3 years ago and about 2 years ago, and we are reaping the benefit from this, both from a technology adoption, from performance in integration, and from customer intimacy, giving us opportunity to expand our market access and expand our success and then critically creating the pricing impact and the earnings impact we want. So part of this, we have fit-for-basin technology that have created a unique performance impact and recognized as such. We have digital operations that we are increasingly using to impact the performance and the accuracy of our well placements and the efficiency of our operations as such, reducing our cost of service delivery. And we continue to introduce, as we said, technology that are making an impact and a difference on the market. So we are positive for the outlook. It’s the biggest division. It has and will continue to lead in the Core going forward. And we remain very, very optimistic about the outcome, and we believe that the customers recognize the performance and look forward using and adopting Well Construction.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Just a follow-up. One of the sources of upside versus our model was the revenue growth in Europe/CIS/Africa. I was wondering if you could help us understand, I think an over 20% increase in sequential revenues, drivers of 3Q and thoughts as we enter into fourth quarter in terms of that broader region?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it’s – it was mostly offshore. It was driven by significant contracts that we have been executing in offshore environment, in Europe, in the Black Sea, in Norway, in Africa, a rebound of operations. I think the mix has been highly favorable, and this is the power of our Core and including Well Construction that has been played out very well. We have many contracts that we have announced, and we have been communicating earlier like the Ormen Lange project. I think we had some progress there. We have our Black Sea deepwater project, and we have more that have been combining to create much impact on Production Systems and Well Construction during the quarter.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.
Olivier Le Peuch: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Good morning team and looking forward to seeing you here in a couple of weeks. I guess we will talk a lot about strategy then, so maybe some tactical questions for you. As you think about fourth quarter considerations, it sounds like margins and top line are going to be improving, but can you just give us any color on how you think about the sequential 3Q to 4Q across business lines as it comes to earnings? And then the follow-up is on working capital. You had made a comment that you expect it to accelerate into the fourth quarter. Any comments there would be great.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think first, I think I have been sharing in my prepared remarks, some guidance that’s comparing the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter of last year with mid-20s revenue growth and 200 bps EBITDA expansion. And I think from the geography of business lines, I would only comment that we see an uptick in Middle East to materialize, and we expect digital to further accelerate and to reflect the year-end sales that we typically have. So, it’s a positive outlook, continued growth, both internationally and in North America and margin expansion to set to continue its very successful journey.
Neil Mehta: And then on working capital, you start to see some of that release come up in this quarter, but just how should we think about that here over the next couple of quarters?
Stephane Biguet: Yes. Neil, as you saw, indeed the working capital improved quite a bit in the third quarter, this is how we predicted and it resulted into strong free cash flow. Going into Q4, you will see this accelerate as we typically see at the end of the year. So, working capital will continue to unwind and free cash flow will continue to increase. We have typically, at the end of the year, higher customer collections. We have the effect of higher product deliveries, reducing inventory. So, this is what we expect.
Neil Mehta: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: I had a question on digital, one aspect that appears to be underappreciated is just the time required to migrate onto the DELFI system. While you get paid for the migration process, I imagine that the margins are definitely better than the deployment phase, so is it accurate to say that after a few years of selling the platform and undertaking the migration process for customers, are you coming upon an inflection point just in terms of getting customers utilizing the system and transitioning to the data consumption phase? Kind of where are we at in that process?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it’s a very good observation. I think we expect indeed that the journey of digital transformation for our customers will take time. And I think it’s a long tail of transformation. We expect that will impact our results for a decade to come, I would say. However, we are indeed observing an inflection point that is reflecting onto the maturity of our platform and to the acceptability of this platform as the most effective platform that the customers have seen in terms of impacting their life cycle reduction, impacting the productivity of their asset team and providing them access to cloud computing resources and to digital operation capability that is not available to them today. So, we are seeing the adoption of our customers. We mentioned in the past that we have a baseline of 1,500 customers that are currently using our digital solution and our previous software suite of products. And we believe that we are today between 200 and 300 of those customers about 20% of these that have already adopted and have started to move and transition onto the platform, and we expect this to accelerate both in number of customers, but also into the expansion these customers are using – the way they are using our platform and expanding the workflows, expanding the scope, indeed, adding the data enterprise solution as a necessity to go and reset and transform their data infrastructure and then adopting workflows from subsurface workflows to operational workflows. So, there are multiple dimensions, complete intensity dimension, workflow dimension and customer – number of customer dimension that we are set to benefit for the years ahead.
Scott Gruber: Great. I appreciate all that color. And then switching gears to the New Energy portfolio and decarbonization. You guys have been active in building out that New Energy portfolio, while at the same time developing solutions and partnerships to help drive decarbonization of the oil and gas industry itself. Olivier, can you just compare the commercial opportunity of the two? I would surmise that the commercial opportunity on the decarbonization front is greater over the next 5 years versus New Energy, but I wanted to hear your perspective?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it’s both. We believe that there is a compelling event and accompanying need and utmost priority for the oil and gas to decarbonize itself. It comes into the engagement we have and the success we are having with energy transition technology portfolio to reduce the carbon footprint or the Scope 1 and 2 of our customers. It comes in bright lights with the portfolio we have created, the SEES portfolio, end-to-end emission management for methane, in particular and getting more traction and more success with this portfolio. So, I believe that this is happening at scale, and our customers are turning into a clear, I would say, initiative – set of initiatives to reduce the oil and - the carbon footprint of their operations and to target a lower carbon oil and lower carbon gas production. So, this is the first trend, and this is happening at scale and this will include CCS opportunities that we are developing as well in parallel. On the side of this, there is a lot happening into the clean energy – and I believe that you have seen some announcement in the IRA. You have seen some announcement in the REPowerEU that are aligned with the domains we have selected, the – be it geoenergy for efficiency, be it critical mineral to lithium, or be it hydrogen with getting credits at large, and obviously, CCS with the 45Q improving to help us address not only the CCS opportunity to - that are close to our oil and gas customers, but also the ones that are close to hard-to-abate sectors. So, I believe that I will not try to contrast both, I will more recognize that both represent huge opportunity of growth, existing customers and with new customers and that we are set to grow and build opportunity on both.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we will go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Roger Read: Yes. Good morning. Congratulations here on the quarter.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Roger Read: Look forward to seeing you all in a couple of weeks. I guess what I wanted to ask is two different things. One, as you look at the margins and obviously, that’s one of the positives here and we compare – I am just going to say EBITDA margins, but you can choose whichever you want. We look back over time, you have gotten back in the right kind of neighborhood here for what we would expect Schlumberger to deliver. If we look at what you are doing in terms of better market expansion, the service intensity you have mentioned, pricing power and the digital. Should it be the kind of situation where we can start thinking about margins getting back over the next several years to levels you have seen when business is truly firing on all cylinders, or is that a little too optimistic here?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we – first, we will look forward to see you at the event in two weeks and indeed comment on this and give you more color. But it’s clear that we are seeing and we are very positive on the outlook, both on the market fundamentals that are in place to support our ambition for growth across the Core, Digital, and New Energy for the reasons mentioned before and discussed during this Q&A. And also, we believe that the investment we have done and the performance we are delivering for customers is giving us indeed the earnings power that will continue to translate into margin expansion going forward. So, this is set, and I think we will comment more and give you more color on our ambition forward.
Roger Read: That’s fair. I know that was kind of a leading question on that, but I thought I would try it. The other one is, and this might be getting a little ahead of what you want to talk about in a couple of weeks, but can you remind us where you want to take the balance sheet in terms of fee? Are you comfortable enough with where your overall debt structure is and where we would think about more of a continuous or somewhat reliable way to think about dividend increases or anything else you would do with free cash?
Stephane Biguet: So Roger, first, we are quite happy with the progress we have made in deleveraging the balance sheet. We have not set a new target – a new leverage target at this stage, but as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see the balance sheet continue to increase. As it relates to the uses of capital, as you saw, we made the first step in increasing returns to shareholders by increasing our dividend by 40%, starting with the July payment. And in the future, as cash flows grow over the cycle, clearly, there will be opportunities to continue improving returns to shareholders. And clearly, as well, we will provide you more details in – on November 3rd in New York.
Roger Read: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question will come from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Luke Lemoine: Hey. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Luke Lemoine: Olivier, maybe to attack Roger’s question just a little different way. I wanted to see if you could touch on this multiyear international cycle how it’s unfolding. And can you talk about how you see that versus 2005 to 2008 when pricing was very strong?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it’s always difficult to compare and make analog between cycles. But I think I will more focus on what is unique about this cycle. I think the conditions are set, and it includes a few critical, I would say, factors that I think - I don’t think can be comparable and will lead to a unique cycle. One, I would say, is the global gas market is uniquely constrained and is structurally imbalanced. And I think this will lead the gas market both offshore, onshore, unconventional and conventional to continue to have a long growth cycle independently of the, I would say, some headwinds on the economic market. Second is offshore. Offshore has indeed started. Offshore, we have conditions from a breakeven price that are with all FID below $60, if not $40, that are set to support a very strong offshore environment for oil and in the gas environment, obviously, and this is very visible both in deepwater and in Middle East. Middle East will have one of the highest growths in offshore environment with more than 30 rigs. We are just contracted in the last six months by Saudi for oil development offshore. And last, I would say that the Middle East is set to have a combination of factors that include the maximum sustained capacity commitments or the enhanced capacity that has been committed by many countries in excess of forming and buying between 2025 and 2030, and we will not be surprised to see this commitment to be accelerated forward so that the Middle East is the swing producer of and expands the capacity. And the result of this because Middle East is also growing in its gas ambition and not only because of the LNG commitment from Qatar to exceed 120 MTPA by 2027, but also because the unconventional and conventional resources are being exploited for domestic and for regional markets. And all that combined, the oil capacity expansion, the gas will result into the largest ever investment cycle in Middle East. And this is starting, and this will be happening in the next 2 years or 3 years. So, 2 years or 3 years, Middle East will benefit from the largest investment cycle that we have seen. So, you have unique characteristics that can and cannot be compared with the past. So, I just want to focus on getting the best of this future market, positioning ourselves using our performance attributes, using our unique technology and preparing the team to participate at scale and being successful for our customers in this environment.
Luke Lemoine: Alright. Thank you very much.
End of Q&A:
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you. So, I believe that this will – we will close this call. So, ladies and gentlemen, I think to conclude, let me summarize with key takeaways that I would like you to remember. Firstly, Q3 results represent another quarter of outstanding execution and financial outperformance in our returns-focused strategy. This was achieved through the combined effects of significant international activity inflection, technology adoption, operating leverage and pricing premiums. These results give us confidence in our ability to deliver upon our promise and exceed our revised guidance for full year 2022. Secondly, we are witnessing a decoupling of upstream investment from uncertainties in the near-term economic outlook. Constructive market fundamentals reinforced by the energy crisis are decisively aligning in support of a multiyear upcycle. Furthermore, the activity mix and investment trends continue to evolve very favorably in alignment with our strengths, both geographically and across the breadth of our portfolio. Finally, the secular trends of digital transformation and decarbonization continue to gain momentum for a higher value and lower carbon future for our industry. Whilst at the same time, the global urgency on climate actions is resulting into an acceleration of clean energy investments. This is creating a unique combination of opportunities we are set to pursue at scale through our three engines of growth: Core, Digital and New Energy. Ladies and gentlemen, I could not be more satisfied with our performance to-date and with our outlook for the full year, to close a sequence of 3 years with remarkable progress against a very challenging backdrop. We are ready to further this success and continue our journey towards a bright future for the company. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-22 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Nd Maduemezia. Please go ahead.
Nd Maduemezia: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being hosted from Paris, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Nd. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics, starting with our second quarter results and our latest view of the macro environment. Thereafter, I will conclude with our outlook for the second half of the year and its compelling attributes, which are very supportive of our raised guidance for the full year. The second quarter was a defining moment in the overall trajectory of the year, with significant growth in revenue, margin expansion and earnings per share. Our execution was solid, and directionally, all trends were positively in our favor. Strong international activity growth and steady drilling momentum in North America, sustained offshore recovery and the broadening impact of improved pricing. We leverage the power of our core, our global footprint and differentiated technology to seize widening industry activity, demonstrating our ability to capture growth in every land and offshore basin from North America to most remote international basin. This was reflected in the broad dimension of growth in our second quarter results as customers stepped up activity with a focus on increased performance and production. Overall, we effectively harness these positive dynamics and delivery very strong second short quarter revenue and earnings growth. In addition to the details provided in our earnings press release this morning, let me reiterate some performance highlights from the quarter. We recorded 14% revenue increase, the largest sequential revenue increase in more than a decade, as revenue growth exceeded rig count increase, both internationally and in North America. Year-on-year revenue growth accelerated to 20%, further sustaining robust growth momentum with a visible inflection in international markets at 50% growth over same period last year. Growth was very broad across all dimensions: area, divisions, land and offshore, with spending visibly higher across all customer types. Internationally, sequential growth was recorded in all of our Middle East and Asia units and all of Latin America and ECA growth was pervasive across Europe, Scandinavia and West Africa. In North America, we continue to post very solid growth offshore and onshore and on increased drilling and completions activity. The rise of offshore activity, particularly deepwater, was a key driver for our second quarter sequential growth in most regions and in support of all divisions. Globally, all four divisions posted double-digit revenue growth and expanded margins sequentially, resulting in the highest quarterly operating margins level since 2015. In addition, another feature of the quarter was broadening pricing improvement, impacting all divisions, geographies and operating environment. Finally, the quarter also marked a number of new contract wins and an increase in backlog for production systems and our re-equipment business, another leading indicator of the strength of activity pipeline ahead of us. Notably, price improvement is also being reflected in production system backlog, which is significant for its later cycle implication for sustained margins expansion on an overall portfolio basis. To sum up, the second quarter emphasizes our clearly differentiated operational performance, strategic execution and financial results, both in North America and internationally. We have very strong momentum and have secured a solid pipeline of activity ahead of us. I am very proud of the entire Schlumberger team for delivering these exceptional results and demonstrating our unique value proposition for both our customers and our shareholders. Turning now to the macro, first, energy security and urgency to establish more diverse and reliable source of oil and gas supply has become increasingly apparent through the year, exacerbated by the effect of ongoing conflict in Ukraine and a notable increase in periodic supply disruptions in certain regions. Second, supply and excess spare capacity remains very tight as recent OPEC and IEA demand outlooks for ‘22 and ‘23 remain constructive, continuing to suggest a call on supply from North America and a more significant call on supply from the international basins. Third, despite near-term concern of a global economic slowdown, the combination of energy security, favorable breakeven price and urgency to grow long-term oil and gas production capacity will continue to support strong upstream E&P spending growth. Consequently, we are witnessing a decoupling of upstream spending from potential near-term demand volatility, resulting in resilient global oil and gas activity growth in 2022 and beyond. Additionally, the factors supporting pricing tailwinds, more specifically the tightening service supply capacity, both in NAM, and increasingly, in international markets, will continue to operate on the defining characteristics of this up-cycle and will support both revenue growth and margin expansion, more than offsetting inflation. Looking more specifically at the second half of the year, we see very robust activity dynamics characterized by distinct acceleration of investments in the international basins and the continued strengthening of offshore activity as all operators, including IOCs, step-up spending. The energy security situation continues to drive structural activity increase, resulting from the increased focus on short-term production and the mid to long-term capacity expansion across oil and gas plays. In addition, we also expect further exploration and appraisal activity and the pricing dynamics experience so far to add further support to both the growth trajectory and the margins performance during the second half. This positive undercurrent will lead to an attractive mix and an increase in short and long-cycle international projects, complementing already robust short cycle activity in North America. Directionally, during the second half of the year, we expect a strong continuation of growth in the core led by production systems for the rest of the year with Digital & Integration benefiting from typically seasonally strong year end sales. Also and as a result of the rotation of investment towards international basins, we anticipate our highest growth rate during the second half to occur internationally, setting up a very nice backdrop for 2023 by outlook. Based on this, we expect our H2 revenue this year to grow at least high-teens compared to the same period last year. Full year revenue growth will therefore be in the high-teens, consisting revenue of at least $27 billion for 2022. Furthermore, our adjusted EBITDA, in absolute dollar terms, will increase by at least 25% for the full year of 2022 when compared to 2021. Indeed, 2022 is stepping up to be an outstanding year for Schlumberger. The power of our core, our digital and decarbonization leadership and the expensive attribute of this upcycle enabled us to leverage focused North America business with an unparalleled international breadth. The combination of which favorably exposed Schlumberger to durable top line growth, earnings and further margin expansion potential that is unmatched in the sector. Beyond this, the momentum we are building through the second half of the year and the exit rates that we will have achieved bode very well for our 2023 outlook and financial ambition, both of which we will share in more details at our investor conference in November. I look forward to seeing many of you in person at this event. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.50. This represents an increase of $0.16 sequentially and $0.20 when compared to the second quarter of last year. This also represented the highest quarterly earnings per share since the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, during the first quarter, we recorded a $0.14 gain relating to the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty Energy and a $0.03 gain relating to the sale of certain real estate, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.67. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $6.8 billion increased 14% sequentially. This represented the strongest sequential quarterly growth since 2010. All four divisions experienced double-digit increases. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had virtually no impact on the sequential revenue increase. Pre-tax operating margins expanded 212 basis points sequentially to 17.1% and EBITDA margins increased 157 basis points to 22.6%. These increases largely reflect the seasonal rebound in activity, a favorable technology mix, particularly on higher offshore activities and strong exploration data licensing sales in our digital and integration division. Margins also increased significantly as compared to the second quarter of last year. Pre-tax segment operating margins increased 279 basis points year-on-year, while adjusted EBITDA margins increased 133 basis points year-on-year. This margin performance is even more notable considering the inflationary headwinds we continue to face. This demonstrates our ability to manage inflation through our supply chain organization as well as through pricing adjustments from our customers. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $955 million increased 11% sequentially, with margins increasing 570 basis points to 39.7%. These increases were primarily due to higher exploration data licensing sales, including $95 million of transfer fees. Reservoir performance revenue of $1.3 billion increased 10% sequentially, beyond the impact of the seasonal rebound in activity, driven by growth both on land and offshore. Margins improved 143 basis points to 14.6%, primarily as a result of the seasonal recovery and higher offshore and exploration activity. Well Construction revenue of $2.7 million increased 12%, driven by strong growth and improved pricing both internationally and in North America. Margins increased 134 basis points to 17.5% due to the higher activity, combined with a favorable technology mix and improved pricing. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.9 billion increased 18% sequentially and margins increased 190 basis points to 9%. Global supply chain and logistics constraints started to abate, resulting in higher product deliveries and backlog conversion. International growth outpaced North America growth and was particularly strong in the Europe/CIS/Africa area. Now turning to our liquidity, during the quarter, we generated €408 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $119 million. Working capital consumed $936 million of cash during the quarter, largely driven by higher receivables due to the significant revenue growth. However, our DSO improved sequentially. Inventory also increased as we continue to manage lead times in anticipation of continuous growth in the second half of the year, particularly in our Production Systems division. Consistent with our historical trends, we expect our working capital and cash flow generation to significantly improve over the second half of the year. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $527 million. This amount includes CapEx and investments in APS projects and seismic exploration data. Although it is reflected outside the free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $430 million of net proceeds. We currently hold a 12% interest in Liberty. During the quarter, we also sold certain real estate, which resulted in proceeds of $120 million. As a result, our net debt improved by $406 million during the quarter to $11 billion. This level of net debt represented a $2 billion improvement compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, we have now achieved our previously stated leverage target of 2x net debt-to-EBITDA. We expect our leverage to continue decreasing throughout the rest of the year on a combination of higher earnings and improved free cash flow, allowing us to further strengthen our balance sheet. This will provide us with the financial flexibility required to continue funding growth and increased returns to shareholders throughout the cycle. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are opening the floor to the questions.
Operator: Very good. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning, Olivier and Stephane.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.
James West: So Olivier, curious how you are thinking about the evolution of the – particularly international cycle as we go through the next several quarters and really into next year? I mean we are clearly – OFS or energy is decoupling from the global economy, you are going to see some changes in probably activity levels, the mix, the pricing. It seems to me the kind of the best is still to come, I think, for the cycle. So, just kind of curious of your broad outlook for international?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, first, I want to reinforce that the macro environment we are facing is quite unique. It’s a confluence and unprecedented low spare capacity, 8 years of underinvestment in international basins and a call for energy security that is creating a double sourcing of both oil and gas parts of the international basins. So, when you put that together, it trades not only a short cycle impulse on production enhancements to respond to that energy security, but also reinforce the need for expanding oil capacity, accelerating gas development and the entire set of international basis both offshore and onshore benefit from it, right, as we see. So, we have seen an inflection in the sentiment of our customers, both our national company, international oil company and international independent, to respond to that call and turning and accelerating the investments and rotating their investment internationally visibly. So, this is certainly a multi-leg, I will call it, multi-phase, both oil and gas positive environment forward. So, we have seen that Latin America has been the first to benefit from that inflection and we see that continuing going forward as from Guyana to Brazil to Colombia as a short cycle to Argentina as a shale exposed environment. We foresee this to be continuing, including exploration offshore Colombia, our Atlantic margin in Brazil this is set to continue going forward. We are seeing this to rotate in ECA, as you may have seen, more than offsetting the constraints we have in Russia-Ukraine region and creating a superb undercurrent, as I like to call it and all offshore basins in this region. And we have seen it in very strong in Europe, West Africa and Scandinavia with the unique tax incentive set that will start to be kicking in next year will only accelerate that trend, and East Mediterranean or Black Sea will also see continuous growth going forward. So – and you turn to Middle East and Asia. I think you have a combination of oil capacity commitment increase by both UAE, Saudi, and to a certain extent, Kuwait, that will play out. And well, in the case of KSA, create an uptick in offshore activity partly from next year. You see that the gas that is being developed at large scale in Middle East, both for domestic and for fuel substitution, that will continue to play to our strength in Qatar and commercial in both UAE and Saudi, Oman. And then you have the Asia market. That is also not shy of investments, and you see that long-term into the South China Sea as well. So I think it’s multi-branch, multi-color, I would say, and it has started strong in line, and we will turn to your further ECA, further Middle East with inflection have been materialized as the quarter executed going forward.
James West: Okay. Okay, got it. That’s very helpful, Oliver. Maybe a quick follow-up from me, you have your digital event coming up here in September. I’ve been following kind of the list of speakers, very impressive group that you’re assembling. And I’m curious where you see the industry now, where you see Schlumberger in the industry and the digitalization or the digital journey of the industry? It seems to be that we’re – we’ve been selecting what we seem to be inflecting even further in digital, and certainly, the results are proving that out in your income statement as well. So curious about digital.
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I think you are correct. And I think the number and the rich panels that we are assembling into this digital forum in September, is there for the reason. First and foremost is because the industry believes in digital, that digital can add a significant step-up in efficiency that will continue to impact positively cost cash generation and will contribute to decarbonization of operations. So that’s the reason why we are seeing customer coming in the high number and record number to our digital form. And the second reason we have this success is our thought leadership and platform strategy that has been adopted and that has been the cornerstone of our success in digital, and we are using it to continue to transition all of our customer base towards this cloud platform. And this is a long tail, and this will certainly last all this decade and beyond, and we are looking forward to success, long success here. But also, we are using this platform and the digital capability to continue to enhance our operation, to continue to transform our digital operations, to impact our customers and our operations for efficiency and for performance. So, lifting up through efficiency, lifting up the performance and hence getting a premium or getting an increment of market position. So, it has a dual effect. But the success of digital form is certainly the credit to our team, but also the proof that digital is now mainstream into this industry.
James West: Got it. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hey, good morning, Olivier. So going across your numbers, you grew in every region in every segment. But the one I thought was really interesting was MENA. It grew 7% this quarter, but it didn’t even – in the Middle East, it hasn’t even started yet. So I was wondering if you could just kind of start there and just help us give us a sense of kind of where you stand today in terms of project mobilization and how that region is building out? And I’m just kind of curious when do you fully expect to be up and running on the contracts you have in hand? And I guess related to that, it’s been a while since we’ve seen a ramp-up in activity over there. But we’ve often seen start-up delays and higher costs that lead up to the work. So aside from just pure execution, are there ways that you can navigate some of these risks? Are there lessons learned from past cycles? Or is it different because this is much more integrated drilling work that didn’t exist in prior cycles?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. I think I believe that our team has improved its execution track record. We have, as you may remember, 3 years ago, we took some action on to our underperforming contracts. And we learned and applied some best practice, best lessons and project management to technology deployment and to the discipline in our competency management deployment and use of digital to help us execute this contract in a better way. And from the way we manage the maintenance cycle of our equipment to the way we deploy and do remote operation to control and help and support people on the ground, I think we have progressed a lot in the last few years. And as such, the major contract we are starting always has – have a learning period. But I think we are accelerating this learning period by contrast to previous cycle. And I think we are set for success on all this project before soon. And – but we always have somewhere, somehow, in international basin, in a major project start-up. And – but we expect this to be, I would say, the background that we will have going forward, but our execution, practical lesson learned, use of digital, best practice and disciplined organization, including our competency that we deploy, has helped us to accelerate the lesson learned and to reach maturity in terms of performance, margins on those projects faster than the income second. So I’m positive. And as I said, there is an inflection building up in Middle East activity that will materialize in two or three countries visibly into the second half, and will accelerate next year as we will see more offshore shallow activity partially into the VCC environment in Middle East led by the Saudi oil major development that they are accelerating for oil capacity increase towards their 2027 1 million barrel. This will translate into activity. So further activity increase will materialize, and we will benefit from it. The industry will certainly have a large ramp-up going forward. So it’s the early cycle of growth in Middle East.
David Anderson: The offshore market was actually my second question there. You’re – the really – the offshore markets are really tailor-made for your technology profile. Exploration, drilling, subsea boosting, so – and recognizing on that, there is a ramp-up on the shallow water side and the jackups in the Middle East. Is it too soon to say an overall kind of offshore inflection is here? We noticed a lot of your – Yes. We saw a lot of your oil offshore, Gulf of Mexico, if not too soon? Okay.
Olivier Le Peuch: No, it’s not too soon. In the second quarter, international, offshore was accretive to our growth, International, visibly, and you can see it into the ECA growth. And I think if you read some of the reports published by and others, I think you see that – you see that the outlook for 2022, 2025 on offshore investments and FID activity will outpace visibly at 2016-2019 cycle. So we have early innings of this offshore cycle, but it’s quite interesting. And it includes more exposure or more appraisal activity than we could have anticipated considering the – some of the macro, but we are seeing it from Namibia to Colombia to Asia. We are seeing interesting exploration happening to north of Brazil in the Atlantic Margin. We are seeing acceleration of appraisal and exploration that combined and increase the beneficiary mix, I would say, that we are seeing in offshore environment. So yes, we are very, very close, as we recently commented doing a conference in June. We were – we believe that the average revenue intensity that we collect from an offshore environment is – can be up to 5x or more what we collect in the land environment. And the scope that we have is quite unique from, as you said, from subsea to exploration, from data licensing to integrated rig and well construction. So it’s quite unique, and we will benefit increasingly on that offshore outlook.
David Anderson: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, David.
Operator: Our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Hi, good morning. Good afternoon, over in Europe. I guess I want to come back to the topic on international, and maybe follow-up a little bit on James’ question. Obviously, we’ve now seen kind of three of the diversified service companies, international results. I mean, they have all surprised to the upside, so it feels like that activity may be a little bit higher than kind of what we all thought kind of heading into 2Q. But could you talk about the fundamental tightness that you’re seeing across the international market, and whether you’re seeing kind of broad-based pricing at this point or is it just kind of more pockets of pricing increases? So just a little bit on pricing across the international side?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, it’s definitively broadening. As activity continues to ramp up and includes an offshore mix that typically has more pull on equipment, considering the backup and considering the length of assignment of this equipment on offshore rigs, this is creating a pinch on the supply capacity that result into a bowling pricing pressure and pricing uplift that we are seeing in all environments, I would say. Both from existing contracts where we have the opportunity to negotiate and offset more than offset inflation as a new tender and/or direct award where customers want to secure future capacity, the want to secure technology. They want to secure performance, and as such, are accepting directly negotiating pricing increments on existing scope. So we are benefiting from this. The pricing environment is definitely broadening and improving. And we believe that going forward, as we see the inflection of international investment that have started to accelerate in the second half as we anticipate second half international rate of growth will outpace the North America rate of growth, we see that to generate more floor and uplift for the pricing environment going forward.
Chase Mulvehill: Yes, all makes sense, and we agree with you there. Can we – as a kind of a related follow-up, can you expand on kind of, I guess, maybe your ultimate earnings power of the company? Obviously, you gave us some EBITDA guidance here. And when we think about the earnings for this year, you’ll surpass last cycle’s peak. But how should we be framing kind of the earnings power of Schlumberger this cycle? And then maybe just kind of weave in the discussion around EBITDA margins and your confidence in maybe hitting the 25% mid-cycle margins that you had kind of guided as a target for kind of year-end ‘23, do you think you can kind of hit that a little bit earlier now, given that you’re outperforming on the margin side?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. I think as we have said before, I think there are two, three reasons why we are confident about our margin trajectory earnings power going forward. First is that we had a high grade in our portfolio in North America that’s lifted our margin in North America to deliver that we are comfortable now, that we are competing and accretive. Secondly, we have created a significant reset in our operating leverage less than 2 years ago that is paying up and paying off at the time we are expanding and growing. And third, we believe that a combination of a tight supply already very visible in North America and broadening, as I said, in international, combined with performance, technology performance, integration performance differentiation, is creating a further premium that will fall through to our earnings. So we have a probable mix outlook that includes offshore. We have differentiating technology and integration performance, and we have the foundation, the operating asset that you have done and the high-grading we did forward. So you combine this with the upside that digital brings to this, and you get all in a significant upside that we have in our margin. And we had anticipated 25% EBITDA margin sometime next year, and I think we are still very confident about that target.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Yes, good morning, Olivier. Obviously, some concerns around Russia kind of heading into the print. But I was wondering if you could provide more color on the drivers of the 20% sequential top line growth that you saw in Europe/CIS/Africa that manifested despite a decline in Russian revenue?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it’s built on multiple units in West Africa and Europe and Scandinavia, to a lesser extent, that has been benefiting from project timing from – partially in the production system that you have seen has benefited from a significant sequential growth. A large portion of it was in Europe. The same in offshore brand, I think we have offshore brands picking up in that region. And this has been very beneficial to us, including some explore into our performance. So you combine all of this, and we have had a fairly substantial growth, and we don’t see this necessarily abating a lot in the coming quarters. So I think we see a lot of further offshore and activity both in Africa, Europe, Scandinavia accelerating, as I said, next year, and that will more than offset the risk we are facing in Russia outlook.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Great. And just my follow-up, Olivier, you mentioned how Schlumberger is hosting an Investor Day in November, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the objectives of that upcoming event and what do you hope to showcase and highlight to investors at that time?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we commented on this during the last call. And I think it is an event where we invite investors and analysts to update them on our view first on the cycle, our strategy to execute on this cycle, and our long-term ambition we have for the company, building on our core and our digital and our new energy investment that we go forward. So that’s where – and you will see technology, you will see I think an element of our strategy, and we will expose all of you to the view we have on the macro and the long-term ambition for the company.
Arun Jayaram: Great, thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Welcome.
Operator: And our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, team. First question was just around…
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, Olivier. Just around your Canada APS assets, and how are you thinking about that? Are you still considering the sale? Or has the thought process changed given the macro environment? And alongside that, the monetization of the Liberty position as well. Should we be thinking that Schlumberger will look to continue to exit?
Stephane Biguet:
Arun:
Neil Mehta: Okay. That’s good. That’s helpful color. And then the second is a philosophical question. Schlumberger is now getting to the point where the business is generating a decent amount of free cash flow and visibility for that free cash flow to grow. How do you think about return of capital? And as you think about the preferred methodology to return that capital, do you think a buyback or a dividend is the most effective way to get that cash back to shareholders?
Stephane Biguet: Sure. Look, first, as you know, we increased our dividend by 40%, starting with the July payment. So this was a first step in increasing returns to shareholders in this growth cycle. Now, as earnings and cash flows indeed continue to grow over the cycle, we will review opportunities constantly to increase returns to shareholders. And it will be either in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases. We will also see exceptional cash proceeds from our continuous portfolio high-grading program, so this will give us further optionality. We will decide between dividends and share repurchases in due time. Dividend, of course, has to be sustainable, affordable for the long-term, but share repurchases will be part of the equation as well.
Neil Mehta: Thank you, Step.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good afternoon. Afternoon, afternoon. So as you mentioned there is growing recession fears in the broader market, and that’s weighed on oil and to weight on your stock. But Olivier, as you mentioned, there seems to be great resiliency here to the growth outlook. But I am curious roughly at what oil price do you think the multiyear double-digit recovery could be in Peru [ph]? It just seems like there is a pretty big buffer between the current price and where that price could be. But I am wondering your thoughts on – I think it’s important.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think – first, I think we are living through a supply-led on that. I think it’s quite unique, and it will take time before it recovers towards a demand supply balance. So, I think the quarters to come will be definitely quarters to be replenishing and securing enough spare capacity to avoid the exposure, the overexposure to risk on the energy supply. And – but you have the undercurrent that is on energy security that is clearing. And double sourcing, that is a new attribute of demand that – and supply, sorry, on supply that is doubling down. So, I think the buffer is pretty wide, in my opinion. And hence, the short-term and some of the risk on the slowing and/or inflection into the demand growth going forward, there is a decoupling and there is resilience into the investment cycle that we are seeing as we speak. So, whether this last, it’s very difficult to say how long it will last. But I think we see that this cycle is stronger, longer and pricier than we had anticipated because of those unique conditions that the security supply has just added a new dimension to it. So, I think there is a lot of space in my opinion.
Scott Gruber: Yes, we agree. And a follow-up on exploration, I know you touched on it and touched on its benefiting mix. But I am curious just how you see the recovery here on the exploration side, this cycle? The general assumption coming in was that exploration would lag. But just given a deep downturn in exploration activity and given a renewed focus on energy security, should we now be assuming that exploration activity will actually rise in excess of the general recovery as it usually is? Is that possible here?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. What we are witnessing actually is that below the screen, if I may use that expression, is that we are seeing a lot of exploration and appraisal program that has been – that are being initiated with some good supplies that we are seeing in the new frontier. I call it in Namibia, call it in Colombia, all over place. And we are seeing program and support for new exploration in Asia as well. So, yes, we are cautiously optimistic that indeed, the exploration cycle is back to a scale that I think will be accretive to our mix, and will be giving us the unique exposure from our exploration data licensing and/or from our reserve performance portfolio and digital also as we typically have a lot of license and digital solutions that address the explorations, sound workflows. So, we see this as a mix that is accretive to our future, and that is coming a little bit ahead of what we could have anticipated in this cycle.
Scott Gruber: Appreciate that color. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Roger Read: Yes. Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning Roger.
Roger Read: Yes, what I would like to maybe understand and focusing on kind of the back half and the exit this year on the EBITDA guidance, didn’t really raise that despite the stronger Q2, obviously, some positives on pricing. I was just wondering what you see to keep you, I don’t know if cautious is the right term, but let’s just say conservative in terms of EBITDA guidance relative to revenue guidance, is that Russia or something else that’s flowing through?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think first, let me reiterate the guidance we provided. We provided the guidance that revenue will be a full year of $27 million at least, and we provided a guidance that our EBITDA in dollar terms will grow by at least 25% year-on-year throughout from 2021. So, if you use this, you see that it goes up above the current consensus and have been adjusted for the actual bid that we had in the second quarter. So, we foresee a raise in the EBITDA dollar for the full year with this guidance that I just shared.
Roger Read: Yes. I understand that. I guess I was just really coming at the sort of – the up 200 basis points from Q2 – Q4 of ‘21 to Q4 of ‘22. Given the…
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. This is still our ambition, and I think this ambition is based on the seasonal impact that we anticipate through a particular digital year-end sales that will follow our digital form. And the mix that we believe will be favorable. So, we include international and offshore that are accelerating in the second half. So, this is still the ambition we have set for the team. And this is the reason why we have guided to the 25% of full year EBITDA growth in dollar terms or higher.
Roger Read: Okay. And then this is a little more of a – especially given the commentary earlier about best quarter since back in ‘15, and this is a cycle where a lot of the E&P companies integrated are being conservative in terms of their pace of spending increase relative to what we see in the commodity prices. I was just wondering, as you look at this cycle of this part of the recovery so far, what you can see in the back half of this year, thinking about next. What looks the same, what looks different? I mean obviously, you expect the exploration recovery to continue. But if we just look at the, call it, development side, are we leaning more heavily into that? Is the mix more positive than in some other cycles, or should it ultimately look a lot like any other cycle, just – it’s going to be stronger in one place, weaker in other?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. I think what is quite characterize the cycle is the broad nature of this cycle. We see it – we are growing across the four divisions. We are growing across the four areas, and we are seeing this set to continue. So, we see, as I said, a strong inflection in international that will outpace in terms of rate of growth in North America from the second half. We see also offshore, the return of offshore being a characteristic that will only expand going forward. The – if you were to just look at the – in terms of numbers, the number of jack-up big operating in shallow waters is actually on par higher than it has been for the previous cycles, more than 300, and deepwater is starting to catch up. So, I think we have a – we have a mix of signal that are clearly broadening the activity outlook. Hence, if I want to differentiate, it’s more the supply-led and tightness of the market, creating pricing condition that is unique in this cycle in addition to the broad nature of growth across almost all countries in this – in the coming quarters. Positive in all, yes. It’s positive in all dimensions, I would say customers, geographies and division business line. So, that’s what we foresee is unique. And it’s both, it’s production enhancement, it’s some appraisal acceleration, and it’s a development program, both oil and gas.
Roger Read: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we will move on to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: Yes. Thanks. We have been talking a lot about pricing, but I wanted to maybe just put a finer point on something. One of the big investor concerns on both Schlumberger and the broader oil services industry is the degree to which you will be able to extract pricing or improve margins not just in some of the less core geographies, but also with some of your big national oil customers. So, I am curious, based on how broad-based your comments have suggested pricing is, are you already seeing pricing or margins improve in some of your biggest regions with some of your biggest customers? Are your conversations indicating that more is to come? Just curious if you could address that.
Olivier Le Peuch: No. As I commented before, it’s broad. It’s happening today and it’s expanding. So, now is it in – for every contract, for every customer, and that’s what we are working on. But the customer understands, the customer realized that the market is becoming suddenly tight. The customer care for performance. The customer wants to secure capacity for their future plan. And hence, we are seeing success into our engagement with all of our customers into a positive response and adjustment of our price in the existing contract or into new contract. Into, as I said, a contract expansion that are negotiated one-on-one and with pricing increments or – and into tender environment where the pricing is seeing it. So, it’s broad, and it will continue to happen. And I think while – a year ago, it was mostly in North America with shops internationally. I would say that it’s very established in North America, and it’s broad now in International across all customers. And yes, some will take more time to materialize and some will face at a later date, but we are confident that the momentum has started and the market will support it going forward.
Connor Lynagh: Got it. Thank you. Maybe pivoting a little bit here. We have talked tangentially about Russia, but I was wondering if you could just clarify what your expectations are for the country, for your operations there? And effectively, what the wind-down might look like relative to your plans to cease investment in the new contracts there?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I think I would just reiterate what we said earlier and bring a little bit of clarity. But our position is unchanged since we communicated earlier this year at the onset of this crisis, and we have suspended new investment and technology deployment into Russia. However, our structure gives us the flexibility to have operation in country in full compliance with international sanctions. So, at the same time, we continue to monitor the situation very, very closely, very carefully. And we always put the safety of our people and assets as a first priority. So, we cannot and will not comment on the future, but we have taken a disposition to support.
Connor Lynagh: Alright. Thank you very much.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. That is from Keith MacKey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Keith MacKey: Hi. Good day everyone.
Stephane Biguet: Hi. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning Keith.
Keith MacKey: Hi. Just would like to dig into a little bit more on the cash flow and free cash flow expectations for the second half of the year. Stephane, you mentioned that you expect that to improve. Just curious if you can put some color or magnitude around that and is a double-digit free cash flow margin for the second half of the year in the cards?
Stephane Biguet: Sure. So look, first, let me come back to the second quarter to put some color. Our free cash flow was indeed slightly negative, even though the cash flow from operations improved sequentially. So, as you have seen, it’s all in the working capital. And to give a bit more details, two-thirds of the sequential working capital increase was due to an increase in receivables. But as I mentioned earlier, our DSO improved sequentially. So, really, the increase in receivables is due to the significantly higher activity we experienced in the quarter. Also, the inventory has increased, as I mentioned. We are preparing to fulfill our growing backlog, particularly in our Production Systems division. We mentioned this is the fastest-growing division, so we want to seize all the opportunities there. So, really, the working capital buildup we saw this quarter is to support the accelerated growth we are experiencing. As it relates to the rest of the year, we do expect the same pattern we see every year in the second half, where our working capital gradually improves on higher customer collections. Then we have lower inventories due to higher product sales towards the second half. So, we fully expect our free cash flow to significantly improve in the second half as per historical trends. And clearly, we maintain our ambition to generate double-digit free cash flow margin over the cycle for sure.
Keith MacKey: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And maybe just a follow-up on capital, it looks like you moved to the top end of your $1.9 billion to $2 billion range. Can you talk about where this was? Is it activity driven versus inflation driven? It’s ultimately where you think you will land for the year under your $27 billion revenue guidance?
Stephane Biguet: So, just – yes. Just to confirm, we are expecting our total capital investments, which include the CapEx, exploration, data cost and APS investments for the full year to be approximately $2 billion. As Olivier highlighted clearly we are seeing higher demand for technology and equipment, mostly in our core service division. This is where the most of the CapEx goes, well construction and reservoir performance. We are recording very strong year-on-year growth, so this is expected to continue. So, we will continue, of course, to maintain discipline in the way we deploy any additional resource, allocating those to the countries and contracts with the best returns in accordance with our capital to framework. So, just one note, the CapEx portion of our total capital investment remains at the low end of our target range of 5% to 7% revenue, and we fully intend to maintain that commitment throughout the growth cycle.
Keith MacKey: Perfect. Thank you very much for the color.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Operator: And I do understand we have time for one more. That is Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchi: Hello. Thank you. I wanted to ask first on Russia, just to follow-up. I think last you updated, Russia was about 5% of total company revenue, but at the time, the ruble had significantly devalued. We have seen an appreciation in the ruble since. Can you comment on where that revenue mix is today?
Stephane Biguet: Yes. Mark, sorry. Russia, throughout the first six months of 2022, is actually – is about 5% of our total worldwide revenue.
Marc Bianchi: Got it. Okay. Thank you, Stephane. As we look at the back half of the year, perhaps you could provide a little more color on the segments. I understand you mentioned D&I and production systems driving the improvement, but the D&I benefit would be largely fourth quarter, which is typical with seasonality, But there was an exceptional second quarter, so maybe you could just provide a little more color on the progression as we move through third quarter for the business?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, we have indeed a very strong quarter in D&I due to some very strong data exploration sales. But at the same time, I think we will see indeed the D&I coming back to restoring its usual margin to low to mid-30s and to progress through the H2 to finish on a strong end of the year through the effect of digital year sales as well experienced in previous years. So, while it was very strong, I think it’s still in the 30s, and we expect to keep it in the 30s, if not in the mid-30s going forward. So, we will see the uptick in the end of the year.
Marc Bianchi: Very good. Thank you so much.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Marc. It’s time to close indeed, thank you. So, ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, let me share with you three key takeaways. Firstly, as our second quarter results demonstrate, our differentiated global market position, our industry-leading performance and our technology portfolio uniquely matched to the market dynamics of this cycle. Secondly, the market fundamentals continue to support significant investment growth in our sector with an anticipated decoupling and resilience against the uncertainty of the pace of future demand growth. At the same time, the market conditions are increasingly supportive of net pricing impact on to current and true-to-contract both in North America and internationally. Finally, our confidence in the activity mix outlook for the second half, particularly the rotation of investment internationally, combined with pricing tailwinds, has led us to revise our full year expectation for both the revenue and earnings growth. This bodes extremely well for our future beyond year-end as we continue to secure significant service and equipment backlog to support our ambition in this up-cycle. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe there is no better time fortunately as we continue to execute with much success, our returns focused strategy and are set to continue to outperform in a market increasingly aligned with our strengths. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-22 09:30:00) =====
Updated transcript provided by the company.:
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.
Ndubuisi Maduemezia: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First-Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being hosted from Oslo, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my remarks, I will cover our first-quarter results and achievements followed by our latest view of the market environment and our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of the year, particularly internationally. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results, and we will open the floor for your questions. Considering the global context during the first quarter, I am very pleased with our start of the year. Sequentially, the quarter broadly reflected typical seasonal patterns, except for additional effects of the Russian ruble devaluation and a more pronounced sequential decline in Production Systems. Year-on-year, we delivered a strong increase in earnings and revenue growth along with operating margins expansion. Our results were particularly strong in Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, where we are maximizing our leading market positions, our top-tier technology, performance, and enhanced operating leverage to full effect, both internationally and in North America. All Divisions and Areas grew year-on-year, resulting in 14% overall growth. This was achieved through double-digit revenue growth internationally, and by fully capitalizing on our North America exposure with 32% revenue growth. Operating margins expanded in both North America and in the international markets, and we start the year with the highest first-quarter margins since 2015. This establishes an excellent foundation for our full-year margin expansion ambition. Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, our core services Divisions, had very strong momentum to start the year. In addition, we secured several new multiyear contracts and improving commercial conditions in a number of geographies and services. Digital & Integration also posted double-digit growth compared to the same period last year, with new critical commercial contracts, and significant advance of our digital platform strategy with the launch of our first INNOVATION FACTORI in North America. In Production Systems, our core equipment Division, year-on-year growth was muted by the impact of supply chain bottlenecks, which have pushed deliveries into subsequent quarters. Despite these transitory challenges, I am very pleased with the quality and size of the backlog and orders secured in the past 12 months. With improving supply conditions, I am confident that the execution of our response plan will significantly improve backlog conversion, resulting in an accelerated revenue growth dynamic in the coming quarters. In Russia, the onset of the tragic conflict in Ukraine and corresponding sanctions impacted the later part of the quarter. We swiftly initiated a series of actions to ensure the safety of our people and implemented restrictive measures concerning new investment and technology deployment to our Russia operations. We continue to closely monitor this dynamic situation and remain hopeful for the quick cessation of hostilities. Overall, and despite unique challenges, I am very pleased with the results of the quarter. I would like to extend my thanks to the entire Schlumberger team for successfully navigating these developments and delivering an excellent start to what promises to be a year of solid growth and achievement. Turning now to the macro environment, the energy landscape has evolved significantly over the past few months. Recent events have, on one hand, resulted in a change in the pace of demand recovery, while energy security and supply diversification have also emerged as preeminent global drivers that will shape the future of our industry, in addition to decarbonization, capital discipline, and digital transformation. This new dimension will have long-lasting positive implications for energy investment over the next few years. I would like to share how we see these dynamics developing over the short- and long-term horizons, and more importantly, how these conditions will play to Schlumberger’s differentiated strengths. First, in the short term, commodity prices are elevated, as supply conditions continue to tighten due to the impacts of capital discipline, consistent OPEC+ policy implementation, and the potential impact of supply dislocation from Russia. The industry is responding to this high commodity price environment with accelerated short-cycle investment in North America led by the private producers and a gradual increase in investment by the public operators, albeit tempered by capital discipline and bottlenecks in capacity and supply chain. Internationally, short-cycle investments are set to accelerate with the seasonal rebound in the second quarter and more strongly in the second half of the year, led by the Middle East and the key international offshore basins. Second, the elevation of energy security as a priority will drive further capacity expansion and optionality to deliver a more diverse oil and gas supply. This will support additional long-cycle development projects, exploration activity, and brownfield rejuvenation programs. Third, favorable conditions for product and services net-pricing improvements have clearly emerged and are expanding across both North America and the international markets. This will be a defining characteristic of this upcycle, considering the service sector’s newfound capital discipline and commitment to margin expansion. These improvements are absolutely critical to support returns and investment in capacity that will be needed to deliver on both the short- and long-term oil and gas supply the world needs. The combination of these effects creates an exceptional sequence for our sector, likely resulting in a cycle of higher magnitude and duration than previously anticipated. Schlumberger has led the sector in reinventing itself over the past few years, aligning closely with industry shifts, customer needs, and increased shareholder value. Since launching our performance strategy, we targeted trends that are manifesting today by focusing on the development of fit-for-basin technologies some of which are now unlocking much-needed energy supplies and by reducing or eliminating GHG emissions with our Transition Technologies portfolio and our new end-to-end emissions solutions. We have also expanded manufacturing capacity in key basins, such as in North America and in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to tailor fit-for-basin technology delivery. In Digital, we are enabling transformation in the sector, establishing the industry digital platform, DELFI; creating more powerful AI solutions; and leading innovation in autonomy. These advances in digital enablement are improving both customer operations and our own efficiency, as we evolve workflows and improve execution with insights from data. Today, Schlumberger is best positioned to capture the benefits of this unique upcycle, given the steady execution of our strategy, breadth of our market presence, leading technology portfolio, and our ability to derive premium pricing through our performance execution and value creation for our customers. Now I would like to share with you our outlook for the second quarter and the second half of the year. Sequentially, we expect a solid quarter of growth in both North America and the international market. Growth in North America will be led by continued short cycle activity, offset by Canadian spring break-up. Internationally, growth will be driven by the seasonal rebound, albeit moderated by the absence of the usual second-quarter uptick in Russia, owing to the uncertainty around the ruble depreciation, impact of sanctions, and customer activity decline. Taken together, this will result in global revenue growth around mid-single-digits for the second quarter. We anticipate the operating margins to expand 50 to 100 basis points, driven by further operating leverage and the positive conditions I have outlined. In that context, our sequential margin expansion trajectory is set to resume and subsequently strengthen in the second half of the year in line with our full-year guidance. Looking further ahead, the second half of the year is shaping up to be particularly strong, based on our view of a significant pipeline of customer activity, upcoming product backlog conversion, and the growing impact of net pricing. This period of the year is typically the strongest half, and 2022 looks to be no exception. While the dynamic situation in Russia and the potential reduction in pace of the demand recovery present near-term concerns, we believe the continued tightness in supply, elevated commodity prices, and supplemental investment intended to diversify oil and gas supply should represent a positive offset for 2022 and beyond. Accordingly, second-half growth will be driven primarily by the international markets, led by the Middle East and key offshore basins. Indeed, the offshore activity, already growing sequentially and visibly year-on-year, will benefit from secular growth in both shallow and deepwater environments as the acceleration of infill drilling and tieback developments will combine with a resurgence of exploration drilling during the summer, and with an acceleration of long-cycle development projects ahead of 2023. Similarly, the Middle East region will benefit from the combination of reinvestment in short-cycle barrels as we approach the end of current OPEC+ agreements and from the commitment to capacity expansion in both oil production and gas developments. Additionally, 2022 is set to benefit from higher discretionary spending and higher product sales and year-end deliveries as customers secure the necessary capacity for their 2023 growth plans. Finally, and critically, we anticipate that net pricing impact will further extend in breadth and scale as the year progresses, to benefit margin expansion during the second half, and become a unique attribute of this upcycle. With this backdrop, and despite the uncertainty linked to Russia, we believe that the favorable market conditions I outlined should allow us to maintain our full-year ambitions of year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and adjusted EBITDA margins exiting the year at least 200 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First-quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.34. This represents a decrease of $0.07 sequentially and an increase of $0.13 when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the quarter, we recorded a $0.02 gain relating to the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty Oilfield Services, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.36. Overall, our first-quarter revenue of $6 billion decreased 4% sequentially, while pretax operating margins declined 84 basis points to 15%. These decreases reflect the seasonally lower activity and product sales that we typically experience in the first quarter. The conflict in Ukraine also had an impact on our first-quarter results, although this was largely limited to the effects of the depreciation of the ruble witnessed during the last month of the quarter. While margins were seasonally lower on a sequential basis, they did increase significantly as compared to the first quarter of last year. Pretax segment operating margin increased 229 basis points year-on-year, while company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins of 21% increased 94 basis points year-on-year, despite the inflationary factors we are facing. This reflects the strength of our operating leverage, new technology uptake, and increasing pricing traction. Let me now go through the first-quarter results for each Division. First-quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $857 million decreased 4% sequentially with margins declining 372 basis points to 34%. These decreases were primarily due to the effects of seasonally lower digital and exploration data licensing sales, partially offset by improved contribution from our APS projects in Ecuador, following the pipeline disruption of last quarter. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 6% sequentially while margins declined 232 basis points to 13.2%. These decreases were due to lower activity in Latin America and the seasonal activity reduction in the Northern Hemisphere. Well Construction revenue of $2.4 billion was essentially flat sequentially as seasonal reductions in Europe, Russia, and Asia were offset by strong drilling activity in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East. Margins of 16.2% increased 77 basis points sequentially, despite the flat revenue largely due to improved profitability in integrated drilling projects. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially and margins decreased 192 basis points to 7.1%. This was due to the effect of lower revenue following the traditionally higher fourth-quarter product sales combined with delayed deliveries and increased logistics costs resulting from global supply chain constraints. These are temporary challenges that we are diligently working to remedy. Once resolved, this will provide for favorable upside to our revenue and margins in future quarters, as our backlog is solid, and we will ultimately return to a normal pace of deliveries. Now, turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $131 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $381 million. Our cash flow generation was seasonally low as a result of the increase in working capital requirements we always experience in the first quarter. In addition to the typical payout of our annual employee incentives in the first quarter, we saw lower cash collections following the exceptional accounts receivable performance of the fourth quarter. Our inventory balance also grew due to the product delivery delays in our Production Systems Division, but also to prepare for project start-ups in the second quarter and for the strong growth anticipated for the rest of the year. In addition, we took the decision to increase our safety stocks and lock in prices on certain long-lead items in order to secure supply and hedge against anticipated cost inflation. Although, it is reflected outside of free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $84 million of net proceeds. Following this transaction, we hold a 27% interest in Liberty. Our working capital and cash flow will improve each quarter for the rest of the year, consistent with our historical trends and we remain confident in our ability to generate double-digit free cash flow margin on a full-year basis. This will allow us to continue deleveraging the balance sheet and exceed our previously stated leverage target in 2022. Based on this and the strengthening industry outlook that Olivier described earlier, we announced today a 40% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increase will be reflected in our July dividend and will result in approximately $140 million of additional dividend payments in 2022 and $280 million on an annualized basis. This will have a minimal impact on our leverage and we will, of course, remain focused on strengthening the balance sheet. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. I think we can open the floor to the Q&A session. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hi, good morning, Olivier. What everything has happened over the past few months…
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, David.
David Anderson: Hi, good morning. I look over the next several years for your international business to be a primary beneficiary here. I guess my question is the ramp up of that activity. We’ve seen a lot of NOCs announced contracts, more tenders are on the way. We’ve yet to really see the materials and activity, and we don’t have a ton of visibility on that market. I was just wondering if you could just help us understand what’s happening on the ground there. It seems like it’s just a matter of timing. But are there any challenges that you’re faced with mobilizing equipment and services environment, you’re clearly confident being a second half story, you could just provide a little bit more context into how we’re getting there, please? Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Thank you, Dave. So indeed, first, to put things in context. I think the international growth started to be rebounding last year. I think, as you know, year-on-year in the second half last year, we had already posted more than double-digit growth year-on-year in the second half. You can see that on this quarter, we’re already at 10% growth year-on-year and the majority of our international geounits actually posted double-digit, and quite a few above 20% year-on-year. So clearly the momentum of activity pickup internationally has been initiated, and it’s not only short cycle, it’s short and long cycle as some FID have already been signed last year and more are coming in the way. So now looking ahead and trying to understand how this is hedging in the future. I think, first, there is a dynamic of call on international supply that will continue to happen as the demand recovery is happening and as the market is looking for energy security and enhanced diversification of supply. So international basins at large will benefit from this dynamic in the years to come. Secondly, you have the dynamic of short-cycle response to the tightness of supply as we face today and we will face for the quarter to come, and this will prompt not only activity of cycle in the second half of this quarter and in the subsequent quarter in all the short-cycle basins from Middle East to some short-cycle activity offshore and it will be supplemented in the second half by an acceleration of the long-cycle development. Indeed, we believe that the conditions are set for long- and short-cycle to be contributing at the same time to the supply growth of international market. And long-cycle is not only offshore, long cycle is some large capacity expansion, that national company, majors, are continuing to post. And offshore market, we’ll also see the condition of major and international operator continue to expand their investment. So, we are seeing this happening today. We are seeing this accelerating in the second half visibly as the combination of short and long run benefit the international market. And the OPEC+ as you know is ending their quota distribution at the end of the third quarter and this will unlock short-cycle. If you were to look at Middle East, a few countries have already made a commitment to capacity expansion in 2022 and beyond, and this will be supplementing the short-cycle investment. Offshore, you have seen some FID approval, you have seen some exploration drilling resuming last quarter that would just turn into FID and into subsea and the deepwater activity uptick in the second half and furthermore in 2023. So, the conditions are set, as I said, for both short- and long-cycles to contribute to supply from international basins, and we are very well placed to respond to this considering favorable market exposure to international markets, our market position with NOCs, and our exposure to both major and independents into key basins internationally.
David Anderson: So, Olivier, on the offshore side. You highlighted a number of – numerous -- offshore awards in the release today. It covered – I think it covered most regions. This has typically been a very highly margin-accretive business to Schlumberger. I’m just curious how much of this is related to the events of the past few months? Are you seeing projects starting to accelerate? I would think you’d start to see a lot more on the short cycle activity, you’re talking about short versus long, I would think maybe short cycle activity is selling because of this, is that true? Are you starting to see that materialize?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I will comment in two sides. First, offshore markets remain very relevant to many of our customers internationally, very relevant. Why? Because the economics of offshore market both shallow and deepwater have improved a lot in the cycle. Secondly, many of these offshore reserves are very well placed from a carbon footprint and I think this is something that plays again to reinvestment and expansion. And, third, I think the technology, the integration capability, and digital have made offshore operations more efficient, more effective, have an impact on short cycle offshore infill drilling, tie back with huge technology differentiation we have there, and exploration -- in near-field exploration on one hand. And secondly shorter, long cycle. That is a characteristic that we see accelerating as the majors and IOCs and some NOC that have unique basin – advantaged basin. We want to accelerate the FID and we want to accelerate the execution of the FID for contributing supply. And, again, integration capability, technology for performance impact, and digital will all combine to make this a reality. So yes, we have already seen the impact of this, and is only set to accelerate and will not necessarily link to the event happening the last few weeks. The last few weeks event will have the consequence of diversification of supply and security of supply. And this will favor offshore basins as one of the best things that can contribute to the long-term supply security.
David Anderson: Much appreciated. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: You’re welcome.
Operator: And next we have a question from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, guys.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Chase.
Chase Mulvehill: So I wanted to follow-up on Dave’s question here on the international side. I mean, obviously, it appears that this international recovery is going to exceed last cycle’s recovery. So maybe I don’t know, if you want to take a moment and kind of talk about how this will impact pricing and margin. I was actually just digging through some old models and looking at 2006, 2007, 2008 margins, and obviously the industry margins back then were much, much better than they were last cycle. So what do you think it would take for the industry to really get back, and move towards those 2006, 2007, 2008 margins?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think the conditions are set for directionally going there, clearly, and I think you have several factor playing. First, the level of activity expansion globally in every basin for every division is creating the condition for tightness in the capacity of supply, of the service supply and the equipment supply. And these conditions are extremely favorable for pricing power, because our operators, our customers, are looking to secure capacity and to secure delivery assurance as they reinvest into their basins, into their favorable assets to secure this participation to this supply market share. So, first, the pricing movements as I said or the pricing attributes will be a key characteristic of the cycle. Secondly, I believe that the industry has realized that technology can make a huge impact on performance, on carbon footprint, and on digitalization to deliver efficiency that we need to accelerate the cycle and deliver assurance of delivery of these extra barrels. So we believe that we have here the condition for an upside on the technology adoption, an upside on digital transformation of the industry trying to achieve operation automation, achieve drilling autonomy, in terms of operation, and all that will combine in addition to decarbonization. So you have these trends that are new, that will augment the mix effect that this market is giving us today. We have a favorable mix, international and the accretive offshore mix. We have a favorable pull and stretch on capacity of the industry with significant discipline on this side of the industry that will lead to pricing expansion. And finally, you have this adoption of digital, adoption of decarbonization, and adoption of any fit-for-basin performance technology that can make an impact, to deliver, because industry wants to deliver and participate fully to this cycle. So that’s the reason why we are positive on this cycle.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. If I could follow-up quickly, you started talking about digital a little bit. I mean, there’s obviously, tightening supply chain, you’ve got emerging labor constraints, you’ve got accelerated international growth, over the next 12 to 14 months, and all this should be pretty positive for digital, as the industry kind of searches for ways to do things kind of faster, smarter, and harder. So, with that said, and with that as a backdrop, have you started to see accelerated digital adoption? And if so, what parts of the international market, are you really starting to see accelerated adoption?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. I think you laid the case very well, I think, digital will be an attribute of efficiency, performance, and transformation in the cycle, no doubt, everybody recognizes it and everybody’s investing towards participating to this digital transformation. We believe with our platform strategy, we have certainly the most compelling offer to the market. And we have been building as you heard before, for the last 3 to 5 years, the foundation of our platform, and we have seen adoption accelerating last year. So year-to-date, I’m very pleased with the performance – the early performance of the year to our digital business out of our Digital & Integration division. It is already contributing to visible growth year-on-year. All the metrics that we are internally following be it the customer adoption of our DELFI, be it the number of users that are using our cloud-DELFI capability, or be it the number of, the scale and intensity of multicycle, of computing cycle adoption, all these are going sequentially and year-on-year, up. So, adoption is happening, you have seen some enhancements have grown during the quarter. And you continue to see adoption translating into contract and into growth, accretive growth for digital. Finally, I think, as we mentioned into the EPR, we have been announcing a year ago our INNOVATION FACTORI. INNOVATION FACTORI, our digital collaborative center that we have placed strategically and we just integrated the last one yesterday in Oslo, Norway. And we are using these places to expose our customers to the capability of our platform with AI and machine learning using our partner capability, integrating into DELFI. And the customer realized that we can achieve a lot. We have delivered 200 projects collaboratively for customers and the customer understands the power of our platform through this exposure and then come away with the ability to scale for enterprise deployment from this INNOVATION FACTORI capability. So, this is one other dimension of adoption that we see and as part of our offering to the market. So, yes, we are convinced this will be accretive to our growth this year. And this will be also having a fall-through -- a positive fall-through of our margin that will support our margin expansion ambition for the full year.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I appreciate the answer. I’ll turn it back over. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Yeah, good morning. Olivier, I wanted to get your perspective on any changes you’re seeing in customer spending behavior related to natural gas. You have very strong international and now U.S. gas prices. And just wanted to get your thoughts if you’re seeing any changes there, particularly given the fact that Russia supplies 155 BCM of gas to Europe.
Olivier Le Peuch: It’s a very relevant question. I think it’s a very topical subject with the operators, and indeed, we are seeing operators preparing, planning and being ready for accelerating their gas supply to the world market, internationally and in North America as well. I think this is touching all aspects of exploration, development, and production of gas. And we are very pleased for our exposure, our exposure in North America and exposure internationally. Internationally, as you know, we have exposure in conventional gas. And, I think, you have seen some recent announcement of renewing contracts in commercial gas in Saudi, you are fully aware of market exposure in Qatar, that we have benefited for the last 2 years that have already grown visibly to commit more LNG train for supply to the world. And you have seen also that we are going to participate fully and we are participating fully into offshore integrated gas development, similar to what we did a few years back with Zohr in East Mediterranean, we are doing with an asset for fully integrated gas in Turkey in the Black Sea, where we are taking care of everything from development to the gas facility that will be from – that will deliver our first gas from this. So, we are very well exposed. And finally, unconventional gas internationally in the Middle East, particularly, is getting significant support for regional consumption and you are fully aware of the contract, very large contract, integrated contract, we have with Jafurah in Saudi Aramco. So, the exposure we have on gas is unique, conventional, unconventional, offshore, onshore. So, and finally, if I have to add one dimension of technology onto it, I was very pleased. This week we brought the Board to participate to visit in Norway. And we had the opportunity to visit excellence, our Center of Excellence, for subsea processing in Bergen, Norway, where we are manufacturing all of our processing boosting equipment to serve gas markets in deepwater subsea environment. And in particular, the subsea wet gas compression that will be deployed for Ormen Lange to extend the life of Ormen Lange gas supply to UK for the long run. So, these participate in the energy security, these participate to the gas development and production and we are very pleased with our exposure. So we are seeing signal of acceleration commitment, and we are very well leveraging that for the future.
Arun Jayaram: Right. I appreciate that. My follow up is, I wanted to talk a little bit about cash returns, you increase the dividend quite significantly this quarter, but maybe Olivier or Stephane, you could talk about the framework, you’re thinking about future cash returns and how should we be thinking about further dividend increases from here?
Stephane Biguet: Look, it’s good question. Thank you. Yes, based on the market fundamentals, we highlighted, we do expect to continue generating significant free cash flow throughout the cycle. If those favorable conditions persist, as we currently anticipate, this will clearly allow us to, at the same time, maintain the strong balance sheet to fund new growth opportunities, and look for additional ways to increase shareholder returns throughout the cycle. So, this can take the form of increased dividends, share repurchases, or a combination of both. So, as it relates to a framework, we will, of course, provide further details at our upcoming Capital Market Day. At this moment, we set the dividend that level we are comfortable with to allowing us to balance our continuing deleveraging commitments with the overall capital allocation priorities.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And next we have a question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Great…
Olivier Le Peuch: Hey, Neil.
Neil Mehta: Hey, good morning, team. So first question here is, just more of a logistical question. I think in the back half of this year, the expectation is to do a capital market day. So, one, any update in terms of timing; but secondly, what do you want to achieve at that event? What are the important strategic priorities that you want to discuss with the investment community?
Stephane Biguet: So on the logistical side, Neil, the Capital Market Day will be early November and you’ll receive the invitations pretty soon. I’ll let Olivier comment on the main agenda.
Olivier Le Peuch: The main agenda, as you know, I think would be to achieve 2 or 3 key elements. The first is to lay out our updated view of the mid- and long-term outlook for our industry. And, of course, the engines that we want to participate fully into, the core, the digital, and new energy, and as such document our view of the market scenario and the way our play will expose us to fully participate in each of these three. The second, obviously, will be to articulate the elements of the strategy that will make you understand the tangible progress we have made, the critical milestones we’ll meet by 2025 or by 2030. And, finally, we’ll document, I will say, our financial ambition, and financial and capital framework to support this ambition of our strategic execution for the next 5 years and with the long horizon of 2030 for a target. So that’s what we are aiming to achieve this Capital Market Day.
Neil Mehta: Thank you. So we look forward to it. And the follow-up is, can you talk about your exposure to the increased CapEx here at Saudi Aramco and ADNOC, and how you see that trickling across your segments? Where do you expect spending to increase significantly here in across what business lines?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, generally speaking, I think, it is not only Saudi Aramco, or Saudi and UAE. I think it is the GCC countries, and includes Iraq as well, I think, that set are for a significant rebound in both short cycle to respond to the unlocking the quota at the end of the year and then long cycle with capacity expansion commitments that several countries have made. So, we expect the consequence of that would be, first, in the second half of the year, activity will start to see an uptick in the form of short cycle, and that will affect both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. And we will see also this expanding into offshore and onshore capacity expansion more into 2023. As you know, several contracts have been put in place to support this capacity expansion by this operator with first and the industry at large. And this will see an acceleration of investment in 2023 that will expand beyond the short-cycle visibly into this new development, new capacity, beyond what is happening today on gas and unconventional happening today in some of the integrated contract we already own. So it’s -- it will be widespread, I would say, and across the --all the divisions as we move into 2023.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, guys.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yeah. So, I wanted to touch on the new energy outlook here just given how the macro has changed. Obviously, valuations in new energy have come down and your cash flow outlook has improved. So does that mean in the years ahead, we could expect Schlumberger to be investing a bit more aggressively in new energy or with a better outlook for the core, is there less urgency to build out the new energy business? How should we think about that?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, it remains – our new energy remains a critical strategic pillar of our long-term strategy. So, we are set to continue to invest into the venture we have created. We are making tactical moves and strategic moves to accelerate organic and inorganic investment. And we continue to monitor the market and continue to hedge and grew exposure to this. So, the market condition that have slightly changed in last few weeks, do not change our view on the new energy outlook. We have been seeing some reinvestments, and you have seen this during the quarter, into geothermal as an alternate source of energy. You have seen that geoenergy being through the Celsius Energy venture that we have created was - is- a domain that was identified by EU, the European Union, to be invested in to substitute gas and hence, to lessen the dependency on single source of supply on gas. And I think you can certainly anticipate and see that CCS at large is growing as an opportunity for oil industry. And for us, as we work not only with industry as you have seen the announcement we made with PETRONAS, but also we are working beyond the industry, as you have seen previous engagement we have and continue to do so. So, I think, we continue to develop and mature the technology, ready for scaling them, and we continue to make organic investments and securing inorganic opportunity to augment our capability into that space.
Scott Gruber: And then you started to touch on my follow-up, which relates to the commercial opportunity and how that developed here going forward. And it does seem like geothermal is going to get a pull here. But can you speak to the other commercial opportunities and how you think those evolve, particularly from a timing and cadence perspective, given the backdrop? Does the commercial opportunity materialize more quickly across carbon capture and hydrogen electrolyzer, etc.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, we have been commenting on this before. And, I think, we’ll provide a very comprehensive view at our Capital Markets Day. And, I think, the biggest and long-term bigger potential is both on CCS and hydrogen market, we believe, first and foremost. And believe that the energy storage including lithium processing or extraction, as well as energy, stationary energy storage, as well as geo-energy, geothermal, are certainly shorter-term and mid-term opportunity that we’ll not miss to secure. But we’ll come back with more detail and more, a better framework for you to understand our ambition there.
Scott Gruber: I look forward to it. Thanks for the color.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: Thank you. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Connor.
Connor Lynagh: I wanted to ask about – thank you. I just wanted to ask about the potential recovery in the back half and particularly OPEC, you were alluding to the cessation of the supply agreement. I guess one thing that surprised us is while there have been some countries that have fallen short of their production targets, OPEC as a group has been able to raise production fairly significantly. And there hasn’t been as significant an increase in the rig count. I appreciate not all activity is captured in the rig count. But has that surprised you, and when do you think we see a sort of catch up? Do we need to return to 2019 activity levels to get to 2019 production levels?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. First, I think the OPEC+ indeed has been very strict into implementing the policy in respect to the quota. Second, I think with very few exceptions, the GCC has been able to indeed unlock this production without significant, at this moment, significant increase in short cycle activity to support that increase. This will position into necessary investment into supporting the sustained capacity in the coming months. Until then and until now it has been that the production of some critical countries were below their sustained capacity potential, hence the need for reinvesting, the need for accelerating investment, drilling or intervention, was measured and was not necessarily disproportionate compared to the past. I think you will see that transitioning into the second half, and accelerating next year and it will combine with a capacity expansion they have committed to. So they will be a hike in activity on two fronts, the short cycle to this time sustain maximum capacity that is established and an investment that will expand this sustained capacity in the future. So that is set to happen. It wasn’t necessarily a big surprise to us. I think that Middle East was a bit of behind in terms of activity rebound internationally until now, but you will see this catching up in the second half and accelerating in 2023.
Connor Lynagh: All right. Thank you. That’s helpful context. Maybe just flipping over to the Russia side of things, I’m curious, in your full year revenue growth commentary, what are you contemplating in your Russia operations? Are you expecting significant activity declines? Could you help us frame what the cessation of new investments actually means for your activity levels in the near-term here?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it’s obviously an extremely dynamic situation. For one, the sanction is certainly having an impact on the Russian economy and our operation will not be immune to this effect. But as currently, currency fluctuation, as you have seen, our customer activity level today or tomorrow. So – and there is also possibility of further sanction, so the impact of the first quarter, as you have seen, was essentially limited to currency depreciation and dilution. It’s very difficult at the moment to predict what the impact may be in an upcoming quarter considering the uncertainty. On the flip side, as I’ve described, the environment that we see and the dynamics we see in the market, and the anticipated response to this call for energy security is creating the condition to offset this uncertainty and offset this risk. And also, the decision we have made to suspend new investment will mean that we will be able to allocate this CapEx to this upcoming opportunity effective this year, and then being able to capture this upside in activity in this dynamic environment. And as you say, should allow us to offset and keep our financial ambition intact.
Connor Lynagh: All right. Thank you very much. I’ll turn it back.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Roger Read: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Roger.
Roger Read: I would like to ask 2 questions that are more or less margin focused, the first on Production Systems, which obviously is lagging, for obvious reasons. But if we don’t get a strong subsea or offshore deepwater recovery, what else can we expect that would lift the Production Systems margins as we go forward?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think there are 2 elements I think we need to-- we should really -- separate here. The first is the transitory temporary impact we have had on the excessive cost of logistics, and delivery supply chain bottleneck that we have to work through that had led to temporary costs that I think will over time abate and will reduce as we work through this supply chain. We have a corrective action plan with diversification of source of supply, using different logistics routes, and you heard about our commitment to some critical safety stock for inventory to secure less disruption going forward. So, this disruption aside, that has had consequential cost, supplementary cost impact, I think we expect this to be more subdued, as we go forward and we start to accelerate our conversion of our backlog. So what do we need? I think we have already this in the backlog. We have a very big backlog that we have accumulated for the last few quarters, that we keep growing. And it’s not only subsea. Our Production Systems is made of subsea, as I mentioned, I think we are very proud of some of our market position in subsea, including what we have seen in Norway, but also have a completion with a few contracts that we won in the Middle East, in Brazil, in particular, artificial lift, PCP pumps that you have seen that we have won just in Kuwait, with very good position; Production chemicals that are being pulled as well. And our midstream and surface Cameron capability that are fully leveraging, particularly surface, the upcycling in North America. So if you combine all of these, we have not only short-cycle exposure with surface in North America of completions, artificial lift, we have long cycle with deepwater, and some of our long-cycle participation into some gas facility, as I mentioned, in Turkey. You combine all this and you have enough backlog to lift and create an uplift into our growth going forward and actually indicative of Production Systems to be accretive to our growth in the second half.
Roger Read: Thanks for that, that was very helpful. The other question I have is a little bit more far reaching. But as we think about, or let me say, the base case is let’s assume what’s happened in Russia stays as is, the sanctions, everything like that, through the middle of the decade, spending in other parts of the world is going to have to increase to make up for lost Russian production at a minimum lost Russian growth if not absolute lost barrels. And, I was wondering, as you look at your margins and you think about sort of an equal distribution of that spending or that production growth in other parts of the world, should it be no impact on Schlumberger’s margins, a modest positive, or a modest negative if Russia becomes a shrunken market and some of these other areas have to grow in response.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, I will not try to compare Russia margin with the rest of our portfolio. I think, I will look at it from strength of the cycle, from the lead market position we have, and from the starting point we have today with having restructured and reset operating leverage, the exposure with digital, the exposure with an increasing offshore long- and short-cycle mix; I think these attributes that convince us that our margin will continue to expand. As we have seen this quarter, we have increased year-on-year, both NAM and international margin. And we have been posting the best margin since, then, 2015. And, yet, despite an impact in the first quarter from Russia. So I think we’re looking at it, as you say, the big picture. The big picture includes investment in oil and gas for energy security, diversification that will have a call on international supply as well as in North America, and an increasing mix of short and long cycle as capacity needs to be expanded and the reserves that have been depleted through the last down-cycle for the last seven years will need to be expanded again. So that mix is what makes us confident into our trajectory of margin expansion, and into the potential uniqueness of this upcycle compared to past, and hence the confidence we have in a short- and long-term.
Roger Read: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question that’s from the line of Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. One moment, please. And please go ahead, sir.
Ian Macpherson: Thank you. Good afternoon in Oslo. Just wanted to wrap up, Olivier, I wanted to ask directly, what is your view of the production trajectory for Russia, assuming the sanctions are what we see today, I know that you don’t want to be too specific with regard to the cadence of your impact over the course of this year. But do you subscribe to the idea that that at best Russia pivots from a steady grower to a steady decliner under the current sanctions regime?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, I cannot be speculating on this market condition. I think you see the same numbers as we do see. You see that there is, as I said, a potential risk of Russia supply dislocation. I think what is important is that the demand trajectory, that is recovering, and is set to further increase next year, compared to previous prediction, not only to offset that, but to also respond to the market, I think, will be contributing to overall growth, so it’s very difficult to predict. I think, we are – this is a very dynamic situation. And we are not here to speculate on that dynamic situation. We know that we have to account for assumption that it could be a demand dislocation. It could be a demand, or supply disruption from the Russia source of supply. Hence we know and we have seen our customer rotating and starting to anticipate and position themselves for participating to the call on supply that will happen from the second half of this year and the years to come. So that’s the only thing we can come up with.
Ian Macpherson: That’s a perfectly fair answer. But maybe put otherwise, how critical would you say that Schlumberger and your Western OFS peers are relative to the domestic Russian OFS industry with regard to their ability to lean on internal OFS resources as opposed to a Western technology and kit?
Olivier Le Peuch: So, again, we cannot speculate on this. I think, we -- our first and foremost priority is to look after the safety of our people, everywhere we operate, including Russia, and to comply with the utmost diligence to the sanction – international sanctions that are in place. To speculate about what are the consequences of the sanction onto the OFS industry in Russia, I think, is something that the future will tell us what is happening. But, I think, I don’t want to be in a position to comment on this at this moment.
Ian Macpherson: Fair enough. But thanks for all the other answers today. I appreciate it.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much. I believe that it’s time to close this call. So, in conclusion, I would like to leave you with 3 takeaways. Firstly, our first-quarter financial results represent a strong start to what promises to be a significant year for the company. In particular, the resilience and strength of our core services Divisions and the full participation in the fast-growing North America market have contributed to a very solid year-on-year growth and margins expansion. Secondly, the activity outlook is shaping up favorably as 2022 progresses and is set to support our full-year mid-teens growth ambition, despite the uncertainties in our Russia operations. Furthermore, in the later part of the year, we will gain from improving market conditions, favorable activity mix in key offshore basins and the Middle East, and broader net pricing impact across North America and international markets. Our confidence in the favorable market conditions and our mid-term outlook supports our margin expansion ambition and our commitment to generate double-digit free cash flow. As a result, we have decided to accelerate cash returns to shareholders through a visible increase in our dividend. Finally, we believe that the consequences of the current crisis will reinforce the market fundamentals for a stronger and longer upcycle, as the priority on energy security will favor reinvestment in oil and gas supply. Consequently, the outlook for the next few years is improving and, absent a global economic setback, should translate into an exceptional sequence for the industry. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-22 09:30:00) =====
TRANSCRIPT PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY:
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to ND Maduemezia, the Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
ND Maduemezia: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full-year 2021 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover our Q4 results and full-year 2021 achievements. Thereafter, I will follow with our view of the 2022 outlook and some insights into our near-term financial ambitions. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results and we will open for your questions. The fourth quarter was characterized by broad-based activity growth. With continued momentum in North America, activity acceleration in the international markets, and an accretive offshore market contribution ‑‑ upon which we delivered strong sequential revenue growth, our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, and outstanding double-digit free cash flow generation. These financial results conclude an exceptional year of financial outperformance for Schlumberger, at a pivotal time for the Company and in our industry at large. Underlying these results are the following highlights from the quarter: Geographically, sequential growth in North America exceeded rig activity, growing in excess of 20% offshore, and international revenue growth accelerated, closing the second half of 2021, up 12% versus the prior year. All international areas posted growth, driven by gains in more than 75% of our international business units. By division, revenue in all four divisions grew sequentially, and when compared to the same period last year. Digital & Integration led growth, posting double-digit sequential growth and record-high margins. Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, our predominantly service-oriented divisions, outperformed expectations with strong sequential growth and approximately 30% growth year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. Production Systems recorded year-end sales, which drove mid-single digit growth, though partially impacted by logistics challenges. Operating margins expanded in spite of seasonality effects, improving further beyond prepandemic levels. And finally, we generated outstanding cash flow from operations ‑‑ exceeding $1.9 billion in the quarter. All in all, I am very pleased with our operational execution, our safety performance, and our financial results through the fourth quarter. Now let me briefly reflect on what we achieved in 2021. In our core, we fully operationalized our returns-focused strategy, leveraging our new division and basin organization to seize the start of the upcycle. In North America, this resulted in full-year topline revenue growth, excluding the effects of divestures, and significantly expanded margins ‑‑ achieving double digits, one of the financial targets we laid out in 2019. Internationally, we also grew the top-line and expanded margins significantly, as international activity strengthened in the second half of the year. This also resulted in full-year international margins that exceeded 2019 levels. Taken together, these margins resulted in the highest global operating margins of the last six years, setting an excellent foundation for further expansion, as activity accelerates and market conditions further support pricing improvement. In Digital, our second engine of growth, I am very proud of the momentum we established during the year. We advanced on our goals to expand market access and accelerate adoption of our platform, AI capabilities, and powerful digital tools to reduce cycle time, improve performance, and lower carbon intensity. We built partnerships to achieve comprehensive cloud access globally, collaborated with AI innovators to deploy machine-learning and AI solutions, and enabled digital operations through the automation of key workflows in well construction and production operations. At the end of 2021, we have more than 240 commercial DELFI customers, recorded more than 160% DELFI user growth year over year, and saw a more than tenfold increase in compute-cycle intensity on our DELFI cloud platform. We also made significant progress in our data business streams and digital operations ‑‑ advancing our OSDU commercial offerings, autonomous drilling, and the adoption of Agora Edge AI and IOT solutions with great success. The Q4 results, including significant uptake in digital sales and sizeable incremental margins, are a clear testament of this success. In Schlumberger New Energy, we continued to advance the development of clean energy technologies and low-carbon projects. In 2021, we took a position in stationary energy storage, expanding our total addressable market, and advanced all of our ventures in hydrogen, lithium, geoenergy, and a suite of CCUS opportunities, including our bioenergy CCS project. Some notable milestones achieved include the signature of pilot agreements with Genvia, our hydrogen venture, with ArcelorMittal, Ugitech, Vicat, and Hynamics ‑‑ leading companies in steel and cement. And in Celsius, our geoenergy venture, we secured five commercial contracts in Europe and one in North America for a prestigious university campus. This was also a pivotal year for us in terms of our commitment to sustainability. We announced our comprehensive 2050 net-zero commitment, inclusive of Scope 3 emissions, and launched the Transition Technologies portfolio to focus on the decarbonization of oil and gas operations with much success. In addition, Schlumberger earned an AA rating by MSCI, and won an ESG Top Performer Award by Hart Energy, recognizing our sustainability efforts, our enhanced disclosures, and our commitment to apply our technologies and capabilities towards helping the world meet future energy demand. In summary, 2021 was a great year for Schlumberger. Beyond these operational and financial results and our ESG accomplishments, we made excellent progress in our core, digital, and new energy: the three engines of growth that support our success now and well into the future. Above all, I am most proud of our people ‑‑ their unique ability to execute, remobilizing operations across the world through numerous pandemic constraints, adapting to logistics and supply-chain dynamics, and setting new performance benchmarks ‑‑ all of which earned the recognition of our customers. I would like to thank the entire team for delivering a year of outperformance on every metric. They surpassed all of our targets this year and created excellent momentum as we enter 2022, for which I would like now to share our outlook. Looking ahead, we have increased confidence in our view of robust multiyear market growth. Tight oil supply and demand growth beyond the prepandemic peak, are projected to result in a substantial step up in capital spending ‑‑ amid shrinking spare capacity, declining inventory balances, and supportive oil prices. In addition, we expect more pervasive service pricing improvements in response to market conditions as technology adoption increases while service capacity tightens. In essence, 2022 will be a period of stronger short-cycle activity resurgence, driven by improved visibility in the demand recovery and greater confidence in the oil price environment. And as oil demand exceeds prepandemic levels in 2023 and beyond, long-cycle development will augment capital spending growth in response to the current supply. This demand-led capital spending growth sets the foundation for a strong multiyear upcycle. Indeed, this scenario is already being established, as the number of FIDs increases, service pricing has begun to improve, and multiyear long-cycle capacity expansion plans have started ‑‑ particularly internationally and offshore ‑‑ as seen during the last quarter. Turning to 2022, more specifically, we expect an increase in capital spending of at least 20% in North America, impacting both the onshore and offshore markets, while internationally, capital spending is projected to increase in the low-to-mid teens, building momentum from a very strong exit in the second half of 2021. All areas and operating environments ‑‑ short- and long-cycle, including deepwater ‑‑ are expected to post strong growth, with upside potential as Omicron disruptions dissipate as the year advances. In this scenario, increased activity and pricing will drive simultaneous double-digit growth ‑‑ both internationally and in North America ‑‑ that will lead our overall 2022 revenue growth to reach mid-teens. Our ambition is to, once again, expand operating and EBITDA margins on a full-year basis, exiting the year with EBITDA margins at least 200 bps higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. In this context, let me share how we see the year unfolding. Directionally, while we are still experiencing COVID-related disruptions, we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter, with revenue and margin progression similar to historical sequential trends, which will be seen most prominently in Digital & Integration. This will be followed by a strong seasonal uptick in the second quarter across all divisions with growth further strengthening through the second half of the year ‑‑ supporting our full-year, mid-teens revenue growth ambition and EBITDA margin expansion. This growth and margin expansion trajectory gives us further confidence that we will reach or exceed our mid-cycle ambition of 25% adjusted EBITDA margin before the end of 2023, leading to adjusted EBITDA that should visibly exceed 2019 levels in dollar terms. With this, I will now turn the call over to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.41. This represents an increase of $0.05 compared to the third quarter of this year and of $0.19 when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded a net credit of $0.01, bringing GAAP EPS to $0.42. This consisted of a $0.02 gain relating to the sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty Oilfield Services, offset by a $0.01 loss relating to the early repayment of $1 billion of notes. Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $6.2 billion increased 6% sequentially. All divisions posted sequential growth, led by Digital & Integration. From a geographical perspective, International revenue grew 5%, while North America grew 13%. Pretax operating margins improved 31 basis points sequentially to 15.8% and have increased for six quarters in a row. This sequential margin improvement was driven by very strong digital sales, which helped sustain overall margins, despite seasonality effects in the Northern Hemisphere. Company-wide [adjusted] EBITDA margin remained strong at 22.2%, which was essentially flat sequentially. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth-quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $889 million increased 10% sequentially with margins growing by 268 basis points to 37.7%. These increases were driven by significantly higher digital and exploration data licensing sales, which were partly offset by the effects of a pipeline disruption in Ecuador that impacted our APS projects. Reservoir Performance growth further accelerated in the fourth quarter with revenue increasing 8% sequentially to $1.3 billion. This growth was primarily due to higher intervention and stimulation activity in the international offshore markets. Margins were essentially flat at 15.5% as a result of seasonality effects and technology mix, largely driven by the end of summer exploration campaigns in the Northern Hemisphere. Well Construction revenue of $2.4 billion increased 5% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling, both in North America and internationally. Margins of 15.4% were essentially flat sequentially as the favorable combination of increased activity and pricing gains was offset by seasonal effects. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.8 billion was up 5% sequentially, largely from new offshore projects and year-end sales. However, margins decreased 85 basis points to 9.0%, largely as a result of the impact of delayed deliveries due to global supply and logistic constraints. Now turning to our liquidity. Our cash flow generation during the fourth quarter was outstanding. We delivered $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.3 billion during the quarter. This was the result of a very strong working capital performance driven by exceptional cash collections and customer advances. Cash flows were further enhanced by the sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, generating net proceeds of $109 million during the quarter. Following this transaction, we hold a 31% interest in Liberty. On a full-year basis, we generated $4.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $3 billion of free cash flow. We generated more free cash in 2021 than in 2019, despite our revenue being 30% lower. This is largely attributable to our efforts of the last two years relating to the implementation of our capital stewardship program and the high grading of our portfolio. As a result of all of this, we ended the year with net debt of $11.1 billion. This represents an improvement of $2.8 billion compared to the end of 2020. We are proud to say that net debt is now at its lowest level of the last five years. During the [quarter] (corrected by company after the call), we also continued to reduce gross debt by repaying $1 billion dollars of notes that were coming due in May of this year. In total, our gross debt reduced by $2.7 billion in the last 12 months thereby significantly increasing our financial flexibility. Now, looking ahead to 2022. We expect total capital investments, consisting of capex and investments in APS and exploration data, to be approximately $1.9 to $2 billion dollars, as compared to just under $1.7 billion in 2021. This increase will allow us to fully seize the multiyear growth opportunity ahead of us, while still achieving our double-digit free cash flow margin objective. We are entering this growth cycle with a business that is much less capital-intensive as compared to previous cycles. As a reminder, during the last growth cycle of 2009 to 2014, our total capital investment as a percentage of revenue was approximately 12%. We are, therefore, well-positioned to fully reap the benefits of this growth cycle with the potential for enhanced free cash flow margins and return on capital employed. With this backdrop, I would like to emphasize that based on the industry fundamentals and positioning of the Company that Olivier highlighted earlier, our financial outlook for 2022 is very strong. We have high expectations and, in 2022, we expect a “triple double” consisting of double-digit return on capital employed; double-digit return on sales; and double-digit free cash flow margin. It is worth noting that we have not experienced this combination in a single year since 2015. Finally, I am pleased to announce that we will hold a Capital Markets Day in the second half of the year. This event will allow us the opportunity to provide you with additional details relating to Schlumberger’s strategy and financial objectives. Further information regarding this event will be forthcoming shortly. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. So I believe that we are ready to turn the call to you for the questions. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: So Olivier, I liked your increased confidence in achieving mid-cycle margins sooner rather than later. And I wanted to dig in a bit on why that confidence has increased. Obviously, we're starting at a bit higher level, but the target is a pretty solid target. And I'm curious what are the key drivers around that confidence increase?
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Let me explain why we have increased confidence. And I think some part of the answer on this question is in the quality of the results we have delivered in 2021 as a foundation. And next, I believe that the current market conditions are clearly supporting our thesis for double-digit CAGR growth over a few years. So with this backdrop, I think we have, we believe, three or four factors that will help us continue to guide upwards our margin expansion. Firstly, we set a foundation. The foundation we have put in place in the last 18 months, the operating leverage reset, the integration performance execution, and the portfolio high-grading are here to stay. And this was already very visibly impacting the service-oriented divisions of Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, as you have seen throughout the year and particularly the second half of last year. And we saw we obviously have this surpassed already with the 2018 margin performance. Secondly, I think the market mix is set to improve and resonate to our profit of strength. An increased offshore activity mix has already started to happen, and we expect this to only accelerate as the year unfolds and further into 2022. The adoption of technology also is accelerating, as you have seen, including digital, but our fit-for-basin, our Transition Technologies and all the technologies that extract performance for our operations are making an impact today, and are getting further adoption by a customer and giving us a premium. And finally, pricing. Where a year ago, we were talking about green shoot pricing in North America, today we are seeing and we are already recording some of pricing improvements in a broad market condition, both in North America and also internationally, when we are getting awarded new contracts as well as when we have to mobilize and deliver unique technology to our customer. So, as the year develops, we believe that these attributes ‑‑ our foundation, operating leverage, our performance that differentiate our execution give us a premium. Our market mix, our technology adoption, success with customers and finally pricing, giving a tailwind to this will drive and further expand our margin to the 2025 ‑‑ the 25% margin expansion. So it's not about if, but it's about when. And we have gained confidence and we have moved forward our confidence in this into the 2022.
James West: Okay, great. That's very clear, Olivier. Maybe a second question for me. As we think about the cycle is really starting to take hold here, how should we think about the cadence of growth? You've given obviously numbers for 2022. But if we think about it by both geography and by division, where do you see the ‑‑ I guess, the biggest growth; where could there be some lagging areas? Like, just a little bit more color on that cadence would be very helpful.
Olivier Le Peuch: Maybe in one word, the market will be ‑‑ growth will be very broad across all geographies, across all divisions. First, as a backdrop, I think that's what we are realizing and that's quite unique. But I think you have to characterize it first geographically or very high level. I think it's possibly a tale of two halves, with North America leading the uptick of growth. Activity growth in the first half; international further accelerating in the second half. While we did end on the H2 ‑‑ over H2 of 12%. We expect this to be the base in the first half and accelerate further in the second half internationally, so that we are even accelerating into 2023 for international activity. Secondly, I believe that if we have to characterize what will lead and be accretive to growth. I would say America’s land, because of activity uptick, but I will also put offshore environment and Middle East. These are the three engines of growth that will pull this year’s growth to the target ambition we have put up mid-teens. So now, per division, I think the service-oriented divisions of Reservoir Performance and Well Construction will be accretive to this we expect, followed by ‑‑ because they are benefiting from this social environment, they're benefiting from the pricing, and they have strong both NAM and international presence. So they’re benefiting from long-cycle exposure and technology mix favorable. In addition, Production Systems will also see growth, building on the short-cycle exposure to North America and the backlog of contracts that we have won in the last few quarters that will execute towards 2022. Finally on Digital & Integration, it's a two-phase of a division here. We expect the digital to be accretive to our growth, while it will be visibly moderated by a flattish environment for APS production, going forward. So that gives you the mix across the divisions and across the geographies.
Operator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays.
David Anderson: Good morning, Olivier. So you gave ‑‑ you laid out the margin expansion and kind of how you're going to see that. I have a question on the other side of that, just thinking about mobilization of large tenders. You started up on the Jafurah contract in the Middle East, but I guess, typically what we've seen in the past is ‑‑ in these mobilization periods ‑‑ these kinds of extra costs that get weighed in. I'm just thinking about how that's looking in '22. I mean is that something that you think you're going to have to absorb in '22 and that therefore, ‘23 is sort of another margin uplift there? Or has that improved pricing on some of these contracts, kind of countered some of those mobilizations? I think you had said something about getting better pricing for mobilization. So if you could just comment.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think, Dave, it's part of the mix of execution that we have. And I think we always mobilize for new projects somewhere in the world. And we are committing to international growth and margin expansion this year. The last quarter was already having a witness of significant new project starts, yet we have marginally improved our margins last quarter, and we have seen the results of the core division. So we did it already. So I think as we accelerate deployments, yes, we are very critically assessing the cost of this start-up. We are working for customers to minimize. We are using our digital operations to remote and optimize our deployment of resources. And we believe that what we have done in the last quarter, we'll continue to do in 2022. So I think directionally, we are still set to improve our margin internationally in 2022, despite ‑‑ and building on this new project ‑‑ so we are very keen to start off this new project. We are very proud of the different contract awards that we won last year. And I think this is part of the mix that we're executing. And the more we ‑‑ the more activity and the more growth ‑‑ we will respond and continue to use efficiency and leverage our operating practice to minimize impact and engage with customers to get full recognition of our investment.
David Anderson: Understood. Okay. On the Digital & Integration side, you grew really nicely in the topline this quarter. I was just curious, is that related to more new sales of customers? Or is it more about the adoption pace of your current customers into the workflow? And I was just wondering, a second here, if you could just tell us how much that digital portion grew this year? I'm assuming it outgrew the 8% overall top line, but if you could provide any color on that, that would be really appreciated.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Let me give you a little bit of color into this. So first, I think if I have to characterize the uptick we've seen in digital sales at the end of the year is not a pure year-end sales effect on one or two large contracts and one or two applications and software sales. It's broad. It's very diverse. It's touch and expand upon the platform strategy that developed different revenue streams. So it's about new DELFI-cloud customers, and you have seen we have announced our progress one more time in last quarter. It's about new revenue monetization in digital operations, including Agora, including drilling, remote operations, and automation. It's about new data business streams where we have been securing contracts for OSDU foundation, where we are the first to commercialize enterprise data management solutions on this OSDU. And it's the follow-through on the enterprise contract that we have won in 2021 or in 2020 on DELFI adoption. So it's significant. It relates to the progress we have made in our platform. It relates to the acceleration of digital adoption by our customer and digital ‑‑ this pursuit of digital transformation by customers. And it translates into an uptick in each and every one of the digital revenue streams we have created and the success from data to workflow and to operations. So it's diverse, it's broad, and it's multifaceted. So it's here to continue to expand. So I'm positive on this because it's not a one-off. Obviously, there is a year-end sales effect there that we're not ‑‑ that would not repeat in the first quarter. But at the same time, something that I see expanding as a platform going forward. And we are in the early innings of this adoption. As we mentioned a quarter ago, we have 1,700 digital customers. And we are in the early innings of deploying and pursuing this large installed base with digital transformation. So it was the first cycle of this digital expansion and digital adoption. Actually, this would continue in 2022 and accelerate beyond.
Operator: And our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill: So I guess the first question is just kind of around this looming investment cycle that you and I and, hopefully, investors are starting to realize needs to happen. And you had mentioned that you expect a substantial increase in spending this cycle. So maybe you did ‑‑ you framed it a little bit, but could you kind of add a little bit of context about how you see this cycle shaking out? What gives you confidence in it? And what it means for pricing for OFS? The competitive dynamics have obviously changed, especially in international, where it feels like you've got more discipline, less players. And so just kind of frame the cycle and activity and where you see the most opportunity for growth. And then ultimately, what this could mean for pricing this cycle for OFS companies.
Olivier Le Peuch: Great question. I think the fundamentals, as we see them, have not changed. And actually, some characteristics of the cycle have accelerated ‑‑ have been accentuated in recent months. So the attribute that we put first is the outlook of economic GDP growth that considering the oil intensity and energy intensity will fill and will drive the oil demand as a key attribute beyond the previous peak, no later than at the end of this year, according to the latest projection, and is set to expand visibly beyond not only in 2023, but a few years beyond this. So the first is the macro demand situation is set to be favorable for the next few years. Secondly, I think the supply-demand imbalance and the supply, I would almost call it tardiness that we are facing is pointing not only to an uplift in the commodity price, but also is pointing to investment ‑‑ return to investment across the broad portfolio of our customers. So you have seen it in North America, no surprise. North America is still and will remain structurally smaller than previous cycles due to the capital discipline, but also due to the crunch of supply, including on the services side. Secondly, I think the international underinvestment for the last few years ‑‑ actually, the last down cycle ‑‑ combined with the dip in the last two years is creating conditions for a necessary injection of short-cycle capital and then long cycle capital investment to respond to the supply. So we are seeing growth in North America, albeit a cut, we are seeing a rebound ‑‑ a visible rebound in short and long cycle investments internationally. And I will insist on the long cycle because I believe that both oil capacity is being looked upon by some OPEC members to secure future supply market share, but also the international and majors are investing into their advantage offshore basins and we are seeing not only infill drilling, but we are seeing FID for offshore that are accelerating going forward. So it's a mix of offshore rebound, solid including deepwater, international short cycle, and oil capacity in land, and finally, solid growth in North America. So these are unique conditions that are tightening the capacity and that are creating the underlying pricing improvement conditions.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I appreciate the color. A follow-up to that would be, obviously, with this constructive backdrop for Schlumberger and the OFS industry, you've got a wall of free cash flow coming to you. And so when we look at this, obviously, you did $3 billion of free cash flow last year. And it looks like, over the next two years, that should be growing. So how should we think about returning cash ‑‑ how Schlumberger is going to return cash to shareholders? And then how does M&A fit into this capital allocation strategy? Because, obviously, you're trying to reshape the company for new energy ventures and things like that as well.
Stephane Biguet: Chase, it's Stephane. Look, I like your expression on free cash flow. It was indeed quite strong last year with $3 billion. Now indeed, we visibly accelerated the deleveraging of our balance sheet ‑‑ but we are not quite there yet at the leverage ratio we committed to. So we have a clear line of sight now to achieving the target leverage we announced earlier, even though there's still some uncertainty remaining at the start of the year. Nevertheless, with the market fundamentals consolidating, particularly in the second half of the year and into 2023, we have even more confidence indeed now in generating significant excess cash this year and beyond. So we will be able to maintain quite a healthy balance sheet, and it will give us the flexibility to increase returns to shareholders as well as fund new growth opportunities. So we will certainly provide a comprehensive framework for future capital allocation as part of the Capital Market Day that we announced earlier. Returns to shareholders are obviously important, and increased dividends and buybacks will definitely be part of this equation. As it relates to M&A, sorry, I didn't answer on M&A. It's also part of what we will ‑‑ it's, of course, part of the toolbox, and you'll get more details when we give you that more comprehensive framework again.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram: With the marginal supply source now moving from U.S. shale to OPEC, I wanted to see if you could frame what kind of changes in spending patterns that you’re seeing from the NOCs versus ‑‑ call it, maintenance work versus FIDs and things to increase productive capacity?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think what we have seen and we are already witnessing today, I think ‑‑ and it's visible in Middle East, but beyond is the short cycle ‑‑ the return of short-cycle activity to assure, as you said, the maintenance of production and with a small but visible increment of output supply. What we are seeing is also a commitment and some FID in the pipeline to increase oil capacity, sustain oil capacity for ‑‑ with a few countries committing to participate fully and are laying out the foundation this year and next year into expanding the supply. But what we should not forget about ‑‑ and is part true for Middle East ‑‑ is there's also a gas market that is being very sustained, that has seen reinvestments. And it's part of the regional dynamic and that is already seeing ‑‑ is continuing to see double-digit growth. So I think it's a combination of gas market being sustained and having had less setback than oil in the recent time. Short-cycle expansion and long-cycle acceleration with new FID capacity, and this is true from deepwater Brazil to the future investment in ‑‑ and the current and future investment in Middle East or FIDs that are in the pipeline in Russia. So that's, again, very broad and that combined short and long cycle. And if you were to project, I think 2022 is a supply-led activity rebound and 2023 will be a demand-led activity growth. And the capacity expansion, the long cycle will further further contribute going forward well into 2023.
Arun Jayaram: Great. And my follow-up is, your outlook on 2022 embeds 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansions in the fourth quarter. So that would ‑‑ if I did my math right ‑‑ that would put your EBITDA margins, based on the outlook, slightly above 24%. And so I wanted you to a little bit ‑‑ go ahead.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. As we exit ‑‑ it's an exit rate. We made a comparison 200 bps or higher as we exit 2022 when compared to the second half or Q4 of 2021...
Arun Jayaram: Exactly. Okay, got it. It’s exit rate. So as we think about 2023, your outlook is that you could reach or exceed a mid-cycle EBITDA margin of 25%?
Olivier Le Peuch: Second half.
Arun Jayaram: Second half. Yes...
Olivier Le Peuch: In the second half, we expect in the second half to reach or exceed indeed.
Arun Jayaram: Great. And I just wanted to comment on the drivers of that, would be just mix and just further pricing improvement?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, again, as I commented in a previous question, I think operating leverage will continue to give us a fall-through as we continue to leverage the structure change we have done and digital operation in particular. The mix will be ‑‑ with long cycle and offshore ‑‑ will continue to be digital part of the technology adoption across the different basins will participate in the mix further. And finally, pricing will expand. So I think this is the combination that gives us more confidence that we reached this midcycle prior to previous anticipation.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
Scott Gruber: So, clearly, your capital intensity is going to be down versus last cycle. But just given potential growth rates that we're seeing coupled with you and peers keeping a lid on CapEx, it appears that the market could be quite tight exiting this year. So, my question is, can you keep CapEx at a similar level to 2022 as a percent of sales into '23 and into '24, while still riding the multiyear growth cycle that we all hope unfolds?
Stephane Biguet: So look, Scott, indeed, our capital intensity has reduced quite a bit and quickly just because we high-graded our portfolio, we extracted more operational efficiencies and we had our capital stewardship program as well. But where we deploy assets only to the best-return countries and contracts. So now, for 2022, we are looking at spending total capital investment, including APS, between $1.9 and $2 billion. That's just a relatively small increase compared to 2021. As to the ‑‑ can we keep this into the future? It's a bit too soon to say. But we definitely, whatever increment we make, it's geared towards technology. It will be on the most accretive contracts. We want that incremental technology investment to be priced appropriately. And for that matter, we already have a strong pipeline of contracts that allowed us to do that at favorable commercial conditions. So we'll see how the year progresses. But for the moment, we are quite confident that the envelope we gave you allows us to fully seize the growth in 2022 and prepare for 2023. We will see how we set the envelope in 2023. It cannot be a huge increase for sure.
Olivier Le Peuch: But we'll keep the capital intensity of our business going forward in check. I think the capital stewardship part of our returns-focused strategy is clearly giving us a little bit of a new dynamic and a new mindset in our commercial and contractual engagement with customers. And we have the whole organization focused on effectively and efficiently using the CapEx ‑‑ the equipment pool that we have to deploy to the most accretive contracts and the most accretive engagements we have. So we'll continue to use this discipline to make sure that we keep in check broadly the capital intensity in this cycle.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then, of the $1.9 billion to $2 billion budget this year, are you able to state how much is APS? And if you do end up selling the Canadian project this year, how much could the APS portion step down on an annualized basis?
Stephane Biguet: So, look, we don't disclose the split of the guidance. There is a small increase in APS investment, but it's matched with increased cash flow. As you know, the way we look at APS investment is really based on the cash flow of the individual projects. And as an aside, we are generating very good cash flow within our APS projects. So overall, as Olivier mentioned, the business of APS, because it's just a handful of projects, is going to be pretty flat this year. And the investment level is definitely not going to increase in future years.
Operator: Our next question is from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh: Yes. Thanks. I was wondering if we could go back to pricing for a minute here. And I'm curious if you could maybe characterize, it certainly sounds like pricing has become more broad-based, but are there specific areas globally or specific divisions in which you're realizing more pricing. And I guess the question is, when do we see this in the results? I mean, is this broad-based, and you're going to be seeing it in 2022, or is this sort of early signs and it's more of a 2023 dynamic?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it's broad-based. But let me maybe underline what, where, and how we see pricing conditions getting developed, I think, and we see it in three ways. First, we believe that pricing conditions and commercial terms are linked to performance. So performance and execution, our performance contracts are differentiated and the impact we provide to customers gives us the opportunity to negotiate favorable commercial terms and keep or expand our market position with key customers. So I think this has started and this is, depending on the region, something that impacts our service divisions, I would say: our Reservoir Performance and Well Construction particularly. The second one is linked to, I think, capacity ‑‑ and I think capacity on unique technology, capacity on equipment that is tight, be it for offshore deployments or be it for high-volume intensity basins like North America. So this we have seen when the conditions are set, and we are getting an opportunity to expand from in green shoots to broad pricing improvement conditions. So this we have seen happening for the last year in North America, and we see this starting to happen in offshore deployment where unique equipment have to be mobilized, have to be secured, and they are done at pricing conditions that have improved over the last few months. Finally, inflation. Inflation is something that exists. It's related to market conditions. Inflation is something that we always deal with. And today, we are seeing more into the OECD and North America, but we are dealing with inflation every day in every geounit, as we call it, over the years, and we know how to manage it to engage with customers. It's more acute and it's more pronounced [in some parts of some basins], and we're responding to it with engagement of our customers and using the contract terms we have to offset the inflation pressures we are getting. So it's all about performance, including our technology. It's all about capacity tightening and it's about responding to the inflation pressure. So these three things are the lever we are using and that are starting to be more broad each of them across the different basins. Hence, it's progressive, and it's touching and addressing different basins and all divisions throughout 2022 and further into '23.
Connor Lynagh: That's all helpful context. The inflation topic, obviously, is one we haven't really talked about extensively. It hasn't seemed to prevent you guys from expanding margins significantly. But, as we look into 2022, I'd say the market expectation seems to be that commodity deflation could occur, but labor inflation could increase. I'm curious what you're seeing on that front? And should we think about either of those having a meaningful impact on your margins, either positively or negatively?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think first, as you mentioned, inflation is nothing new and had happened last year. And I think the performance of our supply organization, the way we are dealing with it, I think, has helped us to mitigate and shift to the right, if I may, some of these. And secondly, I think we have been able to engage commercially to offset and create net pricing condition. So I think we see this happening forward. And when it comes to resource versus equipment, I think resource is always a hot topic in our organization. But I think we'll respond to this by further improving and accelerating our digital operation adoption so that we offset some of the pressure on our resources as much as we can and can offset this pressure as well. So I think it's part of a toolbox that we use and that we'll continue to tune as the cycle unfolds.
Operator: Our next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Certainly good to see things turning around here. I just had a couple of questions to follow up on some of the discussions about expectations on EBITDA, margins, the mix that you expect to see. And I was curious what you would anticipate or what is embedded in the forecast in terms of a recovery in E&A spending within the overall spending increase, and if that's going to be less. And the reason I say that as we know several companies have essentially eliminated their E&A departments. How that might affect the EBITDA expansion that you anticipate '22 and on into '23?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it's a valid question. But I think if you were to notice some of the highlights that we have released in the fourth quarter, we had a rebound of E&A data exploration sales as part of the ‑‑ so the E&A is albeit very compressed compared to the peak of the last cycle. I think it's seeing a resurgence for two reasons. First, customers are trying to assess and reassess their reserves near around their hubs, be it on the land that they own, or be it on the key offshore hubs that they have developed to make sure they can fast track infill drilling and develop near-field exploration. So we see a lot of infrastructure-led exploration, not necessarily large greenfield, new, and we don't expect this to be the trend going forward. But we see that exploration is much more surgical exploration, if I may use that word, to be near-field backyard exploration, as we call it, around near infrastructure so that the operator particularly offshore gets to accelerate the return on the existing infrastructure and get fast track, fast short-cycle return on existing offshore. So we see that in Latin America, we see that in Gulf of Mexico and Europe, in West Africa, this is very broad. So we are benefiting from it, in our Reservoir Performance, we're benefiting from it in some of the key technology that we provide, including in digital. So I think, while it has been a step down compared to previous cycles, there is a keen interest and investment resurgence in E&A for this reason. And I think we'll see that as a backup of FID and it's true particularly offshore.
Roger Read: I appreciate that. And then just looking at the Digital & Integration segment, it's obviously one a lot of us are focused on, and I know you've got a lot of expectations embedded in it as well. I was just curious, if you look back over the last 12 months and forward over the next 12, kind of what's been a positive surprise? What's been maybe a little bit of a headwind there? And if there's been a headwind, maybe how you would anticipate that reversing as we look into '22 and '23, probably more from the customer side, but if there's anything internal as well?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, internal, I think we are very pleased with the progress of the deploying and continuing to build the digital foundation and digital platform foundation that support our strategy. Now, every customer has their own pace of adoption, their own intel in digital infrastructure they choose to deploy in which we need to plug. So our choice two years ago to go with an open data ecosystem foundation, the choice we have made to go in partnership with different cloud providers, different industry partners to expand our market reach has unlocked some of these customers to come and join us in our digital journey with our platform. So we continue to work on it. The last two years could have been a better and larger adoption, possibly. But I think we have the foundation in place. We are in the early innings, as I said, of full adoption, considering the size, the oversized scale of our customer base. So I remain confident that this is just the first step, and this will only accelerate. So we have the right foundation ‑‑ digital is here to stay. Digital transformation is here to accelerate across the industry. And I think we are taking it one customer at a time, and this is what is happening. So we are positive.
Operator: Our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: The first question is a modeling specific one. Working capital, obviously, a big positive item this quarter. Can you talk about ‑‑ do you see it unwinding over the course of the year? And any thoughts on trajectory there? And as it relates to that, Liberty, it looks like you sold $109 million of shares in the quarter. As it relates to that, should we think of that as a ratable exit? And is this run rate in the open market, or are you going to be opportunistic around share price?
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Neil. So working capital, indeed, was significantly lower in the second half, especially in Q4. And again, this was a very strong customer collections and customer advances. So looking at 2022, we expect the same pattern, very seasonality in working capital. Usually, it increases in the first quarter. We have payments of annual incentives to employees, and then gradually, it improves in the subsequent quarters, mostly on cash collection. So we'll see the same in 2022, where we'll likely be at higher levels in general working capital consumption as activity accelerates, particularly considering the exit rates we are looking at, but we'll strive to maintain this to a minimum. And in any case, we still want to generate double-digit free cash flow margins, and that's inclusive of any working capital movement, so that helps us managing with this boundary. As to Liberty, yes, we are quite happy with our equity stake, has actually improved quite a bit since the transaction was announced. We did decide to monetize part of it ‑‑ to start monetizing part of the investment, following the expiration of the lockup period. We still hold a significant share of the equity, as I highlighted: about 31% after the transaction. So we'll continue to monitor the value of the investment going forward, and we'll decide on further monetization based on market conditions.
Neil Mehta: The follow-up is you announced a Capital Markets Day on this call earlier in the call sometime in the second half. Can you just talk about what you want to achieve out of that day from a financial perspective? What type of framework?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we are willing to reengage with all of you in the live session, first and foremost. We want to lay out clearly our strategic framework going forward in the cycle and beyond, including our three engines of growth, core, digital and new energy, and we will support it by laying out our financial framework for return ‑‑ including capital allocation and return to shareholders. That's what we aim at doing at that time. And we'll be clearly expressing in that setting the long-term target that we set. I believe we have time for one last question, operator?
Operator: That last question is from Keith MacKey with RBC Capital Markets.
Keith MacKey: Yes, I just wanted to maybe break ‑‑ ask you to dig into your North American outlook for the 20% increase in spending this year. Can you maybe just sort of break that out in terms of what you might expect for drilling versus completion versus price inflation in general?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Good question. I think, first, I think the North America outlook we are providing is inclusive of offshore and onshore, and onshore inclusive of U.S. and Canada. So I think it's a mix that is a bit not difficult, but it's a lot of variables at play to decipher here. But to your specific question, we foresee indeed that the U.S. land, which is a big portion of this activity outlook, will be having a bias towards Well Construction as the market is rotating from depleting the DUCs to replenishing the DUCs. Hence, Well Construction rig-based activity will be the lead in a 20% plus. And I think we are set to respond to this with a Well Construction portfolio in that environment, and this will be very favorable to us. And the offshore environment is broad. And I think offshore environment will be execution of Well Construction and also Reservoir Performance. And so, when you put all these and you put a more modest and more moderate Canada environment, you have a mix that is favorable to our Well Construction and production system in U.S. lands and favorable to our Reservoir Performance and Well Construction in offshore environments, all of which combine to give us this ambition about 20%.
Keith MacKey: Perfect. And maybe one quick follow-up. Just on the Canadian APS, I know there was a sales process outstanding. Just curious if you can give any update on your thinking there currently.
Stephane Biguet: So we have received several offers for APS asset in Canada as part of the process we launched last year. So while we were assessing those proposals, the market conditions actually continued to improve and the value of the asset increased as a result. So we actually took the decision that the offers we had received were no longer reflective of the economic value and the cash flow potential of the asset. So we are not entertaining those offers at the moment. The asset is now generating very strong cash flows, but we remain open to all options.
Olivier Le Peuch: So I believe we need to close the call. So before we close the call, I would like to leave you with a few takeaways. Firstly, the quality of our results during the fourth quarter, particularly the cash flow generation and our digital sales, have helped us close a remarkable year with financial outperformance during 2021, supporting significant EBITDA margin expansion and very sizeable reduction of our net debt. Credit to the entire Schlumberger team for outstanding execution across all basins and divisions. Secondly, our performance strategy execution has resulted in significant progress in the adoption of our digital platform, the deployment of our fit-for-basin and Transition Technologies, and the successful acceleration of our new energy ventures, each developing towards a sizeable addressable market. Thirdly, during 2021, we had enhanced our market positions with key customers, ahead of the significant upcycle, and we will fully benefit from the scale and breadth of the favorable activity mix unfolding across all basins during ‘22 and beyond. This will result in significant growth and further margin expansion and will support our double-digit free cash flow ambition. Finally, the macro environment is increasingly supportive of a potential supercycle. As these favorable market conditions extend both onshore and offshore, well beyond 2022, we have increased confidence in reaching our midcycle EBITDA margin ambition of 25% in the second half of 2023. Ladies and gentlemen, 2021 was a defining and transformative year for Schlumberger, and 2022 presents a unique environment to substantially build upon our success and accelerate our growth into the future. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-22 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.
ND Maduemezia : Thank you, Lea. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited, Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from the Schlumberger Doll Research Center in Boston, following the Schlumberger Board Meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call, are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch : Thank you, ND Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics. Our third quarter results, our view of the near-term macro, and the exceptional growth opportunity ahead of us. I will then share some insights on the Middle East and offshore markets and finally a first view of the 2022 growth outlook. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results and we'll open the floor for questions. The third quarter results further emphasize our returns focus, consistent execution, and the advantaged mix of our portfolio. Growth momentum was sustained and we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, achieving the highest pretax operating margin since 2015 and cash flow from operations in excess $1 billion. Let me share with you some performance highlights from the quarter across our core, digital, and new energy. In our core, first, margin expansion was led by Well Construction and Reservoir Performance where we fully seized the sequential growth opportunity driving operating margins in both these divisions above mid-teens, the highest levels in the last 3 years. Revenue quality improved, boosted by a favorable activity mix and higher new technology uptake that delivered strong margin expansion. Second, internationally, we recorded growth in all 3 areas with revenue up 11% year-on-year, consistent with our ambition of double-digit revenue growth compared to the second half of 2020. International margin further expanded, exceeding prepandemic levels and are at the highest since 2018. In North America, revenue growth was sustained, albeit impacted by transitory supply and logistics disruption. Margins also continued to expand with operating margins firmly at double digits. Finally, we are pleased with the very sizable activity pipeline secured during the quarter, through competitive tenders, direct awards, and contract extensions, some of which included net pricing improvement, building on our differentiated performance, integration capabilities, and technology. These wins enhance our market position, creating a long tail of activity and a platform to further new technology adoption and digital deployment, strengthening our leadership as we enter an exceptional growth cycle. We are delivering on the promise of our performance strategy, which is increasingly impacting our top- and bottom-line results, both in North America and internationally. As the cycle accelerates, we will leverage our advantaged platform to capture the exciting growth and outperform the market in our core going forward. Moving to Digital: we continued to progress our platform strategy this quarter, expanding our offering through the acquisition of Independent Data Services and a strategic investment in DeepIQ to further advance our digital technology offering and the adoption of AI solutions in our industry. In digital production operations, we announced a partnership with AVEVA to expand powerful edge and IoT solutions to the field, complementing our Agora* platform and Sensia solutions. And in digital drilling, we successfully completed the first fully automated section drilled offshore at the Hebron platform for ExxonMobil in Canada, as you have seen in this morning's earnings release. This achievement is a significant step for our industry, particularly offshore, and signals a momentous opportunity to apply digital technology to create a step change in well construction safety, performance, and carbon footprint. As shared recently, we are seeing the adoption of digital solutions accelerate in our industry. And whilst we are in the early innings, we are excited about the prospect of transitioning the majority of our software customer base of over 1,700 companies to our digital platform during the next few years. This growing adoption will generate an expanding set of digital revenue streams over a long horizon as we transition every customer to new digital solutions for the data, workflows, and operations. Moving to New Energy, we advanced our portfolio by taking a position stationary energy storage through our strategic investment in EnerVenue, a company with differentiated metal-hydrogen battery technology. This represents a new opportunity set and an expansion of total addressable market in a sector with significant growth opportunities. In geoenergy, following the success of the pilot in our technology facility in France, Celsius Energy has secured 5 commercial contracts in Europe. This is a significant achievement in the commercialization roadmap for Celsius as a low-carbon solution for heating and cooling buildings, contributing to global efforts in reducing emissions. To conclude on this quarter’s performance, we once again demonstrated excellent progress in our strategic execution across our portfolio, supporting outstanding results. And I want to thank the entire Schlumberger team, not only for delivering another strong quarter, but for their unwavering efforts to create enduring value for our customers and our shareholders. Now I would like to turn to the near-term macro and growth opportunity ahead of us. The market fundamentals have improved steadily throughout 2021, especially over the last few weeks, with oil and gas prices attaining recent highs, inventories at their lowest levels in recent history, a rebound in demand and encouraging trends in the pandemic containment efforts. This strengthening in industry fundamentals, combined with the action of OPEC+ and continued capital discipline in North America have firmly established a prospect of an exceptional multiyear growth cycle ahead. In the international markets, all regions are set to benefit from this highly favorable environment, something not seen internationally since the last supercycle. This expansion will occur at different –paces across different basins, operating environments, and customer groups resulting in a sustained multipronged growth cycle. Our broad exposure across these different dimensions put us in an advantaged position to fully seize this growth opportunity. For example, this growth inflection is already visibly underway in Latin America, sparked by the resumption of exploration and the initiation of long-cycle development campaigns. Activity has strengthened throughout 2021 and revenue in this market is already at 2019 pre -pandemic levels. Year-to-date revenue growth in Latin America is at 30%, with broad activity growth across multiple countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Guyana. This growth is expected to strengthen further in the coming years due to ongoing long-cycle development campaigns. By contrast, in the Middle East, where activity has been more subdued in 2021, the market conditions are set for a material uptick of activity in the coming quarters. The combination of short-cycle activity to meet supply commitments, strategic oil capacity expansion, and the acceleration of gas development projects will result in a significant increase in investment throughout 2022 and beyond. Our recent success in tender awards, as detailed in our earnings release, strengthens our market position and with our strong presence and commitment will benefit the most from this exciting outlook in the region. In the offshore markets, we're also set for a strong resurgence this cycle. Rig activity grew for the third sequential quarter internationally and is expected to build on the notable increase in development FIDs in the coming years. Advances in new technology, digital, and integration are driving performance impact offshore -- from discovery to well construction, production, and recovery, and are creating the conditions for offshore operators to reinvest with confidence in this cycle. In North America, the imminent resumption of lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have significant market presence, will drive additional offshore growth as operators capitalize on the advantage of this prolific basin and its existing takeaway infrastructure and extract more value from the core upstream position through exploration and tiebacks. Taking these factors together a broad offshore resurgence will result from IOCs building on their advantaged hubs, independents fast-tracking development on their recently acquired assets, and NOCs unlocking their gas and oil reserve recovery potential. Our technology, digital enablement, and integration capability are critical advantages in this market environment and are resulting in significant new contract awards, both internationally and in North America. Finally, we're extremely pleased with our customer reception of our Transition Technologies* portfolio and the accelerated adoption of these technologies that reduce the carbon impact of oil and gas operations. This portfolio is focused on fugitive emissions, flaring, and electrification, and is already helping customers decarbonize operations, advancing our net zero ambition and strengthening our sustainability leadership in the industry. Some examples of this impact are cited in our highlights. Turning to the fourth-quarter outlook. Directionally, we anticipate another quarter of growth with an ambition for growth across all divisions. Growth will be led by Production Systems and Digital & Integration, benefiting from a year-end sales uplift tempered by typical seasonality in Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This should result in an overall sequential growth rate similar to the prior quarter. With this fourth quarter outlook, we expect to reach our double-digit international growth ambition for the second half of 2021, when compared to the second half of 2020. It will also translate into full-year revenue growth, both internationally and in North America after adjusting for the effect of divestitures. Building on third quarter operating margin and recent highs, our ambition is to sustain this level of margin performance in the fourth quarter. Consequently, on a full-year basis, we remain confident in attaining the high end of our guidance of 250 to 300 bps EBITDA margin expansion, an excellent foundation for expansion in the year ahead. Now I would like to close my prepared remarks with our earliest views of 2022. Against the backdrop of the constructive environment I described earlier, our confidence in the onset of an exceptional growth cycle is reinforced. At this early point in the planning cycle, and absent a setback in economic and pandemic recoveries, we anticipate very strong global upstream capital spending growth. This growth will impact all basins, every operating environment, short- and long-cycle activity, and all customer groups. In North America, we anticipate capital spending growth to increase around 20%, impacting both the onshore and offshore markets. Internationally, growth momentum will strengthen and early indications point to strong capital spending growth in the low- to mid-teens, driven by both short-cycle activity and the onset of multiyear capacity expansion plans. Through our performance strategy, we have strengthened our position across multiple dimensions. In North America, we have enhanced our market position and are now biased to accretive growth onshore and will benefit from strong growth offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. And in the international markets, we have built a multiyear pipeline of strong activity in the most prolific basins that will lead the supply response, both in oil and gas. More importantly, we have enhanced our earnings growth potential significantly, as demonstrated by multiple quarters of margin expansion. In North America, our operating margins are primed to exit the year at the highest levels since 2015, which combined with the favorable market position I’ve just described, is an excellent platform for margin expansion. Internationally, we’re also set for peer-leading margin expansion as we exit 2021 with margins above prepandemic levels. The combination of strong activity growth and operating leverage will support durable margin expansion. Additionally, through our fit-for-basin and Transition Technologies and capacity tightening, we see favorable conditions for broader net pricing net gains in the coming years in both North America and the international markets. Finally, as a result of our digital platform strategy and growing customer adoption, we anticipate an acceleration of our digital journey resulting in accretive revenue and earnings growth. Consequently, we expect margins to expand further in 2022, supporting material earnings growth potential and we are increasingly confident in achieving our midcycle adjusted EBITDA margin ambition of 25% or higher and sustaining a double-digit free cash flow margin throughout the cycle. I will now pass the call to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet : Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.36. This represents an increase of $0.06 compared to the second quarter of this year and an increase of $0.20 when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded in the third quarter a $0.03 gain relating to a startup company we had previously invested in. This Company was acquired during the quarter and as a result, our ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company. Overall, our third quarter revenue of $5.8 billion increased 4% sequentially. Pretax operating margins improved 120 basis points to 15.5% and have now increased 5 quarters in a row. Margins expanded sequentially in 3 of our 4 divisions, with very strong incremental margin in both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This performance was due to a favorable geographic mix, driven by continued international revenue growth, as well as a favorable technology mix with increased exploration and appraisal activity and new technology adoption. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2% in the quarter increased 90 basis points sequentially. It is worth noting that this margin expansion was achieved despite the well-documented disruptions in global supply chain systems and inflation in select commodities and materials as well as in logistics. Through our global supply chain organization, we are successfully engaging with our suppliers and customers to jointly navigate inflationary trends. We are collaborating with our customers to optimize planning, and where applicable, make the necessary adjustments through existing contractual clauses or negotiation, . As a result, so far, we have largely been able to shield ourselves from the inflation effects. As the growth cycle accelerates, we will continue to be proactive, dynamically adjusting sourcing strategies and leveraging our diverse global manufacturing footprint and supply network. Let me now go through the third-quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $812 million was essentially flat sequentially as lower sales of digital solutions were offset by higher APS revenue. Pretax operating margins increased 154 basis points to 35%, largely as a result of improved commodity pricing in our Canada APS project. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 7% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity. Margins expanded 202 basis points to 16%, largely due to higher offshore and exploration activity, as well as accelerated new technology adoption. Well Construction revenue of $2.3 billion increased 8% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling both internationally and in North America. Margins increased 230 basis points to 15.2% due to the higher drilling activity and a favorable geographical mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.7 billion was essentially flat sequentially, while margins decreased 27 basis points to 9.9%. Now, turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operations was once again strong as we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $671 million during the quarter. This represented a significant sequential increase when adjusting for last quarter's exceptional tax refund of $477 million. We paid $42 million of severance during the quarter. Excluding these payments, the working capital impact on our cash flow was neutral despite the revenue increase. This was driven by a very strong DSO performance. We expect the fourth quarter to show another quarter of strong free cash flow generation, which positions us favorably to achieve our ambition of delivering full year double-digit free cash flow margins. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, net debt decreased sequentially by $588 million to $12.5 billion. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $399 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects, and multiclient. For the full year 2021, we are now expecting to spend approximately $1.6 billion on capital investments. In total, during the first 9 months of the year, we have generated over $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.7 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we have been able to progress significantly on our commitment to deleverage the balance sheet. This is evidenced by the fact that gross debt has decreased by almost $1.5 billion since the beginning of the year. Net debt has reduced by $1.4 billion during the same period. Overall, I am very pleased with our cash flow performance and the progress we are making towards strengthening the balance sheet. This will provide us with greater flexibility in our capital allocation. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. So I think we are ready for the Q&A session at this point.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI.
James C. West : So Olivier, 5 sequential quarters in a row of margin growth and really strong execution. How do you think about or how are you considering or planning for continued strong execution as revenue starts to really accelerate as we go into next year?
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James, for the question. Indeed, we are very, very proud and very satisfied with the last 5 quarters. I think they have demonstrated our ability to leverage restructuring, portfolio high-grading, and the foundation we have put in place during this reset we have operated in the last 18 months. But furthermore, I think the -- looking forward as the cycle will unfold, I think there are 2 or 3 characteristics that are – that will play favorably, and that will help us continue to expand the margin as we have seen in the last quarter. So first, I believe that the market outlook will create a favorable market environment, exposing the basins where we have a strong position internationally and, in particular, Middle East offshore as I commented during my prepared remarks. Secondly, I believe that performance still matters and will matter increasingly. Hence our technology offering, fit-for-basin, Transition Technologies, and integration capability will continue to make a huge impact, will create a premium for service in both Well Construction, Reservoir Performance, and Production Systems. Digital, we see an acceleration going forward, as you have seen that we have continued to evolve, progress, and mature our digital platform strategy, and we are in the last innings of developing this strategy on the platform, on the foundations. Hence, we are now seeing increased adoption and acceleration. And we expect, as I said earlier, that this will be increasingly accretive to growth and earnings going forward. And finally, as the revenue and as the activity both internationally and in North America will increase, this will tighten the market and create a condition for pricing. So when you combine this favorable market exposure, the track record we have, the technology adoption that gives us a premium and a performance differentiation, and integrated contract with digital, you have the formula for supporting our ambition for 25% or higher EBITDA margin by mid-cycle.
James C. West : Right. Okay, great, that's very helpful, Olivier. And then, maybe a follow-up on that. On the digital side, this will be the first cycle where we’ll really see digital as a big part of the business. There's been, as you alluded to, widespread adoption but we haven’t yet seen the growth cycle with that adoption. So how do you think that plays out? Is it going to allow you -- I mean, obviously, margins will be part of it that does allow you to grab more market share. I mean, what are the -- what does digital do in an up-cycle that is essentially a strong one like we're projecting?
Olivier Le Peuch : I think I will highlight 3 things that will be a result of our success and our investment and leadership in digital. First, obviously, the acceleration of digital adoption by customers through our workflow, data, and digital operation offering, and you are seeing elements of this being announced every quarter. And you will continue to see this unfolding across the different customer groups and across different geographies. So this will mean accretive growth in 2022 to our top line by the digital offering, we have. The second aspect is the long-tail effect beyond the cycle. I believe that the effect is -- certainly will last, considering the very significant size of our customer portfolio, the fact that customers are going into it over the long run. We are seeing multiple effects of revenue stream being deployed across multiple quarters and multiple years across the different customer groups we are addressing. And finally, this is generating margins fall-through that are accretive to earnings and will continue to help us operate D&I at or above 30% or mid-30s and also will result in our ability to extract from digital operations and our own operation, particularly integrated performance in Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, the ability to extract more efficiency and hence to expand and support margin expansion on those divisions.
Operator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
J. David Anderson : Want to ask you a couple of questions about the unconventional contracts that you announced in Saudi and Oman. So could you just help us understand the pricing mechanisms there -- are these lump sum? Is there a baseline of stages per day? And also, just curious where you're sourcing all this equipment? Do you have all this equipment? Does it require capital? Just a little bit more background on these contracts, please.
Olivier Le Peuch : I think this contract are large integrated contracts that we have been winning on our value proposition based on performance, on demonstrated efficiency, and ability to deploy technology that makes an impact on execution. We do have the capacity in place. We have demonstrated to pilots and/or to engagements that we had before that we could deliver the required performance that the customers are expecting. And we have priced it accordingly and we demonstrated during the last few years that we have improved our ability to engage, digitalize our operation, and work with customers to get this integrated contract, whether it’s LSTK or other, to be performing and delivering the margins and earnings we need. So we will continue to extract value from these contracts over a period of time. So we are very proud of winning those contracts. They are based on performance; they are based on technology and our team on the ground. They have done a great job of demonstrating they could take these contracts and get value for customers and for ourselves.
J. David Anderson : And then, in terms of the equipment required, do you need to add equipment? Do you need to build out at all?
Olivier Le Peuch : No, we have started to mobilize this equipment that we have already in place. And obviously, this will pull equipment from other places where we had it. But we have the equipment in place and we’re able to deliver upon the committed contract we are taking in both Oman and in Saudi.
J. David Anderson : And so my other question is around offshore. You seem to be a bit more optimistic than most on the offshore market. You announced several awards recently. Are you confident enough to say we're at an inflection point you think, in offshore spend, which I would think would be quite accretive to your margins with higher utilization of OneSubsea? And also all the technology you have in well construction, you also mentioned digital as well. Could you just kind of talk a little bit about maybe kind of how you're seeing this unfolding over the next year or so?
Olivier Le Peuch : Yes, I think I remain constructive about the offshore environment for a couple of reasons. First, because this offshore environment has been strengthening steadily for the last few quarters, and that's been the rig activity has been increasing lately. And I think we have, in the offshore international market, been growing in the mid-teens, year-on-year and in H2 over H2. So that's proof that this activity is translating into revenue opportunity. And I think the offshore markets, both particularly internationally, have been growing and rebounding in the last –two to four quarters. But now, looking ahead and looking at the activity, we see a lot of leading indicators. First, the FIDs. If you look at the actual FID of this year, or if you look at the projection of some of the WoodMac projection recently published, showing that there will be in excess of $100 million of offshore FID, most likely sanctioned by the end of this year, and that will almost double next year. And out of this, 50% of that will be deepwater. So there is an acceleration of FID back to the 2019 level that is on the horizon. And that is a result of IOCs going to exploit their advantaged basin and focusing hubs, the National Oil Company exploiting and unlocking the oil and gas reserve to participate to the supply. And finally, there has been a lot of assets trading hands in the last few quarters. And these international independents are also pursuing accelerated FID in different basins we are exposed. And the result of that is subsea backlog is growing. We are definitely above 1 book-to-bill ratio. And we will certainly be growing year-on-year in excess of 30% or 40% of booking from 2021 -- 2020 to 2021. So we are indeed quite positive and constructive, and this plays very well to our portfolio because this Well Construction, Reservoir Performance in exploration appraisal, in large offshore contracts are getting the benefit, and it was very visible during the third quarter. So you could take this as a proxy of the future.
Operator: And our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill: I guess first thing, kind of a macro kind of higher-level question about this investment cycle. There seems to be this growing narrative out there that the oil and gas industry is going to continue to under-invest this cycle given the discipline narrative of the E&P industry and also this energy transition focus. And, obviously, you talked to more E&P and oil and gas producers than probably anybody worldwide. And so, given the commentary that you expect exceptional growth in a multiyear cycle in the oil and gas industry, this obviously leads you to believe that there's not going to be this under-investment going forward. So maybe if you can provide some color around this and thoughts around the disconnect between some investors’ perceptions that you're not going to see a reinvestment cycle going forward.
Olivier Le Peuch : I think the condition set is a unique combination that we are living with -- from the result of under-investment in the last 5 to 7 years combined with a reset that we have experienced in the industry during 2020, and also an elevated capital discipline, partly North America. When you combine this and look at the demand outlook that will surpass the GDP growth expected for the next 2 or 3 years, that will surpass the 2019 level sometime next year. I think the result of which will create a pull on international supply and will create a necessity for reinvestment in our industry. So the questions are very simple. There's an anticipated deficit of supply if there is no reinvestment in our industry. We have seen that many NOCs have signaled that they are set to reinvest in their capacity going forward. The IOCs are concentrating on their advantaged basins. They will not be the ones leading the growth in this cycle, but they would be the ones pursuing still the advantaged basin to generate the cash they need to transition to new energy. The independents are taking benefit of this position, have inherited some prolific assets and are redeveloping those assets with our support and the support of the entire industry to participate to the supply. So I think the conditions are set undoubtedly, that this demand will have to be met with supply and this supply cannot come with inventory, cannot come with only releasing the OPEC spare capacity. More will have to be built. Hence it will create activity growth in the coming years. And it's not only a short in 2022. This FID I talked about, this capacity expansion in Middle East are long-term projects that will have long-tail effects beyond the '22-'23 horizon.
Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Alright. That's perfect. Just 1 quick follow-up. Just some clarification on your guidance. Fourth quarter, I think you said flat margins. Was that flat consolidated margins or was that flat for each segment? In other words, if you run the mix could actually margins -- because of a favorable mix -- could margins be up?
Olivier Le Peuch : No, no. Chase, we don't disclose and we don't guide on down to the granular division. I think we're talking about a flattish margin, global margin, and in a sense maintaining very, very high-margin and exiting in the mid-teens globally for the Company as operating margins and the same level of EBITDA margin. So that's the -- what matters for us is the exit rate and the implication of this exit rate as we enter 2022 as a platform, as a foundation for margin expansion going forward. So the mix is giving us this result of flat or about mid-teens margin, and that's the ambition, and we are very proud of this -- maintaining this level of margins.
Operator: Our next question is from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase.
Arun Jayaram : Yes. My first question is, Olivier, there's 3 to 4 million barrels of productive capacity offline from OPEC. And as the cartel methodically brings back this output, call it in 4K BD increments. I wanted to get your thoughts, is this creating any near-term service opportunities for you? And I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on any shifts globally in spending from maintenance CapEx type spending, to growth and in productive capacity, oil and gas, and what this means for Schlumberger.
Olivier Le Peuch : Yes, I think the OPEC+ will continue to release this increment of oil to the market to be behind the supply curve, beyond the demand curve. But we are continuing to see an increase of intervention activity -- short-cycle activity that is starting to materialize in the OPEC+ countries where we are seeing mobilization of intervention stimulation as we have seen lifting and production maintenance activities. So that's the effect on short-cycle. This will also include a rig remobilization to do some infill drilling to start to support this increment of barrels for the country that has the capacity to expand fast. And this will turn into more long-cycle, as both the gas development is accelerating and you have seen the Jafurah announcement from Saudi and the continuation of a large gas in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as the commitment that 2 or 3 countries have taken in the Middle East particularly around the expansion of production capacity, permanent capacity towards the horizon of 2024-27, depending on the country. So what you talk about has an impact on short-cycle, but this is an underlying activity growth coming from long-cycle as well.
Operator: And our next question is -- Arun, do you have any follow-up? We'll move on and we'll go to line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh : Just on the first point here. I just wanted to return to Chase's question and just think through some of the dynamics in the fourth quarter here. So I would think with digital being an area that you called out as particularly strong in the fourth quarter, as well as some activity growth that you're expecting, it would seem, assuming that supply chain issues aren't getting worse, that you would naturally have some expansion in the margin in the fourth quarter. So I'm just curious, what I'm sort of missing in that framework. What's your -- what type of issues are you seeing or accounting for?
Olivier Le Peuch : No, it's a mix effect. I think you have to account for 2 effects: first, the production system that had some logistics and supply-related delay into delivery will have a sizable catch-up in the fourth quarter. And this segment where we are very happy with the double-digit margin and anticipate for margin expansion, this will be, in a mix, slightly dilutive to our margin overall. And that will offset some of the -- what you could expect from a digital fall through where we expect a strong end-of-year sales. But also you have to add to the mix the fact that you are in going into a seasonal effect in Northern Hemisphere and to lower mix of exploration and appraisal, that will have an effect and seasonality of Reservoir Performance. That is something that we -- that happens every year. And where the third quarter is typically the high-margin quarter due to this probable offshore operation mix, that decline for 1 or 2 quarters before it rebounds strongly every spring. So that's when you put this mix together, you result into maintaining the margin at the level we are putting, which is something remarkable and entering the 2022 on a high ground.
Connor Lynagh : That's helpful context, thank you. Second 1 is a higher-level question here. So you did have some integrated projects you disclosed in the press release. As we think about this portion of your business, I mean, it certainly has been characterized by yourself and peers as probably the later area where you were going to see pricing improvement. But I guess my question is effectively why? It seemed to me that the service companies that can really execute that kind of large-scale integrated work is a very short list, and it seems like there's a lot of value to be delivered to the customer from that type of contract. –So why isn't this an area that we should be more excited about over the next year or 2 here?
Olivier Le Peuch : Well, I think it has remained competitive due to the sheer size of this contract. But until the capacity in the market is stretched and is tightening, I think you will see that the market remains competitive in large integrated contract. But our capital discipline, the activity growing in all basins is set to create a condition for the tightening and hence, a lifting on the core pricing of our offering. Now, we are still very satisfied with these awards because we have demonstrated that we -- through integration, through performance, through technology, including digital and [inaudible], we have been differentiated in our ability to sustain our performance on those contracts and create the value we need to elevate the margins.
Operator: And next we have a question from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
Scott Gruber : You're feeling better about your mid-cycle, 25%-plus EBITDA margin target, which seems warranted given the backdrop here. But if I just look at consensus estimates, at least the market believes it would take you a while to achieve. So if you kind of extend consensus, assume 10% annual growth in '24, '25, extend the 30%-ish type incrementals, the market is forecasting in '22 and '23, it would actually take about 5 years to get to 25%-plus EBITDA margin. Do you think you can outpace 30% incrementals over the next few years and hit that 25% margin faster than 5 years?
Olivier Le Peuch : I think first it's not a matter of if but when we’ll hit and exceed this 25% EBITDA. We have been doing it. We have been delivering over 30% recently. The market condition as we foresee for -- going forward, as I’ve commented earlier, favorable with the right basin and operating environment mix that is favorable to our margin mix. Our technology adoption, performance through integration and digital operation, and accretive digital mix, I think, are putting the condition before pricing kicks in to give us the outlook, a positive outlook on this so that we will indeed ambition to achieve this before 5 years, clearly.
Scott Gruber : And do you think you can get there without much pricing? The pricing gains just always take a while to kind of move across discrete products into the bundled contracts and then kind of into your average selling price. Do you think you can get the other drivers and get there faster without much pricing?
Olivier Le Peuch : Some of the performance to-date, okay, pulling and elevating the performance of our Divisions to their highest level in 3 years or more and restoring to portfolio high-grading North America already proved that we can move our margins through execution, through performance, through high-grading visibly. So can we move forward? I think pricing will only accelerate the time by which this will be met. But we are still constructive that we will achieve this independently of pricing and that pricing will come as a bonus to elevate beyond 25%.
Operator: Our next question is we're going back to line of Arun Jayaram.
Arun Jayaram: So Olivier, year-to-date, you've reduced debt by about $1.5 billion. And I wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the priorities for free cash flow generation between cash return, the dividend, and the balance sheet, and also how you're thinking about Schlumberger's investment in Liberty now that the lockup recently expired.
Stephane Biguet: I’ll take this, Arun. Look, our immediate priority remains the deleveraging of the balance sheet. And yes, we've progressed quite well and we are very happy with its own. So now we do have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2x net debt-to-EBITDA target leverage, and we said we should do that by the end of 2022. With the earnings expansion, we are expecting in this growth cycle and our continuous focus on capital stewardship, yes, we will continue to generate significant excess cash in the next few years. So this will allow us to maintain a healthy balance sheet, and it will give us the flexibility to increase returns to shareholders, as well as fund new growth opportunities. As it relates to returns to shareholders, this is something we will continue to review with our Board of Directors as the cycle unfolds and the deleveraging of our balance sheet accelerates. And as it relates to new growth opportunities, we will -- whether it's in digital, New Energy, any new investment, we will continue to look at under the strict lens of our returns-based capital stewardship framework. Your question on Liberty. Clearly we are happy with the transaction we made now more than a year ago. We are benefiting from the recovery in North America through the significant appreciation of our equity stake there. And yes, monetization is clearly an option. The timing and the pace and the magnitude of this monetization will be based on the market conditions and the outlook. But we'll make sure we'll optimize it basically.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Reed: I guess I'd like to come back to the 25% margin goal for EBITDA but think of it maybe in a slightly different way. You’ve got obviously the typical cyclical recovery, so utilization, you'll get some pricing. You talked about digital as one of the big separating factors. And I was wondering if -- as you look at the goal of the 25%, maybe a weighting of where you think that could go if you thought what would be normal for utilization, normal for pricing, and then digital on top? Is it a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3? Is it 50-50? I'm just kind of curious how we should think about that coming through.
Olivier Le Peuch : I think it would be difficult to give you a precise outlook because this will depend on every division and almost on every geography, depending on a mix outlook we foresee. But suffice to say that I think our operating leverage will indeed be a base for margin expansion to the way we execute with efficiency using our own digital transformation to execute and extract performance from our execution. So that's the base. Above that, I will place the technology first and technology mix adoption from Fit-For-Basin that are highly differentiated and successful in all basins. I will include the Transition Technologies that are starting to emerge as a unique differentiator. And it will include also the integration delivery performance in integration contract. And then indeed, and you are correct, our digital expansion will be favorable on top. So I think you have these 3 things, but I don't want to be starting to be trying to create a boundary between these, I don't think is appropriate. And I think it will depend on every basin and every division will have a different trajectory, but we are confident that across the profile we have considering the international mix, considering the offshore, considering the technology adoption that is coming back, I think this -- we have the path forward.
Roger Reed: Okay, great. And then just an unrelated follow-up. I was curious, you talked about a lot of major projects and so forth. globally. We've seen obviously some pretty extreme pricing in LNG and natural gas overall. So if you just kind of looked at natural gas as a driver on the project side or the activity side, anything globally you could say? It looks like it's improved over recent months or recent quarters. Or anything on the sort of larger project side there (inaudible).
Olivier Le Peuch : Gas is there –for a long time as a critical supply, as a transition fuel as well. So I think you see that the existing reserves, be it on unconventional or conventional, offshore and onshore will be commercialized by our customers as long as they have a path to market through LNG or they have a path to market to pipeline. So we see this accelerating. You have seen some of the critical announcement we made this morning relating to onshore, offshore, –unconventional, and conventional gas developments and we see it as a trend that is not about to stop. Now, will it accelerate? I think the gas supply/demand is misbalanced this year, will recover a little bit next year, but will continue its strong trajectory going forward. And there are few countries that are committed to accelerate their gas transition. India is the most visible one, that will step change their consumption of gas and will then participate to fuel the gas demand and will itself expand in gas supply as well domestically. So Middle East, domestic gas, India as an engine of growth for gas beyond the current mix and some specific security supply that will trigger some gas development from existing gas, the redevelopment or short-cycle activity. So I'm optimistic, hence, very, very pleased with the gas contract we have been winning this quarter.
Operator: And our next question is from Waqar Syed with ATB Capital Markets.
Waqar Syed: Olivier, just 1 broader question. You've given us some good guidance on upstream capital spending for international markets and North American markets for next year. Now with respect to exploration budgets in particular, do you see the growth rate of exploration spending in line with otherwise global spending or higher or lower?
Olivier Le Peuch : It's too early to give a specific guidance for exploration. What I will say for exploration is that we are seeing 2 things coming back. We are seeing some seismic activity coming back, including there are some proof that the seismic boat utilization is going. But what is more critical is the near-field exploration is triggering more activity in exploration going forward as everybody wants to get better return on their existing infrastructure to create tieback. And hence, we have seen some licensing rounds as well. So licensing rounds, some seismic survey coming back, and exploration, near-field exploration for future infill or tieback is what we see. So to give you a magnitude directionally, it will increase, but to keep in mind it is too early.
Waqar Syed: Okay. And then, with respect to the APS business, previously, there were some plans for asset divestitures. Are those plans on hold or are you still pursuing those?
Stephane Biguet : Look, Waqar, for APS assets in Canada, which is what we discussed previously, we have received offers with various commercial constructs, and now we are just in the process of evaluating the potential merits and risks associated with those proposals. So this is what we are doing now. In the meantime, we are, of course, managing this asset as to optimize cash flows in the current commodity pricing environment, and it generates quite a lot of cash flow.
Operator: And next we go to the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: I just want to go back to Arun’s question on deleveraging. As you think about the right -- the optimal capital structure, is 2x net debt to EBITDA still the normalized way you would think about the business? And based on the visibility you have on the cash flow, when do you think you'll be in a position to hit that target?
Stephane Biguet : It's a good question, Neil. Is 2x the right level? You could argue it's a good level throughout the cycle. Now in an up-cycle with the cash you generate, the excess cash we would probably be happy to go below 2x, and it will give us the required flexibility, as I said, to look at growth, additional growth opportunities, and potential incremental shareholder returns. So we may not stop at 2x. We can take this as an intermediary step and we -- 2x will just be an average throughout the cycle, I think, is the right level.
Neil Mehta: Yes. The follow-up is just on the digital business. You spent a lot of time talking about it on this call, but do you think you'll -- the company will ever get credit for the digital business which is highly valuable, terrific margins, embedded within a more volatile services and technology business? Does the -- does that asset ultimately belong outside of your core business? And I look at Emerson and Aspen, the transaction that they recently did, try to put a better marker on the value of digital. It's a high-level question, but curious on what the optimal way to showcase the value of that business is.
Olivier Le Peuch : So first, we will continue to pursue. We have made investment into a digital platform. We are using it both internally and externally. We have critical customers that depend upon us and will continue to trust us for the future. So we are using it to accelerate our growth, be accretive on our growth and our returns. And whether we are getting the right value, I think it's up to you to review and give us the multiple expansion that we deserve for this. I think we have been, so far, demonstrating enough margins -- sustained margin. To this we anticipate the growth to now come to play visibly in the coming years. And I think our leadership in this is recognized. And yes, I would expect that this will be turning into a premium for valuation. I believe it's time to go. I'm not sure that we have time for another question.
Operator: No further time, you may conclude.
Olivier Le Peuch : So thank you very much. So I would like to conclude the call and I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, during the third quarter, our growth momentum was sustained, both internally, internationally and in North America and drove peer-leading margin expansion, reflecting our operating leverage, advantaged market position, and increased technology adoption. We also generated sizable free cash flow, allowing us to materially reduce our net debt. Secondly, our performance in execution, our proven integration capabilities, and our differentiated technology and digital portfolio are increasingly resonating with our customers and have resulted in sizable awards in the quarter across Middle East, offshore, and in gas development, in particular, all critical markets as the up-cycle unfolds. Thirdly, we're confident that the momentum of this up-cycle will continue allowing us to close this year with another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, resulting in full-year sequential growth internationally and pro forma North America, and full year margin expansion on the high-end of our guidance. Finally. with the backdrop of strengthening demand in the energy markets, the macro conditions are increasingly set for an exceptional multiyear growth cycle unfolding broadly during 2022, both internationally and North America and resulting in significant earnings growth potential for Schlumberger. Ladies and gentlemen, I could not be more satisfied with our strategy execution progress to-date, the enthusiasm of our entire team, and the elevated trust of our customers. I look forward to the coming quarters with increased confidence. Our returns-focused strategic execution has created the conditions for a unique outperformance in our core and digital offering at the onset of this up-cycle whilst elevating our sustainability commitment and accelerating our new energy strategic initiatives. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-24 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.
ND Maduemezia: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you ND, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics; our second-quarter results, the near-term industry macro environment and the outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Finally, I will share my perspective on how Schlumberger is positioned for sustained outperformance in this macro context. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions. Our second-quarter results demonstrated very broad strength in our core portfolio as we continued to fully capitalize on the short- and long-cycle activity recovery -- across Divisions, operating environments, and geographies both in North America and internationally. The combination of revenue quality, solid execution and vastly improved operating leverage delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. Let me share with you some performance highlights during the quarter. Internationally, the depth and diversity of our portfolio enabled us to take hold of the recovery in the second quarter, restoring margins to pre-pandemic levels ahead of the anticipated acceleration in these markets. In North America, we achieved our double-digit margin ambition, a key milestone in our 2021 financial targets. All divisions fully leveraged the activity recovery to post sequential topline growth and significant margin expansion, including Production Systems, which reached double-digit margins during the quarter. Growth and margin expansion were led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction, both posting growth internationally and in North America. Reservoir Performance growth was driven by the exploration and seasonal recovery, higher offshore activity and new technology adoption, all of which resulted in sequential margin expansion in excess of 370 basis points. Well Construction accelerated its rate of growth sequentially, outpacing rig count growth, both in North America and internationally, with strong contribution from offshore basins. In U.S. land, the Division grew more than 30%, double the sequential rig count growth rate over the quarter. This does not only reflect enhanced market participation, but also improving revenue quality. And cash flow finally from operation was $1.2 billion, enabling us to begin deleveraging the balance sheet this quarter. In addition to the impact of operating leverage, there were two contributing factors to this financial outperformance. First, the offshore activity mix; and second, technology adoption. The offshore rebound in the second quarter was led by high-single-digit deep water activity growth, particularly in Brazil and also included a mid-teens growth in exploration and appraisal activity across Europe and the Middle East. These market conditions presented a favorable mix and resulted in higher revenue quality for both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. In addition, as customers commit to future offshore development activity, we received significant deep water awards for our OneSubsea business line, resulting in a doubling of the booking volume versus the prior quarter and a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio exceeding 1.5. The other contributing factor is increasing new technology uptake. The rate of adoption of our latest-generation technology increased by one-third during the quarter and included, in particular, Transition Technologies, digital and fit-for-basin solutions, which benefited all Divisions and most basins. This is a clear recognition of the performance impact our technologies generate for our customers, and it gives us increased confidence in the contribution of technology adoption toward margin expansion in this upcycle. In addition, we continued to advance our digital and new energy strategies extending the reach of our digital platform with a number of key agreements and awards as customers forge ahead with their digital transformations. And in new energy, we continued to progress all of our ventures, including the recently announced strategic collaboration with Panasonic North America to develop our new battery-grade lithium production process in Clayton Valley, Nevada. Finally, during the second quarter, we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050. I'm very proud to lead the first service company that has set net-zero ambition that includes Scope 3 emissions. We have laid out an approach to climate change that is science-based, aligned with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target of the Paris Agreement, and is it built on a comprehensive near-term road map to achieve our goal -- with interim milestones in 2025 and 2030. As a company that prides itself on technology innovation, we aim to net the balance of emissions we produce in 2050 with carbon-negative actions. This plan also includes the launch of our Transition Technologies portfolio to support our customers on their journeys to net zero, such as the avoidance of flaring with Ora wireline technology and the track record [ph] of CYNARA CO2 membrane separation technology, as you have seen in this morning's release. Our net-zero ambition and the launch of Transition Technologies is an opportunity to contribute to the decarbonization of the industry, building through innovation, a resilient future that delivers higher value and lower carbon. Overall, I'm very pleased with our revenue quality, solid execution, enhanced market participation -- both in North America and internationally -- and most importantly the translation of all of these elements into another successive quarter of margin expansion. I want to thank here the entire Schlumberger team as they continue to execute and deliver outstanding performance for our customers and our communities despite COVID impact in several parts of the world. Next, I would like to share my view on the macroeconomic environment supporting our industry. While the rise of the COVID-19 Delta variant and resurgence of related disruptions could impact the pace of economic reopening, recent market projections continue to affirm an improving global economic outlook. Global GDP growth is now expected to approach 6% in 2021 and more than 4% in 2022, which will continue to drive a progressive recovery of oil demand. This outlook is supported by recent oil demand updates, which reflect the anticipation of wider vaccine-enabled recovery, improved mobility, and additional fiscal stimulus in large economies through the second half of the year. Looking farther out, the IEA projects that global oil demand will reach 100 million barrels per day and surpass pre-COVID levels by the end of 2022 in the absence of further policy change. If oil price are at elevated levels, the supply response to this demand recovery is developing broadly as anticipated. Indeed, this combination has resulted in a call on short-cycle production as well as an uptick in long-cycle projects reflected in new FIDs and encouraging recovery in both offshore developments and near-field exploration activity through the second quarter. In North America, this supply response is reflected in the rig count and frac fleet trends, with sustained strong growth through the first half of the year. Private operators led activity growth which resulted from the acceleration of DUC completions and increased drilling activity to replenish DUC inventory. By contrast, the embrace of capital discipline by the public operators is highlighted by the rig count still being significantly below the Q1 2020 total, despite WTI prices exceeding pre-pandemic levels. In this context, despite a solid activity growth outlook, we maintain our view that the North American market will be structurally smaller than in previous cycles as a consequence of capital discipline and industry consolidation. Moving to international markets, the deficit in investment needed to deliver the required oil supply represents a sustained growth opportunity, particularly in the low-cost, advantaged basins. We remain constructive on the structural pull on international supply and the resulting activity impact. This was already visible in the second quarter with a strong seasonal rebound and offshore recovery despite the impact of COVID disruptions in parts of Asia and in the Middle East. This also marked the second consecutive quarter of international rig count growth. Looking further out, we see favorable conditions for durable investment growth driven by the combination of actions by NOCs, internationally focused investment by public E&P operators and the expectation of continued supply discipline by OPEC+, all in response to the steady evolution of demand. The current pace of international tendering contract awards and increasing book-to-bill ratio support this view. Against this backdrop, Schlumberger is extremely well-positioned -- both in the international markets and in North America. Our market exposure is biased to accretive growth -- and with a series of new contract wins, our leading digital and fit-for-basin technology portfolio, and our performance strategy, we will create value for our customers and deliver industry-leading returns. Turning to the third quarter outlook, in North America, we see another quarter of growth, albeit somewhat moderating in U.S. land, led by private operators and horizontal oil drilling and a seasonal recovery in Canada. North America offshore will remain resilient, albeit with the hurricane season in view. Moving to the international markets, positive growth momentum is expected to continue through the third quarter across all areas. Short-cycle activity will be augmented by longer-cycle project startups. In this context, directionally, we expect our global third quarter revenue to grow by mid-single digits led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction Divisions, while our pretax segment operating margins should further expand by 50 to 100 basis points. With this outlook for the third quarter, we remain confident in achieving double-digit international growth in the second half of 2021 when compared to the second half of 2020. As a consequence, and absent further COVID setback in operational recovery, we now foresee full year revenue growth both internationally and in North America, when excluding the impact of divestitures With activity recovery ahead of us through the third quarter and strong signals of a durable recovery beyond that, we can now clearly see a path to the high end of our full year EBITDA margin expansion guidance for 2021. Looking farther ahead, the fundamentals remain very favorable, with a growing economic rebound, supportive oil prices and a demand and supply outlook all representing a set of unique conditions that will support an exceptional growth cycle. Furthermore, this cycle will be broad-based across geographies and operational environments, land, offshore, North America and particularly, international markets. The second quarter was a strong indication of the future outlook and a testament of our restored earnings power under these conditions. In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong second quarter results across our entire portfolio, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy in delivering our long-term financial ambition. I will now pass the call to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share was $0.30. This represents an increase of $0.09 compared to the first quarter of this year, and an increase of $0.25 when compared to the same period of last year, excluding charges. There were no charges or credits recorded during the first or second quarters of 2021. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $5.6 billion, increased 8% sequentially. North America revenue increased 11% sequentially, while international revenue increased 7%, both outpacing respective rig count growth. Pretax operating margins were 14.3% and have now increased four quarters in a row. This represents the highest margin since the fourth quarter of 2015. Notably, margins expanded sequentially across all four Divisions. This performance was driven not only by the seasonal rebound in the Northern Hemisphere, but also a favorable revenue mix as a result of increased offshore activity, new technology adoption and increased exploration and appraisal activity. Company-wide, adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.3% for the second quarter increased 118 basis points sequentially and is the highest since the third quarter of 2018. I am very pleased with this margin performance, which reflects the benefit of significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high-grading of our portfolio and our cost reduction program. This performance also gives me the confidence that we will continue to increase margins in the third quarter and beyond. Let me now go through the second-quarter results for each Division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $817 million, increased 6% sequentially, while pretax operating margins increased 147 basis points to 33%. These increases were primarily driven by strong digital solution sales. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.1 billion increased 12% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity, which resulted in international revenue increasing by 13%. Margins expanded 373 basis points to 13.9%, largely due to the seasonal recovery in the Northern Hemisphere and increased offshore and exploration activity as well as favorable technology mix in the Middle East and Africa. Well Construction revenue of $2.1 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins increased 209 basis points to 12.9%. These improvements were driven by strong performance both in North America and internationally. U.S. land revenue grew by over 30%, significantly outpacing the increase in rig count. International activity increased beyond the seasonal rebound as many countries experienced double-digit revenue growth. Finally, Production Systems' revenue of $1.7 billion increased 6% sequentially, and margins increased 146 basis points to 10.2%. These increases were primarily driven by higher activity in Europe, Africa and North America. Now turning to our liquidity, during the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations, and positive free cash flow of $869 million despite severance payments of $72 million. The amounts included a receipt of $477 million U.S. federal tax refund relating to prior years. This refund helped support our deleveraging efforts during the quarter. In this regard, our gross debt decreased by $861 million during the quarter. We have begun to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as demonstrated by the early redemption in June of all $665 million of notes that were coming due in September. We also repaid $236 million of commercial paper during the quarter. Net debt decreased sequentially by $632 million to $13 billion, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $351 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multi-client. For the full year of 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. In total, during the first half of 2021, we generated over $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and over $1 billion of free cash flow. These amounts are fully expected to increase in the second half of the year, consistent with historical trends. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit free cash flow margin for the full year of 2021 and beyond. This will allow us to continue to deleverage the balance sheet and provide us with flexibility in our capital allocation. One last item worth highlighting is that during the quarter, we replaced our EUR750 million credit facility with a new three-year EUR 750 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. The terms of this facility are aligned with the interim emissions reduction targets disclosed as part of our net-zero emissions commitment announced this quarter. This is a first for Schlumberger and further demonstrates our commitment to fully participate in the decarbonization of the industry. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. I think we are ready to open the floor for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James C. West: Hey, good afternoon, Olivier and Stephane.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.
James C. West: So Olivier, really strong performance and execution in the second quarter, kind of across the board and really strong margin performance, I thought. What's the sustainability of this type of margin improvement as we go through the back half of this year, and in particular, probably out in 2022 when things really get going and the cycle really takes off?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Thanks, James. You are correct. I think we are very proud of this margin expansion. I think there were several factors I will highlight first on the second quarter and then project how we believe we have sustainability of margin expansion. So first and foremost, I think the performance was led by revenue expansion, revenue growth. I think revenue growth has worked out to be at or ahead of our expectation both internationally and in North America. I think credit to our team, credit to the customer centricity, the new organization and our performance. Secondly, I think we have seen a significant effect of our operating leverage as well as operational efficiency playing in full light during the quarter, and we expect this to be the base of our margin expansion for the quarters to come. So, this was in full display in all divisions and has led to this significant margin expansion, particularly in the service-led Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. Thirdly, the revenue quality, as I recall it, was led by favorable activity mix coming from the seasonal rebound in some basins, some regions, and that included an offshore mix that was favorable to those two divisions as well as well as an exploration and appraisal uptick, mid-teens exploration and appraisal offshore quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter. So when you combine this, this is representing a revenue mix quality that I think is unique. This was supplemented by technology adoption, technology adoptions linked to our fit-for-basin solution for customers that are seeing success. Digital, as you heard during the remarks prepared by Stephane, and lately the new technology transitions -- Transition Technologies portfolio, a combination of which is creating revenue quality that is then impacting favorably our margin. Lastly and this was only noticeable in North America, we had a couple of green shoots on pricing, on Well Construction that is also starting to be recognized. So, to project this forward, I think the seasonal rebound will not always be there every quarter. The unique exploration and appraisal uptick mix that we got also will not repeat, but you can count on us to leverage the future growth in the industry, both in North America and internationally to seize the operating leverage and operating efficiency we have, the favorable mix and the technology adoption that should fuel our margin expansion going forward.
James C. West: Right, okay, good, it certainly provided a good glimpse into what the renewed earnings power of Schlumberger is. Perhaps if we could touch on Digital for a second, because it's kind of in a league of its own at this point. The technology adoption seems to be continuing to be strong and maybe accelerating. Margins were a little bit ahead of at least what we were expecting. What is your outlook there on the Digital side as we go through the next few quarters, especially again in 2022 and 2023?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think the progress we made this quarter was twofold. First, progress on our platform strategy. We continued to complete the platform foundations, the partnership, the enablement that give us extended market access such as what we are using from the IBM\Red Hat technology to access hybrid clouds and unlock, if you like, about one-third of the addressable market by this hybrid cloud and in-country solution we provide. And I think we have made much progress there, and I think we are in the eighth or the ninth inning, if you like, on the platform readiness for full scalability and expansion. And we made progress on the adoption of DELFI as you have seen some announcements, and we continue to progress on rolling out for accounts that have already adopted DELFI. Hence, our revenue on the DELFI and the new technology of digital was significantly accretive to our growth, significantly accretive to D&I, and resulted into margin expansion flow-through that was visible this quarter. So that will not continue to be the same every quarter. It depends on the seasonality and on the specific, but expect directionally to continue to grow.
James C. West: Okay, great. Thanks for that.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James.
Operator: And our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
J. David Anderson: Hi, good afternoon, Olivier. So clearly, we're starting to see the international upstream market starting to pick up, as you noted double-digit increases in many countries. I noticed you didn't mention Saudi, which I would expect to start to pick up in the coming months. So when do you think that piece falls into place? And how do you see the cadence for Middle East activity through the end of this year? And kind of what does that mean for '22 growth? I would think that kind of, at this point, I'd be surprised if growth wasn't up at least double digits internationally, especially with the positive commentary around offshore. Just wondering if you could comment, please.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. First, in short term, I would like to reiterate my positive commentary on the second quarter growth. It was all basins, all divisions internationally. So, it was broad and inclusive of Middle East. Now in the context of the Middle East in particular, the growth was maybe more muted or less aggressive and less accretive to the overall growth than other basins, and there are a couple of reasons for that. And the first and foremost reason is related to the supply constraints that are still outstanding on back and as such muting some of the short-cycle activity that we could have expected to rebound faster. So now going forward, there are a couple of factors that will play favorably short term and midterm. Short term, there will be a relief of some of these supply constraints that will continue to inch up the short cycle activity including Saudi. There is a commitment in Middle East for gas development. And I think Qatar was the first to expand their commitment, and we have benefited greatly from that rebound in activity for the last couple of quarters, and this will extend also to a couple of other countries, including Saudi. And lastly, as we turn into 2022, you have heard some signals from a couple of countries in GCC that have signaled that they will commit to production capacity increase to fulfill their opportunity to gain share as there will be a pull on international supply. So this will result from 2022 in combination of short cycle gas development, and long cycle across that region. And hence, they will catch up, and they will certainly be a region that will lead the activity growth and will support in second half our double-digit year-on-year H2 and next year into a strong growth going forward. Finally, if I have to make a comment on this, I think you may have seen some contract wins and contract award in Middle East. And we believe that on top of this activity growth, we have the potential to outperform and then getting a further tailwind to our growth going forward.
J. David Anderson: So if we look a little bit further out, you've kind of talked big picture about EBITDA exceeding 2019 levels with only about 50% of that lost revenue coming back. Just wondering if anything has changed in that view, either in terms of the timing of that growth coming -- that revenue coming back or the EBITDA level? Has anything sort of changed in that kind of longer-term view that we're thinking about?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Obviously, with the results we just delivered, we are increasing our confidence in our ability to reach and expand our margin going forward as the cycle unfolds. So starting with the next two or three years, we see now a strong case for a double-digit floor as an activity growth with an upside scenario. We see that the contract wins and the market position we have will benefit us to pull from this additional growth going forward. And the operational leverage, the activity mix including offshore and the technology adoption in doing digital will all create the condition, as I commented earlier, to expand our margins. So the ambition we have set to recover the net EBITDA dollar with less than half of the -- about half of the revenue recovery, I think, are still valid. And the mid-cycle ambition to expand the margin visibly is in full play.
J. David Anderson: Okay, thank you, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we have a question from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, everybody. I guess the first question…
Olivier Le Peuch: Hi.
Chase Mulvehill: Good morning, Olivier, first question, I just kind of wanted to ask about inflationary pressures. Obviously, supply chain seems to be tightening across the industry. We hear about raw material cost inflation. So maybe if you could just take a moment and talk about your ability to kind of control the supply chain and control cost or either pass along cost on the OFS side and also on the Cameron side as well.
Olivier Le Peuch: Now it's a very valid question, and it's something that we observe, and some facts and some trends that has materialized in some index -- indices going up. But I believe that the toolbox we have, and professional and very expanse organization we have in our planning and supply chain and manufacturing organization that are used to manage some inflationary pressure has allowed us to mitigate and hedge at this inflationary pressure and contain cost inflation into -- under our rules. Now when and as this happens and on the specifics of logistics or specific material, we are engaging with our customers using the contract terms we have, to leverage an adjustment, and we have done so successfully with several customers. So we are confident that the combination of our supply chain capability with global and local leverage and the customer-centricity engagement approach we have, ability to sit and discuss the commercial terms give us the ability to support this and continue to drive forward and expand our margins.
Chase Mulvehill: Awesome. And a quick follow-up here, probably for Stephane. When we think about free cash flow, obviously, it's going to be accelerating as you get into 2022. You'll be doing deleveraging, as you talked about, paying down some debt. But at what point should we think about incremental cash coming back to shareholders, probably a dividend bump first, and then maybe buybacks. But is there a certain leverage ratio that we should be looking at or thinking about you guys targeting before you kind of think about increasing it?
Stephane Biguet: Yes, yes, Chase, we do have a target leverage ratio at this stage. It is going down to less than 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Now with our strong cash flow performance and the EBITDA expansion, we are quite confident that we can achieve this target sometime by the end of 2022. Now we will, of course, need to continue investing in our core business to fully reap the benefits of this growth cycle, but this will be done with the same discipline we are exercising today and within the target range of 5% to 7% for the operating part of our CapEx, i.e., excluding APS and multi-client. Accounting for this, however, we will still generate significant excess cash flow throughout the growth cycle. This is, of course, very good news. It gives us optionality in our capital allocation, particularly to execute our strategy and to fund our new horizons of growth. Now whether it relates to our core portfolio or expansion into digital or new energy, any new investment will be looked at under the strict lens of our return-based capital allocation framework. Beyond that, indeed, we will continue to review our shareholder distribution policy based on the sustainability of cash flows and potential exceptional cash inflows, for example, proceeds from divestiture. So this is where we will take it.
Chase Mulvehill: Perfect. I'll turn it back over. Thanks everybody.
Operator: And our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good afternoon. Great quarter.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Scott.
Scott Gruber: So just as a clarification question to start, the 10% free cash conversion rate relative to revenues, we should be including the tax refund when we think about the conversion rate for the full year. Is that correct, Stephane?
Stephane Biguet: Yes, you should actually. But you have a few offsets, and not necessarily in the same quarter, but we continue to pay severance payments. I'm talking about offsets to the tax refund, Scott. So we continue to pay severance payments with the tail end. The process is finished, but there are still payments coming. So when you put all of it together, the tax refund is not fully a plus. Now excluding the two exceptional items going opposite way, tax refund and severance, we can actually still generate the 10% plus free cash flow margin. So we should be exceeding now that we have the tax refund for sure.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Got you. And then I was actually surprised to see the Well Construction share gains in the U.S., it's super impressive. Was that kind of a onetime catch-up just with high oil prices, customers now willing to pay up for your technology? Or do you see continued share gain potential onshore, whether it's Well Construction or elsewhere, even in light of private really driving the growth? Are you seeing gains with private? Just some color on U.S. share gain potential would be great.
Olivier Le Peuch: Absolutely, Scott, we are very proud of this achievement, and let me give you the three drivers for it, in terms of top line growth. First and foremost, performance in the way we execute, and I think has led to -- from cementing to drilling, directional drilling or bits market share gain with both private and with operators, public operators in the U.S. The second factor is that, as you remember, as part of our North America strategy pivot that we did initiate two years ago, we accelerated our technology access, giving access of fit-for-basin technology to some local DD company that are then using, renting or buying our equipment and using it to serve their local customers, mostly, if not exclusively, private. So this has been going quarter-on-quarter, and this is helping us to reach market and expand our market share beyond what we could do to our service arm. And finally, as I mentioned in one of my response earlier, we had some green shoots where our performance was in high demand, our directional drilling equipment was seen as unique to deliver the curve. Hence, we could extract some pricing premium. So the combination of these three have delivered this 30% plus quarter-on-quarter top line delivery, far outpacing the rig count growth. So there are some exceptional, as always, but I would expect that the dynamic and directionally this to continue going forward, particularly the market share gain.
Scott Gruber: Very impressive. Good to hear. Thanks for the color.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Next, we go to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: Yes, thanks. I wanted to ask about labor. Obviously, you had to take the challenging decision to reduce your workforce dramatically last year. I'm curious as we now look back towards growth, how well positioned are you to capitalize on the market demand? Do you have excess labor? Do you need to hire substantially? And I'm particularly curious in international regions where you may have some more long-cycle constraints on that.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, it's a very good question. It's something that we're working out to continue to make progress. But I think in a nutshell, I think the step change we did in some of the operational environment, our operational practice, including digital operation, has given us the opportunity to respond on the first peak of this cycle without deploying the same resource set as we have in the past, hence, getting direct efficiency gain as we mobilize and grow with the cycle. Going forward, and already initiated in some geographies where we had more than double-digit growth, as I mentioned, we had access to some resource that we onboarded during the quarter to respond to the contract we are winning. So the long cycle actually nature of international give us a bit more long-term visibility to this condition. Hence, our market approach is to target specific geographies and business line where we believe we can be generating accretive returns and growth and prepare for it by mobilizing ahead the resource or moving resource to address those. So I think we have a global access to talent. We are using a lot and at scale this remote operation. So it is a challenge for us to respond to high demand, but we believe that we have the operational environment to make it a success.
Connor Lynagh: Thank you. That's helpful context. Sort of a similar question, but on the steel or equipment side of things, basically, I'm wondering if you could, based on your expectations for how much activity will grow over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months, as you look in some of the more differentiated markets and more consolidated supplier markets, call it Middle East, offshore, et cetera, do you feel that there is adequate equipment to meet continued growth beyond that point? Do you feel the capacity will be tightening significantly? Just appreciate an update there. Thanks.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think in the early part of the cycle, I think we will use and the industry will use the excess supply that came from the compression of activity that came for the last two years. But again, we have very much professionalized our planning and supply organization. And I think from the Cameron to the asset that we have to deploy, I think we are trying to take a long-term view and scenario-based view on the future, looking beyond the 12-month horizon, and I'm starting to prepare and put some options so that we can respond to this growth going forward. Early part will not necessarily create a tightness, but the mid-cycle for sure, before the mid-cycle, this will create the condition for tightening supply and hence, some pricing conditions.
Connor Lynagh: Thank you. I will turn it back.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, team. The first question is around portfolio optimization. Perhaps you guys can weigh in on how you're thinking about the path for asset monetization, thinking Canada, maybe the Middle East? What are the opportunities? And how large could the asset sale market be for Schlumberger?
Stephane Biguet: So look, Neil, hi, we -- as it relates to the divestitures we disclosed last quarter, first, the APS asset in Canada, it's -- both are progressing as planned by the way. So in Canada, we have more than 10 parties actively looking at the information in our data room, and we plan to receive first round offers by the end of next month. Good news is that the economics keep on improving. So we are hopeful we can achieve a successful transaction. The Middle East rigs, likewise, progressing. We are negotiating with the shortlisted bidders. We have completed their due diligence, and it's going as planned. So I think really, these are the two divestitures that we have over equity positions where we have options for monetization in the future such as our Liberty stake, but this is something we will -- the timing and the magnitude we'll look at in due time.
Neil Mehta: Yes. Great. And then I would appreciate some of the comments you made on Saudi broadly, but maybe you could just step back and talk about OPEC+, including other regions within that cartel or in the plus side of OPEC. How are you seeing activity trends here? And what role do you think Schlumberger is going to play in terms of building out capacity that they are talking about?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, first, we have, I'll say, a privileged market position with most of the NOCs in this OPEC+ consortium. We have seen across the broad spectrum of these NOCs' activity starting to build back, seasonal rebounds playing strongly in Russia. And we expect, as I said, this short cycle to recover for the next two to four quarters as the demand will be lifted, as the constraints will be lifted, and we see that more than one or two country will actually commit to this capacity expansion. And we have the footprint. We have the relationship. We have the fit-for-basin to leverage and then to respond to this capacity buildup and this growth opportunity in those, from Russia to Middle East, particularly. So I feel confident that these market share pursuits, that as the market comes back from '22, '23 will be giving us an opportunity to leverage our market position and move up.
Neil Mehta: Thanks.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Yeah, good morning. Maybe just to follow-up to Neil's question on NOCs, I guess you're seeing some positive activity trends from the NOCs. And would you characterize these activities thus far as just more regarding sustaining capital requirements? Or are you seeing any potential mix shift in terms of increasing productive capacity? And again, we did note some increases, I guess, on the exploration side in terms of your revenue base.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think as I commented before, we have to distinguish first the gas and the oil market. And on gas market, I think the activity has been more sustained, and as seen in Qatar, a significant commitment to accelerate the North field redevelopment and expansion. So that has been very positive, and we have the benefit of that exposure. And the gas remained steady and supported elsewhere. On oil, you have a mix. But in short term, it's mostly a short cycle in anticipation of the supply constraints relief. And for two or three of the country that participate to the GCC, they have already made public commitments that they will expand, and they will participate at scale into the post rebalance, if you like, of the supply and then participate to the capture of international share of supply into 2023. So that will mean plan that will materialize from planning, from contract and from execution into 2022.
Arun Jayaram: Great, great. Olivier, you recently provided some longer-term outlook comments for new energy citing, call it, the 10% kind of growth CAGR as you helped your clients decarbonize. I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts on maybe the baseline for that long-term forecast and areas of your Transition Technologies portfolio that you're seeing perhaps the greatest traction as we sit here today.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Let me first clarify, and not mix in the same umbrella, the New Energy portfolio that we have developed with the purpose to create a new chapter beyond oil and gas to participate at scale to the energy transition from hydrogen to CCS and geo energy or lithium, as you have heard, from the Transition Technologies that we believe are very pertinent to the decarbonization of our oil and gas industry, helping our customers to reduce their footprint, CO2 footprint, to reduce their GHG emission. And in this context, we are focusing on flaring elimination or reduction, and you are using, in particular, the Ora wireline technology to avoid returning the fluids to the surface and burn and dispose through flaring and do the reservoir characterization and testing in situ, if you like. And that's a unique technology that has significant impact on both efficiency and on the CO2 footprint for everyone using it. And we are looking at methane emission detection and containment. And we are looking at, as you have seen in the press release this morning, also the CYNARA CO2 membrane that have superior performance for large acid gas treatment, if you want, to do CO2 sequestration and capture. So you have these two aspects. So the Transition Technologies will come more and more into play. And most of the customer I meet are asking us whether we can help them and have a conversation engagement on to methane detection, flaring or other techniques that eliminate or reduce significantly the footprint of CO2 on every operation on their Scope 3 upstream, if you like, in addition to their Scope 1 direct emission. And then -- and that will be part of our technology growth, technology adoption in the quarters to come. And then longer term, we will build on our New Energy portfolio that we are building. And then once we have -- continue to build this, we will grow at scale from hydrogen to CCS and [geo-energy] (ph) with Celsius for the heating and cooling of buildings to lithium production is the pilot that we are initiating, and the contribution from Panasonic give us the opportunity to do so. So these are two different avenue for growth short term and long term.
Arun Jayaram: Thanks for the fulsome answer. Appreciate it.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Tommy Moll: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
Stephane Biguet: Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning Tommy.
Tommy Moll: I wanted to start on your Digital & Integration margin. Your second -- your incremental this quarter was notably higher versus the trend and an impressive one at that. Fair to say that the full year for 2021 ought to be shaping up above the 30% type of range that we talked about last quarter. And then as you look beyond, is there any kind of through-cycle or normalized way you would frame the incremental margin opportunity for us there? Thank you.
Stephane Biguet: So look, Tommy, yes, it is shaping up to be slightly above the 30%. At this level, we are happy anyway with 30% in Q2. There is a bit of seasonality actually on software and maintenance sales, which are lower in Q1. So it's kind of normal to see a nice uptick between Q1 and Q2. So -- however, throughout the year on a full year basis, yes, we'll be a bit above 30% now. This is the kind of margins, which throughout the cycle, this is a fixed cost business. So as we accelerate the deployment of our digital solutions and the adoption improves, we could see margins increasing from there. So it's quite a healthy business, and this is why we are focusing on it basically.
Tommy Moll: Thank you. That's helpful. And I wanted to follow up with a big picture question on your New Energy strategy. If you think about from a strategic standpoint, you're the largest service -- you're the largest platform globally with the oil and gas incumbents. What if any, advantages does that confer on you vis-à-vis some of the smaller pure plays attacking some of these markets, the scale and the customer relationships that you have? And then if you also think about the other side of the equation where their cost of capital may, in fact, be much lower than yours, so you potentially have a different algorithm by which you decide how to allocate capital across these opportunities. So how do you think about when to put capital to work versus when the ask may be a little bit too rich and you're going to preserve your dry powder for another opportunity? Thanks.
Olivier Le Peuch: A very good question. I think first and foremost, I think let me highlight the, I think, two different, I would say, factor that will indeed leverage our current platform. First is the global deployment capability we have. We can industrialize and ship technology and deploy technology anywhere in the world, and we have done so for more than 80 or 90 years. And I think our ability to create franchise in every country from technology developed centrally or we develop locally, I think, is something that is unique, and I think that differentiates from many of the pure plays. The relationship we have and the customer base we have today will be occasionally, and I think will be the sense of the CCS where our customers have the opportunity to participate or in some of the downstream operation where they have a carbon capture or blue hydrogen opportunity could be an opportunity for us to continue to work with that customer base and expand. And at the same time, some of this company are turning into integrated energy company that will also participate at scale in the same market as we do. So that relationship will be useful, but I will more, I would say, highlight the global deployment capability. Now when it comes to capital allocation and capital deployment, I think it's very difficult to pinpoint too specific here. I think we will look again continue to mature this venture, prepare for scale as we start to, I would say, progress on our milestones, progress on our partnership and progress on the business model and the supply chain model that are quite different from the one we experience today. And then in that context, we'll make the appropriate capital allocation decision to be accretive to our long-term growth and to our returns.
Tommy Moll: Thank you. I appreciate it and I turn it back.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, our final question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchit: Thank you. Olivier, you mentioned the return to 100 million barrels of consumption and sort of a share shift from North America to international where the oil is coming from. I'm curious if you think that the international activity needs to surpass 2019 levels to deliver that much oil and what you think the time line is to get there.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think in short term, the rebalance will be mostly down to the release of the spare capacity that, I think, exists. Now if you look at the current production of the U.S., which is 1.5 million barrels or about below -- in U.S. land -- below what it was in early 2020, this gap has not yet been breached. And I think I do not expect this to be breached as we exit 2022. So there will be an increment of oil supply that we will pull on international market that the market can deliver today. But for sustainability in '23 and '24, the market will have to commit capacity. Hence, this is the reason why in Middle East and other country, you see this commitment of capacity. And this is the reason why you see the return of offshore and the commitment of FID. We have 50 FID about already to date. We expect to be 100 FID, most of them in offshore at the end of the year. This is 50% more than it was last year, and the trajectory is towards 150 -- another 50% increment after that. So now going forward and expanding beyond, I would expect within the next two to three years, obviously, with this dynamic and the pull on the international supply will create the floor of activity to reach and/or exceed the level of 2019 activity within that time frame.
Marc Bianchit: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Separately, on -- you mentioned APS a couple of times in the press release. It sounds like maybe activity has ramped a bit in Canada, where you have a bit more oil price exposure. I'm just curious how investors should think about the sensitivity to oil price from APS at this point. And then if you do have a successful transaction and sell the business, just how material of a shortfall in cash flow would that create just vis-à-vis what we're seeing right now?
Stephane Biguet: I'll take these questions. So look, the -- actually, the activity itself didn't really change, and activity here is more measured in terms of production, of course. So we did have a bit of a nice windfall on increased WTI in the second quarter from our Canada asset, but it's -- in the grand scheme of things, it's not material. In Ecuador, by the way, at this level of WTI, our tariffs are either fixed or when they are variable, they are capped. And we have passed that cap. So there is little sensitivity to oil price at this level besides Canada. Now it makes it a very good time to actually monetize our assets, right? It's -- it has generated cash flow lately because of the oil price and the investment level we put in there. Historically, it's an asset that requires quite a bit of CapEx. And so when we close the transaction, we shouldn't see a big impact on our cash flow, and we'll get, of course, hopefully, very good proceeds from the transaction.
Marc Bianchit: Wonderful. Thank you very much.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Operator: Speakers I'll turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much. So to conclude the call, I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, the second quarter results clearly demonstrate both the strength of our market position -- particularly internationally, with sequential growth in all Divisions and Basins -- and our significant operating leverage, resulting in more than 200 basis points of operating margin expansion internationally with all Divisions contributing significant fall-through. Second, the activity and customer trends observed during the quarter reinforce our conviction in an increasingly favorable outlook with a broad recovery across all basins and operating environments and with a much improved contribution from new technology adoption. Third, and absent further COVID setbacks impacting activity or economic rebounds, we are confident that the momentum for this upcycle -- both North America and internationally, will continue during the second half of 2021 and will lead to another quarter of growth and margin expansion. As a consequence, we remain confident in our second half guidance shared previously for international growth and have increased our confidence in our full year margin expansion and cash flow generation. Finally, as we look further ahead, the conditions are set for an exceptional growth cycle in response to the call for supply in 2022 and future demand growth in subsequent years. This will increasingly favor international supply impacting land and offshore, short and long cycle globally. Ladies and gentlemen, our returns-focused strategy, international footprint, digital, decarbonization, and new energy strategic initiatives are highly differentiated, and we support our outperformance ambition throughout the cycle and beyond as we continue to write a new chapter for the company. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-23 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.
ND Maduemezia: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer, and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected, in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics: our first-quarter results, our progress on our performance strategy, and finally, our outlook for the second quarter and second half of the year. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions. The first quarter of 2021 was a strong step forward. The quarter unfolded as we anticipated, with acceleration in North America activity and momentum continuing to build in the international markets, aside from the usual seasonal effects. We executed very well within that context. We expanded our global operating margins for the third consecutive quarter, and free cash flow was once again solidly positive.  Here are some highlights in support of this performance: Well Construction sustained growth sequentially, and in North America outpaced U.S. land rig counts, demonstrating enhanced market participation in the recovery. Reservoir Performance grew, when adjusted for the OneStim divestiture. Digital & Integration delivered another strong quarter with resilient margins, on track for our full-year targets.  In North America, execution of our returns-focused strategy drove strong margin expansion fully aligned with our double-digit margin targets.  And in international markets, despite severe seasonality and relative exposure in Russia and China, we continued growth across geographies. In this environment, and as the industry prepares for an upcycle, performance matters. And decisions on contract awards and capacity allocation are increasingly driven by technology and execution.  We were very pleased with the outcome of several international multiyear contract awards, specifically in Middle East and in offshore, building a pipeline that will support growth in 2022, and beyond. We are determined to drive performance differentiation, leveraging our fit-for-basin technology and digital capabilities. This combination benefited our integration performance, with our largest LSTK operations achieving a 6% improvement in drilling efficiency during the quarter.  This strong start to the year, characterized by resilient revenue, sequential margin expansion, and positive free cash flow, positions us very well, to meet our full-year financial ambitions and to deleverage our balance sheet. I want to congratulate the entire Schlumberger team, who delivered strong execution for our customers, having positioned us for the growth that is now underway. Next, I would like to comment on three elements of our performance strategy that present further opportunities for growth in this upcoming cycle and beyond, digital, sustainability and Schlumberger New Energy. Starting with Digital—18 months ago, we stated our ambition to lead the digital transformation in our industry and to significantly grow new digital revenue streams. I want today to update you with our progress. Our digital strategy is a platform strategy, leveraging unique and open platforms: DELFI, OSDU, and Agora. Since launching our core DELFI platform, we have significantly expanded its market reach, from Google Cloud, to Microsoft Azure, and more recently, using IBM Red Hat technology to enable hybrid cloud and offer fit-for-basin cloud solutions, as highlighted this morning in our collaboration with Yandex.  We'll continue to execute on this platform journey, to expand the choice for our customers, and to support our three digital business streams; workflow, data, and operations.  First, we offer our customers the opportunity to transition their technical workflows, from the desktop to the cloud, to realize productivity gains from DELFI workflow integration, collaboration, and access to scalable cloud computing. Our market leadership on the desktop position us very well to capture this market. In the last 18 months, our customers have increasingly transitioned to the cloud, resulting in 50% growth in our contract backlog, and a 10-fold increase in full-time DELFI users. As we expand our cloud-native application, and enable additional workflow within DELFI, we expect increased adoption across our customer base, resulting in steady growth of our digital workflow revenue. Second, recognizing that data is the key to unlock the industry digital transformation, we worked with the industry OSDU Forum to open source and contribute the underlying DELFI data ecosystem, helping to establish OSDU as the industry standard, an essential step to liberate data at scale for AI applications and to enable multi-vendor interoperable workflows. In this context, we recently partnered with Microsoft to offer Azure customers access to our OSDU Enterprise Data Management Solution. We will augment this offering with additional AI capabilities, and will also expand our geographical reach. The market potential for this data business stream is very significant as it underpins every customer digital transformation, as exemplified by our recent announcement with Equinor. Third, our customers’ operations represent a unique opportunity to realize the promise of asset and field digital solutions. We designed an open IoT platform, Agora, to enable edge applications, complementing our DELFI platform operational workflows, and integrating with our partner, Sensia. Using Agora and DELFI, we are deploying digital operation solutions for drilling and production, both with our customers and as part of our integrated projects. This digital offering can significantly impact our own operations as was demonstrated this quarter in the Ecuador project and in our main LSTK operations, and also greatly benefit our customers. Our ambition is to establish critical market share in this white space, and accelerate collaboration with industry partners to further its adoption. These three digital business streams—workflow, data, and operation, built on open platforms are supporting our digital growth ambition. We are very pleased with the progress on our platform foundation with the adoption by a broad set of customers, and are confident in the success of each business stream as we execute our roadmaps. Moving now to sustainability, we are strengthening our commitment to action, particularly as the industry faces the decarbonization mandate, and world leaders have reaffirmed commitments or advanced stronger goals in recent days. As it relates to climate action, this goes beyond reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions as we believe there is a significant opportunity for our technology and operating practice to decisively impact and accelerate the industry's decarbonization efforts as well as contribute towards emission reduction goals around the world. Our technology portfolio includes solutions that help our customers eliminate flaring, reduce fugitive methane emissions, and leverage automation and digital surveillance to reduce environmental impact. This technology focus on low carbon impact will be an increasing element of differentiation for Schlumberger in the future. An example that resonates with our customer is the complete electrification of offshore pollution systems. As outlined in our earnings release with the bp project for subsea electrification. This is the next offshore frontier and it will also pave the way to full digital enablement.  Beyond our industry, our CCS partnership with LafargeHolcim and the bio energy CCS project in Mendota, California are examples of cross sector initiative aligned with climate actions. Specifically, in Schlumberger New Energy we reached milestones in the sectors where we are participating across the energy transition: hydrogen, lithium, CCS, geothermal, and geo energy.  During the quarter, we established and accelerated new ventures, formed strategic partnerships, and gained market exposure, and are progressing in de-risking technology for up scaling.  We will continue to build out the New Energy portfolio throughout the year. And, we will keep you updated on our progress. We are extremely proud of the tangible results we have realized in only a short time, as it clearly outlines the power of the Schlumberger brand and the potential of this new chapter for the future of the company. Turning to the outlook, upward revisions in global economic forecast -- growth forecast by the IMF and positive demand forecast adjustment by both IEA and OPEC reinforce the transition into a demand-led recovery, which will strengthen through the second-half of 2021, absent new setbacks on vaccination rollouts or easing of lockdowns. Against this backdrop, we are increasingly confident in our full-year activity outlook. In North America, in the second quarter, we see sustained activity growth in U.S. lands, and a seasonal rebound in North America offshore being partially offset by the Canada breakup. As our first quarter results have shown, particularly in Well Construction, our new mix and sizeable exposure in the North America market will increasingly contribute to our results. Moving to international markets, activity growth will broaden in the second quarter with the seasonal recovery in Russia and China augmenting the continued growth in Africa and Middle East while Latin America should remain resilient. In addition, the offshore recovery will continue in the second quarter including the gradual return of exploration and appraisal in key international markets. The depth and divestiture for international franchise give us great exposure to these market expansions, especially in well construction and reservoir performance which will lead in the second quarter. More broadly, we anticipate all Divisions to grow sequentially at different pace. And margin expansion to be led again by reservoir performance and well construction. In light of this, directionally, we expect total second quarter revenue to grow in mid-single-digits and our operating margins to further expand by 50 to 100 basis points. Looking further into the second-half of 2021, in North America the pace of growth is expected to moderate on budget exhaustion and seasonal effects, but could surprise to the upside resulting in full-year growth when excluding the impact of divestures. In the international markets, our confidence in the second-half outlook has been strengthening based on the latest international rig count trends, CapEx signals and customer engagements. International activity will broaden and accelerate in the second half impacting short to long cycle both on land and offshore including deepwater in the most advantaged offshore basins. The magnitude of this leading indicators combined with upward revision to global economic growth and demand recovery present the potential for an even stronger inflection than initially anticipated for the second half of the year. Therefore, we have greater confidence in the previous guidance of a double digit increase in international revenue in the second half when compared to the same period last year. And absent of a setback in the post economic -- post pandemic recovery we foresee an upside for full-year growth internationally, resulting in a stronger footing as we enter 2022. In the context of this top line growth and the steps we took to reset the earnings power, we're confident that we'll fully realize our operating leverage to deliver our full-year ambition of 250 to 300 bps margin expansion year-over-year. We expect to continue expanding margins during the recovery to support increasing cash flow throughout the year, which will provide subsequent deleveraging opportunity. Now, I'd like to pass the call to Stephane.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share was $0.21, there were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the charges and credits recorded in the previous periods, this represents a decrease of $0.01 sequentially and $0.04 when compared to the first quarter of last year. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $5.2 billion decreased approximately 6% sequentially. However, if we adjust for the OneStim and artificial lift, low-flow divestitures which were completed during the fourth quarter of last year, revenue was essentially flat sequentially despite the first quarter seasonality. Excluding the impact of divestitures, North America revenue increased 10% sequentially, reflecting significant activity increase on land partially offset by lower product sales offshore. International revenue declined only 3% sequentially despite the effects of the extended winter period we experienced in Russia, and the usual seasonality in that the Far East. Pretax operating margins were 12.7% and have now increased for three quarters in a row. In addition, pretax operating margins were 230 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year. This represents the highest margin since the third quarter of 2019. This strong margin performance reflects the significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high grading of our portfolio and our cost-out program which is now essentially complete. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.1% for the first quarter were flat sequentially as the positive impact of the OneStim divestiture was offset by the seasonal effects we typically experience in the first quarter. EBITDA margins were 203 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each Division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $773 million decreased 7% sequentially driven by seasonally lower sales of digital solutions and multi-client licenses. Margins only decreased by 37 basis points to 32% as the effects of the digital solutions and multi-client revenue declines were largely offset by improved profitability from APS projects. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1 billion decreased 20% sequentially. However, excluding the impact of the divested OneStim business revenue increased 3% despite seasonally lower revenue in Russia and China. The revenue growth was driven primarily by higher activity in Latin America and the Middle East. Margins increased 260 (sic) [261] basis points to 10.2%, largely due to the divestiture of the OneStim business that was dilutive to the Division's fourth quarter margins. Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 4% sequentially and margins increased 103 basis points to 10.8% due to increased activity in North America land and Latin America. This growth was partially offset by the seasonal slowdown in drilling activity in Russia and China. Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 4% sequentially. International revenue declined 4% while North America was down 3%. Despite the revenue decline margins only decreased 71 basis points to 8.7% as a result of cost measures, as well as improved profitability in Midstream production systems due to higher activity. Now, turning to our liquidity, during the quarter, we generated $429 million of cash flow from operations, and positive free cash flow of $159 million, despite severance payments of $112 million, and the increase in working capital requirements, we always experience in the first quarter due to the annual payout of employee incentives. Our cash flow will improve throughout the rest of the year, consistent with our historical quarterly trends. Our net debt at the end of the first quarter was $13.7 billion, a decrease of $207 million when compared to the end of the previous quarter. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $270 million. This amount includes CapEx, investment in APS projects and multi-client. For full-year 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. On that note, let me take the opportunity to provide you with a quick update on our capital stewardship program. Optimizing the allocation of our capital investments will be critical to maximize the benefits of the ongoing activity recovery, which is poised to accelerate in the next few quarters. As part of the company's reorganization, we implemented a new capital allocation framework that governs all types of investments. The underlying principle behind the framework is that investment opportunities are prioritized based on returns and cash flow before any other metric. At the corporate level, this framework allows us to critically assess our technology portfolio and rationalize our offering to reduce capital intensity and maximize returns. At the Division level, we have strengthened our processes to ensure that new assets, as well as existing assets, are deployed where they will generate the highest returns. We are also leveraging this capital discipline to drive commercial behaviors and improve the quality of our revenue. With this in place, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit cash flow margin -- free cash flow margin for the full-year of 2021, and beyond. This will allow us to deleverage the balance sheet, which remains a top priority for us. It is worth noting that during the quarter, the two major credit rating agencies confirmed our long-term credit ratings of A2 and A, respectively. Both cited our expected strong cash flow profile and our commitment to deleveraging. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. So, I believe that we are ready to open the floor for the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning, Olivier and Stephane.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.
James West: So, Olivier, great to hear your increased conviction about international top line growth in the second-half of this year, I'd love to hear or understand how you're thinking about the slope or shape of that recovery, and then really, as it relates more so to '22 and '23, which I think will be very important years?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, thank you, James. I think, first, I think I believe it's clear that we are about to enter demand-led recovery. And I think the macro factor, both economic growth and what we are seeing, indicates that the oil demand recovery will reach 2019 level by or before the end of 2022. In this context, I believe that we are ready and starting at, and during the second-half of this year, facing the beginning of demand-led recovery that will trigger multiyear recovery cycle and industry upcycle. In this context, if you look at the recent period of underinvestment, look at the structural constraints in North America due to capital discipline, I believe that this will create the condition to create a significant pull on international supply. So, this will support international supply activity buildup, not only at the end of this year, but well into '22 and '23. In addition to this, I believe that the offshore, being a unique market, it's a privileged market for IOCs, some NOCs, and focused independents, will also see a gradual but very strong recovery over the long term. It is -- the offshore advantaged basins represents an extremely good oil production plateau for some basins at low carbon footprint. So this will support also the long-term international recovery. So, we believe -- we believe really that we are very well-positioned to outperform in this macro, because we believe that this macro outlook, that would include a growing international mix, including offshore, will play very well to our strengths. In addition, we have accelerated our strategy transformation, both the organizational transformation and key strategic elements, that will place very well from efficiency performance focus from our capital stewardship, our fit-for-basin that is resonating very well for our customer, and finally, for our digital and decarbonization strategic focus we have put in. So, I believe that we are seeing the beginning of this multiyear growth. We are also seeing that our performance strategy is resonating very well for our customers. And we have been awarded several multiyear contracts that are creating the backlog we need to support this growth going forward. So yes, I'm optimistic, not only on the second-half of this year, but on an accelerated path in 2022, and a long-cycle strength, including offshore, in '22, '23, and beyond.
James West: No, that was very clear, Olivier. Thanks for that. Maybe the second, the follow-up for me is on the margins. You've had good margin progression in the last two or three quarters. How do you think about sustainable margin progression and expansion as the recovery takes hold?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think going forward, James, as we enter this industry upcycle, I believe there are three elements that will favorably impact our margin expansion. First, I think is the -- as I described, is the very favorable macro outlook, that combined with the pace of international growth, the offshore elements, and also, as we are starting to see this quarter, the return of exploration and appraisal activity that is still needed to replenish the reserve. And also, that is becoming more near-field exploration, close to the offshore hubs in particular. So, these factors are very favorable. Secondly, I believe that we have created quality revenue initiatives as part of our initiative. First, fit-for-basin; fit-for-basin technology is creating the premium that differentiate us in some critical basin, in some critical assets, and give us the premium for revenue quality improvement. Similarly, I think our technology access, as we have seen in North America, has played a great role in helping us to expand market, but also to command premium with our technology partner. And finally, the success of Digital will be accretive over the period to this. So the third element I think beyond this strategy, I think is the step change we expect to materialize into our integration contracts, from a performance efficiency using Digital, as we have demonstrated already, using fit technology, and using practice that are becoming best-in-class. So, we believe that these three elements, the backdrop, the key element of our strategy for revenue quality, and the enhanced margin on our integrated contract will all combine to create a condition for further margin expansion, and acceleration of our margin expansion going forward.
James West: Excellent, thanks, Olivier.
Operator: And our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hi, good morning, Olivier. Just want to follow-up on the discussion around the Middle East. You talk about robust growth in Saudi and Qatar this quarter. Really seems to be kind of first tangible signs of international inflection. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that performance during the quarter, and whether or not those were new contracts starting up or existing contracts starting -- coming back on. But more importantly, I was wondering if you could just talk about the types of tenders that are being discussed in the Middle East? And do you see projects that would be expanding capacity in the region? And also, do you think this will be more project management work, I think you had talked about LSTK kind of doing a little bit better this quarter. Do you think that's going to be a bigger part of the mix going forward?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, first, to comment on our growth in Middle East. Indeed, we had sequential growth in Middle East during the quarter. And I think this was led by, indeed, Saudi and Qatar to a large extent. And these were due to two factors, Qatar, I think, is our market position combined with the activity growth have resulted into activity. In Saudi, I think it's more related to performance, and activity share awards that resulted from our performance in execution in the quarter. And I think we see these factors of a strong market position we have of performance differentiation to help us go forward. So that's to maybe support and substantiate what we see going forward. In addition to this, as we have seen from last quarter to this quarter, we did announce some critical awards that are securing or expanding this market position in Middle East. Now, there is a lot of LSTK some of our peers have talked about large and very large contract tenders underway. So, I cannot and will not comment on this as these tenders are underway, but what can I say is that the activity is rebounding, the activity outlook both land and offshore Middle East will be strengthening. So, our customer are indeed securing capacity and looking for best performer and looking for, in a sense, the condition that would make them successful in their ambition to augment their capacity and augment the production going forward. So, it will be performance that will matter most in the future. For me, in my opinion.
David Anderson: It makes sense. My other question is on the digital side. You made a lot of progress over the last year, establishing a footprint with your -- with the platform with DELFI across a lot of IOCs and NOCs, I believe Chevron is actually even implementing across the Permian. So, it feels like you're kind of where you want to be in terms of your footprint. It was interesting to hear you talk about the three elements of the workflow, data and operations. So, I'm just wondering if you could just maybe expand a bit on how you see each, the pace of growth in each of those. And what is that dependent upon? Partly I'm wondering is it, customers as getting more comfortable in using digital and day-to-day operations, but do you also need to build out new software applications or maybe it's just something else?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, first I think it's clear that we need to recognize the industry as it has gone out of this crisis and turn into a new landscape as realize that digital is a tenent of the future. And digital is here to impact efficiency performance, and to make this industry more resilient for the long term. So first that has been a catalyst in the last 18 months that accelerate the adoption of digital that's the first. We believe that our platform strategy is being recognized, accepted, and across different customer type from national oil company to independent, to the IOCs. As you have seen, there is a large adoption of this, because we have kept this platform open. Now, when it comes to the pace and growth factor that differentiates workflow, data and operation, I believe that workflow is the one that is the most mature, because it builds on our existing desktop market leadership we have, and here we are transitioning the existing customer base we have towards to cloud. And each of them is realizing the power of the cloud from productivity, from collaboration, from access to scalable cloud computing. We simply need to reassure them that our platform is open and that they can make the choice their choice on the cloud infrastructure, which we are doing. The second, data, I think is renaissance of the data market that used to be a major market in digital 20 years ago. Everybody realized that without the data, we cannot unlock the power of digital transformation. So thankfully the industry has come together and has created, its OSDU platform Open Subsurface Data Universe driven by the Open Forum. And we have been fortunate to technically contribute our DELFI ecosystem to this. So on that foundation, every company will have to roll out and we'll certainly use the opportunity to roll out OSDU as a platform so that it unlocks the data access, liberate the data and then data provider, and then service provider, a consulting company, and the customer themselves will tap into these data using AI application. And this is where we want to participate, both the data transition to this new platform and the AI opportunity upon this. Finally, operation. Operation is the the biggest prize long-term, but also the most difficult to realize because every asset, every infrastructure on the field, every infrastructure on the edge is different. So while we believe that there is an immense opportunity to use digital in operation, and we are doing it very successfully, internally, the complexity, the system integration needs and the fit-for-purpose digital deployment will slow down. The adoption of this. Yet we'll make progress and we'll continue to partner with other companies to make sure that we offer integrated offering to the industry. When you combine these three at the different pace of growth, you create the condition for multiplicity of revenue stream that we support double digital ambition that we’ll realize within the decade.
David Anderson: Thanks for the information. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning everybody. I guess first thing I wanted to hit on was kind of New Energy, so I don't know if maybe at a high level, could you take a minute and talk to how Schlumberger is viewing the New Energy environment and what are the key highlights of your New Energy transition strategy? And it actually would be great if you could lay out the prospective roadmap as Schlumberger embarks on this New Energy transition journey?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, great question, Chase. I think as you have seen, we've decided to enter a new chapter for the company and the way we decided to go after this is to first identify and selectively the domain in which we believe we can leverage our strengths. The subsurface can leverage our strengths, our technology, and global footprint to create and forge partnership, technology, acquisition, or organically grow the domain. So first we have decided to explore and establish market position and diversify our market entrants into this domain. So, you have seen that we have in parallel from lithium to CCS, from hydrogen to geo energy and geothermal created ventures, each of them with potentially a different partner for addressing different industry sector, so that we diversify not only our approach, but diversify and expand our market reach. So that has been the first is to make sure that we diversify our investments, diversify our market approach and our type of partnership. So that has been our first, I would say, a framework that we have used to develop this. Now, what is ambition, there, ambition is to create the future of the company in the long run. So within the decade and within the next two or three years specifically, we will the risk and scale this technology investment these venture investments, working with our partners, working internally to develop those technology as we are for green hydrogen as well with our CCS Mendota bioenergy plant or with LarfargeHolcim for CCS on cement plant. We will work, develop, embark into ventures where we will de-risk enhance, and then when it is derisked at scale, we'll then make bigger investments, large investments that will then support the long-term growth.
Chase Mulvehill: Perfect. And there is a quick follow-up to James first question around international, you mentioned that 2019 -- next year, we can kind of get back to 2019 levels. So I guess my question would be 2019 was pretty tight and you were starting to see some pricing. So if we get back to 2019 levels next year, like what could this mean for pricing? And when we think about the full international cycle, could we actually see a real pricing cycle unfold internationally as a recovery gains momentum?
Olivier Le Peuch: First, I think our push to do this is first and foremost performance. We believe that performance creates the revenue opportunity, the revenue quality and the margin expansions we believe that are the foundation of our strategy. So, now whether the market capacity in some basin for some specific business line we create the condition for pricing. I believe it will. But again, you will depend on how do we differentiate for performance. How do we make sure that our technology is unique and is in high-demand and create conditions for the customer to accept to a premium on this technology and that's our approach. Now whether the capacity will create in a short-term global pricing, I don't think it will, certainly in the coming quarters, create pricing inflection on some business line in some basin, we are already seeing it today in North America for very specific Well Construction technology that is in high demand and the amount of premium.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. Appreciate the color, Olivier…
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: And next we go to line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes, Hello.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: Good morning. So the D&I margin at 32%, super impressive. How should we think about incrementals for that segment over the course of the year by definition, they obviously need to be healthy given the starting point, but what's a reasonable range and relatedly, and as you get deeper into these digital management contracts with customers, obviously profitability improves over time. Would that be a material driver during the rest of the year, or is that incremental margin bets that more in 22 and beyond?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. First, I think we provided a guidance for full-year margin at 30%. And I think you have seen that the way we started the year is putting us on an excellent footing to realize that margin outlook, and this margin comes from two major factors. One is the performance of our integration contracts, and secondly, the strength and margin of our digital business. Now, going forward, and rolling into the later part of the year obviously, the digital will gradually start to improve its size and we'll create and generate the fall through that we believe will support this 30% ambition and could, as we exit 2021, clearly outperform and us on a better opportunity for margin expansion into 2022. So over time long-term the digital will indeed grow and we share that ambition there and we will clearly help continue to support these impressive margins and possibly expand it further in your long-term.
Scott Gruber: Got you. And just shifting gears a little bit and maybe somewhat premature to ask, but it just given that the international recovery outlook is strengthening and obviously the capital intensity to your portfolio is now on the decline. How do you think about the use of free cash flow, is the focus purely on building cash and deleveraging, what conditions would you look forward to start enhancing the cash return and as we move deeper into the recovery, is there a preference for dividend enhancement versus buy backs, when the time is right to return cash?
Stephane Biguet: So, I'll answer that question, Scott. Yes, you said that our immediate priorities is indeed to deleverage the balance sheet. At the same time, we want to make sure that we can sustain growth in our core business. Of course, even though our capex intensity has reduced quite a bit compared to the past, but we also need to leave enough capacity to execute our strategy, particularly as it relates to new horizons of growth. So, in any case, whether it relates to our core business or white spaces as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, any new investment will be looked at under the strict lens of our return-based capital allocation framework. And beyond that, yes, once we are filtered on this project, we will return any excess cash to our shareholders for either dividends or stock repurchases. We do not have a prescribed split between the two. It will depend on the conditions at that time. The time we have to make the decision and in particular, the sustainability of cash flows.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Thanks. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Sean.
Sean Meakim: I appreciate the commentary on the outlook for the Middle East. Maybe just to follow-up, can we talk about the legacy margin dilutive LSTK contracts? Just to what extent have you been able to mitigate some of the challenges there? They're now a few years old. I was just curious to what extent does a contract roll create an opportunity for resetting the margin impact for those contracts maybe in the medium term?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think as you know for the last two years, I think we have been increasing our focus management and operational focus on resolving or improving this highly dilutive contracts that there were two or three years ago. And I think we have made great progress. I think whether they are exactly where I would like them to be, and accretive to the overall margin, maybe not, but I think we have made progress in three directions, first, in engaging our customer and making them realize the complexity and providing the support to execute this contract with better support and eliminating or mitigating some risk. Secondly, by adopting an accelerating adoption within this compact of fit-for-basin technology that is unique, and that we create for the long run an opportunity to set benchmark on those contracts hence to keep our market position and enhance our future execution. And finally, we have in the last few quarters, last few months actually, to roll out our digital operation capability to extract further automation, further efficiency on this. So we have improved, enhance customer collaboration on those contracts, we have created the technology portfolio that is starting to mitigate and enhance the operation execution. And we have rolled out unique digital features that are creating. So those conditions are unique, customer recognize it, and I think as we’ll get the opportunity to renew this contract and expand would obviously look for making sure the commercial terms and the revenue quality will exploit in the future will be more accretive than they are today.
Sean Meakim: Thanks, Olivier. That's very helpful. It's encouraging as well. So just to come back maybe to cash flow north of $2 billion of free cash looks to be the bar here for full-year just given the 10% margin target. Could you just maybe highlight any major levers that would materially deviate from that goal? And then I'm also just thinking beyond cash flow? Are there plans for potential further pruning of the portfolio to optimize fit-for-basin maybe help accelerate de-levering of the balance sheet?
Stephane Biguet: So look, Sean I don't think there's anything that's going to deviate from us achieving double-digit, i.e. possibly more than 10% free cash flow this year. There is a typical seasonality in the working cap and free cash flow throughout the year. So free cash flow will improve quarter-after-quarter like it has in the past and we'll deliver on that ambition. It can be enhanced by exceptional proceeds. We're continuously looking at our portfolio as I mentioned earlier, we're particularly working on two key divestitures. One is I mentioned in the previous quarter that in regards to our APS portfolio, we're looking at launching very soon in the next few days actually a formal process for the APS assets in Canada, there's a lot of interest still and the economics have improved quite a bit. So we're quite hopeful there to close a good transaction. And the second one is the rigs we have in the Middle East, we're actually even more advanced there, we're in the formal process, we have short listed a few interested buyers and they're just concluding the due diligence. So we should be closing or at least signing sorry this transaction in the next few months. So this will enhance the cash flow profile and the potential reduction of our net debt and the flexibility it will give on liquidity, basically.
Sean Meakim: Very helpful. Thanks to you both.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: Thanks, good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Connor.
Connor Lynagh: I think we had noticed that you guys were a bit more upbeat on the offshore side of things. And basically, I'm wondering if you could frame how you think that markets going to trend relative to last cycle? And in particular, how do you think customers are thinking about exploration activity?
Olivier Le Peuch: That's a great question. I think first, it's worth saying that the offshore basins and the most advantage offshore basins are still very much, very critical resource and core resource for some of our customers, I'll seize some unique NOCs and the few independent that are pure play offshore independent from relative medium to large size. So first these resource are precious, this resource typically have a good geology. And as I said, both from the production plateau, they provide and the low carbon opportunity they have in term of mix or API grade, I think these are excellent resources. The second thing I believe is that the economics for offshore due to integration success, FEED technology and digital practice have improved from the last cycle. And I think opportunity exists for industry to leverage this and accelerate some FID going forward. So, another factor that is very critical as you touch the exploration appraisal is that most of the major and large NOC on this -- in this context are recognizing the impact of exploiting hubs, offshore hubs and the offshore hubs, the opportunities is to exploit those hubs to improve the return on asset, improve return on infrastructure and focus on near field or backyard exploration, so that they maximize the return on existing infrastructure, existing FPSO existing platform. So, that it is also something that plays very well in our portfolio for configuring or for subsidy back as we are expanding this domain. So, I believe that the expression appraisal will not necessarily accelerating frontier exploration, but will accelerate the near field exploration offshore, and we’re starting to see this this quarter and will accelerate during the second-half of the year. So I'm optimistic indeed on offshore and if you read some of the Rystad or IHS reports or some of the reports, highlighting the FID pipeline, and you see that FID pipeline that are already pre committed towards '22 '23 have the potential over '22, '23 and beyond to eclipse the last 2017, 2019 in terms of number of projects, but also in terms of total CapEx invested in deepwater.
Connor Lynagh: Got it. It's helpful. And maybe just sticking with the offshore theme, could you help us think through on the Production Systems, I think you called out you expected all Divisions to grow sequentially, but how should we think through the long cycle portion of that business particularly the subsea business?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think first the Production System I think is not only subsea system as both short and long cycle as exposure in short cycle in North America to the ESP which is coming back strongly and the Cameron surface equipment also servicing the frac and our partner Liberty and also internationally is indeed a mix of short for ESP and some completion equipment and long cycle for midstream as well as for subsea and surface equipment. So, it's a mix of long and short with very, very tangible exposure in North America benefiting short-term and long-term international long cycle both recovery and production new products. In that context and back to the point on offshore, I believe that the subsea market is very alive, and I think last year the number of subsidiaries were so short of 200 compared to higher than 50 in 2019. The prediction this year is to be above 200, 220 these are our prediction and that's align with the market prediction and this will be more or less increasing going forward gradually to be within between 250 to 300 over the mid-term period to support these offshore project.
Connor Lynagh: Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Connor.
Operator: And our next question is from Marc Bianchi with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you. The guidance for second quarter for the mid-single-digit revenue and 50 to 100 of margin improvement seems to suggest a little bit maybe weaker margin progression than I would have otherwise expected and certainly if I look at the operating leverage of the business that's had over the past few quarters. It would seem that there's a little bit less operating leverage implied in second quarter. So, I'm curious, are there some unusual costs that you're realizing perhaps there’s startup costs for some of these contracts you mentioned? Any color around that and how maybe that could progress beyond second quarter would be helpful.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, Marc, thank you for the question. So indeed, our guidance, though, for operating margin expansion between 50 and 100 bps into the mid single-digit would still imply on the high end of that on that range 30-plus incremental [margin] (added by the company after the call). So, I believe that this is the first remark. The second is that we are still on track. Okay and very confident on our 250 to 300 bps full-year margin expansion. So, in the second quarter, indeed, there are two factors. One is the fact that you're mobilizing for what the offshore return and some of the activity that are prepping and mobilizing for the second half already in the later part of the quarter. But also there are some persistent but temporary COVID-related constraints and costs that as the lockdown are still in place in many countries that adding costs upfront, in to those mobilization and making this mobilization cost maybe a little bit more than they would have been in other cycles in the past. So these are the factors that are shaping up. But we're very confident that the margin expansion is in place and we continue going forward.
Marc Bianchi: Wonderful, thank you for that. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks and then in also in the press release about the kind of double-digit growth for the second-half in international setting up for kind of upside to already robust growth anticipated for '22. I'm curious what the baseline is for that comment. Are you referring to a market forecast that's out there? Are you referring to sell side consensus, just curious what the benchmark we should be thinking about this?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, it's a combination of facts. As I said, I think there are some market indicators from the CapEx of some of the NOC national company, there is rig counts projection that we're making based on engagement with customer and with rig contractor. And there are some markets position or market enhancements and contract award, we have been benefiting in the last few quarters. So the mix of our market position, favorable mix, the market expansion on international for that has an element of seasonal effect as well as re-investments. And the national oil company, increasing the investment in second half, all combined to make us more confident in where three months ago on the shape and inflection of this recovery in the second-half.
Marc Bianchi: Got it. Thanks, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much. Last question…
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, I'll turn you back to Schlumberger for closing remarks.
Olivier Le Peuch: Okay, thank you very much. So, thank you. And to conclude, I'd like to offer three takeaways: First, the macro economic and activity outlook are increasingly supporting an attractive industry upcycle, characterized with an inflection in international activity, a consolidation of short-cycle activity, and the return advantage offshore plays, all playing to our core strength. In particular, we're increasingly optimistic about the international growth trajectory during the second-half of the year, which absent of a setback in pandemic recovery, will result in full-year international growth. As a consequence, we have reinforced our confidence in our 2021 financial targets on margin expansion, and free cash flow generation. Second, we're convinced that our performance strategy is aligned with a new industry landscape, and is increasingly resonating with our customer as performance matters critically in this environment. This is translating into market wins, particularly in the Middle East and offshore basins, and will support our ambition to outperform through this cycle. In addition, the steady progress in our digital strategy will translate over time in expanding new revenue streams and accretive margins. Third, the margin expansion realized this quarter both sequentially, and year-on-year is reflecting the impact of both our capital stewardship strategy and the restructuring program and will translate into substantial operating leverage as the year progress and activities strengthens in all basins. We anticipate the upcoming quarters to further this margin expansion with broad contribution from our Basins, and Divisions. Finally, our commitment towards both sustainability and New Energy is materializing in a growing portfolio of technology and ventures that will contribute to the global climate actions and to the future of the company. Ladies and gentlemen, this year represents a unique opportunity for the new Schlumberger to execute on its new performance journey and outperform the market within an increasingly attractive outlook. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead. 
ND Maduemezia: Thanks, Lea. Good morning. And welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Earnings Call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially, from those projected, in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics, starting with our fourth quarter performance and my perspectives on what we accomplished in 2020. Thereafter, I will share our view of the 2021 outlook and the ambition we have set at the start of a new growth cycle. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results and we will open the floor to questions. First, let me start by thanking the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience and outstanding performance in an exceptional year. The Schlumberger team significantly improved both, safety and service quality, two strong foundations of our performance strategy, despite COVID-19 adversity. In fact, this performance proved to be a critical differentiator for our customers, allowing us to strengthen our market position. This contributed to ending the year on a very strong note, and I am extremely proud of the results in the fourth quarter and our momentum headed into the New Year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid sequential revenue growth in both North America and the international markets and in all the four Divisions. We also recorded another quarter of sequential margin expansion, and cash flow from operation before severance was more than $1 billion. The recovery in the international markets and offshore, particularly deepwater, has commenced and was broad, with more than half of our international business units posting sequential growth, including most in MEA region. Our offshore long-cycle exposure and favorable positions in the short-cycle markets combined to deliver this peer-leading sequential international growth, ahead of rig activity. In North America, we posted strong double-digit revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, both onshore and offshore. Notably on land, our well construction and surface systems growth exceeded pressure pumping and outpaced rig count. This underscores the strength of our market position and breadth of services supporting shale activity and complementing our partnership with Liberty going forward. All-in-all, this was a very strong fourth quarter where we demonstrated the scale of our market exposure, the strength of our international franchise, the reset of our earnings power, and a very solid free cash flow conversion. Now, let me give you my perspective on what we had achieved last year. First, in line with our returns-focused strategy and as a response to the unique crisis, we restructured the Company globally, and in North America, we scaled to fit and high graded our portfolio. Internationally, we organized around key basins, addressed underperforming business units and contracts, and divested our Argentina APS asset. These actions have reset our operating leverage, and we exited 2020 with EBITDA margins restored to 2019 levels. Through 2021, we will build on this earnings power and visibly expand our margins. Second, we capitalized on growth drivers for the future, positioning our new Divisions ahead of the recovery cycle, aligned with our customers’ workflows and key drivers in the new industry landscape, the digital transformation imperative, the mandate for sustainable and lower carbon operations, and the priorities for step change in Production & Recovery, maximizing reservoir performance, and well construction integration and efficiency. On digital, I am particularly proud of our achievements in 2020, both internally and externally. Through our industry digital platform strategy, we are enabling digital transformation at scale, unlocking significant value and leading innovation across the digital domain in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the highlights in our release this morning, which include enterprise-wide deployments, AI partnership, and expanding use cases of our digital platform. As a result, digital was the most resilient of our businesses during 2020, only second to subsea long-cycle, and is set to initiate an accretive growth cycle from 2021. Third, we launched Schlumberger New Energy to establish market positions and develop differentiated groundbreaking technology in multiple low or zero-carbon energy ventures. Our New Energy portfolio is very diverse and includes ventures in hydrogen, CCUS, lithium, geothermal, and geo-energy. As you have seen in this morning’s earnings release, we announced significant progress with Celsius Energy and Genvia. In fact, we have made progress in every New Energy venture in 2020, enabling us to scale or to prepare entering commercial agreements for these ventures during 2021, an essential step in our clear ambition to position Schlumberger at the forefront of new and sustainable energy technology in the coming years. New Energy is a platform for long-term growth, and we will be making more announcements on these ventures over the coming weeks and months. Finally, last year, we accelerated our engagement with customers to provide solutions for the decarbonization of oil and gas operations and reinforced our commitment to improving our ESG performance. Specifically, we progressed on the adoption of both TCFD and SASB frameworks to increase the transparency of our environmental disclosures, resulting into the high-grading of our rating in the CDP Climate Change Program assessment to a peer-leading A minus. We also delivered a 15% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity within one year, well on our path to our stated 2025 emissions reduction goal. Now, I’d like to share some of our views on the 2021 outlook. Absent of a new setback in the pandemic control and economic recovery, we see constructive macro drivers developing through the course of the year. In the near-term, disciplined OPEC+ supply actions are supporting oil prices well above crisis levels, while demand is projected to build up throughout the year. The exact magnitude and scale of demand inflection will be driven by the pace of global vaccine rollouts, easing of lockdowns, and coordinated economic stimulus through 2021. In North America, we anticipate continued momentum and a strong start to 2021 in land markets as activity continues to build up towards maintenance levels, both in well construction and completions. However, U.S. production will still be visibly below previous production levels, as continued capital discipline and the impacts of consolidations will cap the spending level, and rate of growth may slow in the second half due to budget exhaustion. As a consequence, we anticipate growth in NAM to be in the mid-teens when contrasted with the run-rate of the second half of 2020, excluding OneStim. In this scenario and as the market starts to rebalance, the call on international supply will increase, and we do expect to see an acceleration of the international recovery, both short and long-cycle, after the seasonal dip in the first quarter. Thus, in 2021 we anticipate the international activity to build up from the second quarter and in the second half of the year to exceed second half of 2020 by double digits. This macro backdrop is very favorable to Schlumberger both in North America and internationally. We expect all Divisions, including Reservoir Performance on a pro forma basis excluding OneStim to post full-year incremental growth compared to the second half of 2020 with the growth trajectory across the different Divisions shaped by the NAM-international mix and the relative exposure to short and long-cycle markets. Building on this combined NAM and international activity recovery, our new operating leverage will support a very significant EBITDA margin expansion in 2021 with an ambition to achieve 250 to 300 bps improvement versus full-year 2020, and consequently visibly above 2019 margins. In North America, this ambition will be supported by restoring double-digit margins in 2021 as a result of our strategic actions combined with the strength of our offering outside of pressure pumping and strong contribution from the offshore business unit. Internationally, with more than 80% of revenue coming from markets that will experience activity momentum, we see the combination of a favorable long and short-cycle mix, the breadth of our market exposure, and our unique fit-for-basin technology as key drivers for margin expansion throughout 2021. I will now pass on to Stephane to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Stephane?
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year. Overall, our fourth-quarter revenue of $5.5 billion increased 5% sequentially. This revenue growth was equally driven by our North America and international businesses. The sequential international growth of 3% is especially notable, considering the seasonality effects we experienced in Russia in the fourth quarter. We indeed saw tangible signs of recovery in several key offshore markets. Companywide adjusted EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter increased 73 basis points sequentially to 20.1%, which is back to our full-year 2019 level. We have reached this milestone earlier than what we had previously committed to. This performance translated into sequential incremental EBITDA margin of 34%, which illustrates our improved operating leverage following the restructuring of the Company. During the fourth quarter, we completed two key previously announced transactions, the divestiture of our North America low-flow business and the contribution of our OneStim North America pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services. We look forward to working alongside Liberty to maximize the value of our partnership as the activity in North America land rebounds. As of year-end, we have completed more than 90% of our ongoing restructuring program that will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed cash costs on an annual basis. The early signs of recovery in the international offshore markets, combined with the high-grading of our North America portfolio and the near completion of our restructuring efforts, will all support strong margin expansion in the future as the industry recovery unfolds. In particular, we can count on the strength of our international business, which despite a very challenging macro backdrop in 2020, generated EBITDA margins of close to 24% on a full-year basis. These margins are set to improve going forward. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $833 million increased 13% sequentially while margins increased 507 basis points to 32.4%. These increases were driven by strong APS results in Ecuador, as well as higher digital solutions and multi-client sales internationally. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was driven by higher OneStim activity in North America. OneStim revenue during the fourth quarter of $274 million increased 25% sequentially. This increase was partially offset by seasonality in Russia and lower activity in the Middle East & Asia. Despite the improved North America revenue, margins decreased 84 basis points to 8%, largely driven by Russia. While OneStim’s margins did improve in the fourth quarter, they were still highly dilutive to both our North America and our Reservoir Performance margins. In fact, our fourth quarter Reservoir Performance margins would have been approximately 400 basis points higher, excluding OneStim. Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 2% and margins increased 42 basis points to 10% due to increased activity in North America, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East & Asia, partially offset by seasonality in Russia. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion increased 8% sequentially as international and North America revenues increased 7% and 11%, respectively. Margins increased 82 basis points to 9% due to higher revenue contribution from subsea and improved profitability in surface production systems. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $878 million of cash flow from operations and $554 million of free cash flow, despite making $144 million of severance payments. Excluding the significant severance payments we made, our full-year 2020 free cash flow margin is very close to double-digits. This gives us the confidence that we will achieve our ambition of double-digit free cash flow margin in 2021, and in turn, begin deleveraging the balance sheet, which is a top priority for us. For the sake of clarity, this double-digit ambition includes the effects of changes in working capital as well as any severance. Our net debt improved sequentially by $46 million, despite an unfavorable currency impact of $223 million. Net debt at the end of the year was $13.9 billion, a year-on-year increase of $753 million. Approximately $600 million of this increase is due to changes in exchange rates that impacted our foreign currency denominated debt. These currency movements are fully hedged and therefore will not result into any incremental net cash outflow. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $324 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects, and multi-client. For the full-year 2020, we spent $1.5 billion on capital investments. In line with our capital stewardship program, for 2021, we are expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. The CapEx portion of these investments is expected to be towards the lower end of our previous guidance of 5% to 7% of revenue. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. I think, we are ready for taking the questions from all of you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey. Good morning, guys. So, Olivier, international seems to me like it’s accelerated maybe a bit faster than we had talked about previously. And it sounds like you’re growing more optimistic on the outlook for the second half and certainly for ‘22 and ‘23, based on probably what you’re seeing with tenders. And you guys have just a truly differentiated position in the international market. So, maybe could you touch on both, your differentiated position, but also kind of what you’re seeing in terms of potential growth profiles over the next several years in international?
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. So indeed, I think as you have seen, we reminded everyone that we will see -- we will have seen the trough for international markets in the third quarter, and we expect this to start to rebound in the fourth which is what we have delivered. This was against a rig count that actually went down, and I think we here used the breadth of our offering, both short and long-cycle, the exposure we have which is very broad, very diverse to offset some of the rig contraction in some part of the international markets and realize some gain, occasionally [ph] our market position to offset and realize what we have delivered. So, we believe that first and foremost, the breadth of our offering, short and long-cycle, our performance, which is acknowledged by customers and giving us opportunity to encroach or gain share when activity comes back are the fundamentals of our market position internationally. Finally, we believe that our technology offering, fit-for-basin technology, digital are unique attributes that customers recognize and are ready to allocate share to have access to this technology and to leverage and to gain efficiency going forward. So, when you look now going forward on the long-term outlook, we have indeed -- we see that the market will accelerate beyond the inflection point that we see in the first quarter. That is a seasonal dip. And then we expect and anticipate that we could reach or exceed double digits on H2 to H2 on an exit-to-exit growth rate. And then, we anticipate that this will continue and even be strengthening in ‘22 and ‘23.
James West: Right. Okay, very good. And then, Olivier, a big uptick in -- a big surge in digital margins sequentially, is that something that -- is that kind of market profile expected to continue or is that kind of a blow off the top fourth quarter sales and things like that, and it might moderate going forward? I mean it’s already a really high-margin business and a great business for you guys, but how should we think about that margin profile going forward?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. First, I think, let me comment briefly on the fourth quarter results. Indeed, the fourth quarter result of the Digital & Integration division was a combination of very strong APS execution, multi-client sales that came from the seasonal effect of multi-client sales during the fourth quarter and international sales and success in our digital business. Going forward, we see beyond this exceptional performance. We still are confident that we’ll be able to maintain on a full year basis the 30% or so margins for the division of integration and digital going forward.
Operator: And next, we have a question from David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Olivier. So, sort of a slight difference from the way James kind of asked the question on the international side. So, if we think that 2023, we’re going to see global oil demand largely recover, just kind curious how you see the cadence of the different international markets? Each market is a little bit different. I’m just wondering how you see -- which ones do you think come up first, which ones come back a little bit later? Could you just sort of maybe just provide a little color around the different regions as you see it from here?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, it’s difficult to decipher this or to bring granularity out to 2023 on how the market will recover per region. But globally speaking, I think, there will be an element of short and long cycle. So, we believe first that the region that were the most impacted and Latin America is one, will have recovery growth that will come maybe first because it’s a combination of short and long cycle. We believe that the short cycle that exists in Middle East would favor that region both in short and midterm. We believe that Russia and Asia as well will benefit. And we believe that later in the cycle, from the second half of this year and later, the offshore market at large will start to benefit from long growth, but I think it’s very difficult to give a granular view of this. I think the short-cycle will benefit from sometime later this year, and the long cycle will be accelerating, we believe, in ‘22 and ‘23.
David Anderson: Okay, understood. And on the digital side, you talked about digital being a core part of your growth strategy in the next couple of years. You talked about digital solutions and software increased internationally. I’m just curious as to what type of demand pull you’re getting from customers? Is this further penetration of DELFI in terms of getting the platform to customers or is this new applications? You had mentioned a number of countries in which I do normally think about in terms of digital adoption, Russia, Scandinavia, and the like. Can you just kind of talk about what that customer pull is these days on digital, and maybe how you think that could evolve over the next couple of years?
Olivier Le Peuch: Very good question, Dave. I think, the pull is multi-faceted, I would say. There is pull from customers that are willing to step change the efficiency of their own workflows and hence gain productivity into their planning, field development, and evaluation of reservoir potential. And this is creating a pull for our workflow solutions with customers, which -- where we’re building on our desktop solution and then creating a transition to the cloud to gain scalability, productivity, and collaboration. So, that’s the first pull. The second pull is around unlocking the data. Customers are looking at ways to extract more value from the data that they own. And hence, they are looking for exploiting AI/ML tools that the industry can provide them. For this, there is this OSDU platform that the industry has adopted for which we contributed ourselves, the design of this ecosystem, and we are getting customers to pull us, and you have seen one example into our release this morning with AIQ in Middle East where the goal is to create AI solution for -- and with ADNOC and with Group 42 to deploy in the cloud in the region for ADNOC to benefit for this data insight. And finally, we see customers pulling into digital operation and trying to create step change into the way they execute their drilling, well construction or the existing extracting efficiency from their existing assets. So, these are the three pulls we see, and we have offerings that correspond to each. And you have seen that the OMV announcement this morning is mostly on the first and the second, on the workflows and the data, and you have seen some announcement we did last quarter and this quarter onto the digital operation. So, we see customers in all regions having an interest into expanding from the desktop to the cloud for their workflow, unlocking the value of that data through the cloud and through new digital solutions, including OSDU, and reaching out to operation and unlocking through edge application, the automation and application of AI to operation. So, we see this across multiple regions and all the customer type.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: So, nice to see the strong incremental margins in Q4 with really digital being an impressive contributor. Also appreciate the guidance around margins for ‘21. I thought you said 250 to 300 basis-point margin expansion in ‘21 versus ‘20 I believe is the comment. And maybe you could just discuss that or pull that apart a little bit on the biggest drivers of this expansion, is it digital predominantly or other divisions, and maybe thoughts across the divisions as far as margins? And then, around North American margins, timing of when you think potentially you could reach that double-digit level?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Good question, Angie. Let me bring clarification back on what we said this morning in the prepared remarks. So, ambition for 2021 is to expand margin by 250 to 300 bps or higher, if the market conditions allow us, between 2021 and full-year 2020. And this will exceed vis-à-vis the 2019 margins on a full year basis. So, we see this will be driven by three factors. First, the full benefit of our restructuring efforts where we have realized at the end of 2020 more than 90% of our 1.5 permanent structural cost reduction; secondly, the impact of our portfolio high-grading in North America that will actually allow us in the current market condition to reach or exceed double digit in North America in 2021; and finally, from the incremental margins from our international franchise, where we expect the combination of efficiency measure, including digital, digital operation for our own operation, the combination of the firewall market mix, if I may, and the strength for fit-for-basin technology to differentiate and give us the edge and hence, the growth of our margin internationally. So, when you combine all of this, this will give us this margin -- visible margin expansion year-on-year of 250 to 300 bps or above visibly the 2019, despite being significantly down on top-line. So, Division per Division, we anticipate actually, from the run rate of -- for the full year, we expect all Division to actually expand margins on a full year basis. And I think this is not only digital. I think, Reservoir Performance by the exit of OneStim we’ll, as Stephane did comment in his prepared remarks, get the benefit from that as a margin mix and will further expand, Well Construction due to efficiency and market growth we’ll also get benefits on incremental. And production and digital, as I commented before, will establish itself at a high 20% or 30% margin for the full year. So, I hope it does clarify for you the margin mix and rationale and the drivers for this expansion.
Angie Sedita: No, that’s very helpful. I really appreciate the detail, Olivier. So, maybe we could talk a little bit about New Energy. Obviously, you have a lot of initiatives that are currently announced and apparently more to come. But, maybe you could specifically talk about the Genvia and hydrogen and the opportunity around electrolyzer and then geothermal energy and maybe the timeline and where the biggest opportunity set is amongst the two.
Olivier Le Peuch: Okay. So, I’m not sure that I will have -- I will take the time to comment on each and every one of these. So, let me comment briefly on the Genvia. So, indeed, Genvia is a venture we have created with partners, including research arms of the -- in France to indeed industrialize, commercialize solid-oxide electrolyzer technology that is set to be changing a bit the usual efficiency of this electrolyzer use for green hydrogen production. The market towards 2030, to give you a sense, is expected to be about 70 gigawatts of installed capacity of electrolyzer that needs to be installed in the world globally. We’ve obviously ambition to be participating into that market and create and capture share of that market through our solution. Our solution will be to deliver this electrolyzer capacity to the market, sometimes used in -- for reversibility in fuel cells, and most of the time used to produce hydrogen. So, ambition indeed is to develop this across the next few years. Our milestones, speaking about this, will be to technically demonstrate this in the coming quarters and deliver some prototypes to our partners that will use it in fuel cell or in hydrogen production. And from that point on, in the next two or three years, make a decision, a critical decision to build and expand into large-scale manufacturing to respond and take share into this market. So, each of these ventures that we are entering into is using the same multi-steps approach where we invest in technology, we test the market with partners, and we then derisk, commercialize and ready ourselves for scale. So, that’s the approach we are having, not entering into large capital-intensive project, but leveraging our domain, subsurface domain expertise that is very applicable for CCS, very applicable for geothermal, leveraging our technology, industrialization capability that is very applicable for all of this venture, and finally, leveraging our global footprint so that we can work with partners everywhere in the world and respond to the energy transition on a global basis.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: So, I wanted to come back to the international recovery question and ask it a slightly different way. When I think about the U.S., the U.S. has transitioned from gross mode, to call it, maintenance plus mode. But, when I think about the rest of the world, most markets abroad were closer to that maintenance mode pre-pandemic with a few exceptions in there. But Olivier, how do you think about what this means for recovery potential on a multiyear basis? Over the next few years, how close could the activity set abroad get to the pre-pandemic level just given kind of the starting point where we were kind of from more of a maintenance mode in many of these countries pre-pandemic?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Thank you, Scott. I think, if we assume and take the hypothesis that the market indeed will converge towards maintenance mode in the U.S., we have to remember that through this crisis, the U.S. production has gone down by 2 million barrel. And if we assume that the next two or three years will not give us the activity, intensity and investment to recover this 2 million barrel, what will happen is that this 2 million barrel will have to be supplied internationally. Hence, the market share of supply will change in favor of international market. When you equate this and assume that the oil demand will go back to the 2019 level by 2023, and some are predicting earlier by 2022, I think, this will create the condition to -- for the budget spend internationally to actually match the 2019 by the 2023, 2025 latest horizon. Hence, it matches our hypothesis that we can return EBITDA of 2019 in the period of 2023 to 2025 as we’ll benefit from this market rebound international from now to 2023. So, that’s our hypothesis going forward is that the market supply share will rebalance slightly, will favor international and will, as a consequence, pull international activity to 100% or more in the next two or three years.
Scott Gruber: That makes a lot of sense. And maybe just a little bit of color on working capital in ‘21, should be somewhat of a headwind, not necessarily a bad thing as it reflects demand recovery. But just how should we think about it, either in terms of an aggregate number or on an intensity basis, if you want to give us some color on days outstanding for the key items?
Stephane Biguet: Scott, I’ll take this, -- Stephane. If you look at 2020 actually, our cash flows only benefited from a very modest working capital release. So, conversely, if you look at growth in 2021, we don’t see a big working capital increase. There will be some as activity grows, but our working capital intensity is not that high. So, we will try to keep this to a minimum. And at the same time, we will benefit from the full-year effects of our cost-out program, which are all cost savings and the discipline on CapEx. So, we don’t see working cap as a big headwind. We will be able to offset this with the underlying cash flow performance and get, for sure, to this double-digit free cash flow margin within the -- in 2021.
Operator: And our next question is from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: So, back to D&I margins, if you don’t mind. A lot of moving parts here in 2020 given what happened in Ecuador. You touched on some of the drivers of the sequential improvement in 4Q. It was also up 900 basis points year-on-year. So, could you maybe just unpack which of the drivers were the biggest components of that delta? Was it digital? Was it APS efficiencies and streamlining? I was just asking for help in squaring the difference between historicals and now the expected plus 30% trajectory going forward.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, it’s a mix of both. I think, you pointed out to the components. I think, we expect going forward that the contribution of EPS operating at -- with very strong performance. We have improved our performance significantly in that -- in this. We are increasing back the digital as a component of this going forward. We expect contribution of this maintaining EPS performance to the level that we have seen in the last two quarters. We divested some investment in APS as well. That has helped us improve the margin of APS. And the future growth, anticipated growth and margin accretion from digital will combine to maintain this at the level that I mentioned here, the high-20s or 30s.
Sean Meakim: And if we just think about the drivers of the 250 to 300 basis points of improvement in margin year-on-year in ‘21, how much will be attributed to pulling out OneStim, and then divestments and just year-on-year improvement of, let’s say, a full year of production in Ecuador, so that’s the impact of APS. If we take those two components out, how much enhancement is there for the rest of the portfolio? I know that may not be a calculation you have necessarily offhand. But trying to think about, aside from those two big items, trying to see how much of the rest of the portfolio is improving on a margin basis, thanks to the rest of the cost efforts.
Stephane Biguet: So, Sean, actually, the few items you mentioned, they do of course help the margin. But, when you look at the global margin, taken together, those three items are not that material. So, the margin tailwind is mostly from the cost-out program actually, optimizing and resetting our earnings power. And from the incrementals on the international activity and the mix you’ve seen on our international margins, even on a full-year ‘20 basis, which was not the best, the best are pretty high. So, most of the margin expansion come from there and cost-out program with a little bit of help from the factors you mentioned, on a global basis.
Operator: Next we go to Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Thank you for all the color so far. So, Olivier, the question I have for follow-up is again on the international front, since it’s a major point of emphasis. It seems like your commentary with respect to the offshore recovery is notable in the context that other peers didn’t really explicitly referenced that. So, two things. I’m kind of curious as to what you are seeing from the customer base that’s giving you that level of conviction to specifically highlight that? And then, second, given the fact that your peers haven’t really explicitly stated it, it would lead, at least me to believe that you have some unique opportunities that your peers may not.
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Thank you. I think, let me first comment on the actual results. And I think the actual results indeed, if you look at the very specific country, the very specific basin where we have growth to sort of the GeoUnits, as we call them, that had growth in the fourth quarter sequentially, where offshore GeoUnits from Guyana to Brazil, from the other around the world where we had -- and West Africa, did grow. So, that is a fact. And indeed, we can attribute this to market position and our market share that we have and benefit from in those markets clearly. And I think we had even a couple of them, including Guyana that were year-on-year growing from Q4 2019. So, we had some indeed traction into these. And I think that came from the market that did rebound in deepwater. Deepwater was in Q4 higher than in Q3 in term of actual rig count. It was offset by some other rig activity going down or slowing down in the fourth quarter. But, I think the offshore deepwater specifically was up. Now, going forward, we don’t see a setback to that trend. And aside from the deep seasonal effect into the first quarter, we see that this will grow going forward. If we look at our projection, deepwater is actually a gain. The rig that will benefit the most in 2021 going forward into the teens in term of year-on-year projection by contrast with shallow that will only see single-digit as well as land. So, when you combine all of this, that give us the -- our market position established and demonstrated during the fourth quarter. And our anticipated rebound for long-cycle that we see in the contract out there for the deepwater give us the confidence that offshore will contribute meaningfully to our international rebound in second half.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That’s great. That’s great color. And then, my follow-up is going to be on the New Energy front. You were very informative about the things that you have going on right now. I’m kind of curious, right, as investors look at opportunities to participate in the energy transition and companies like yourselves look to participate in that energy transition, I just wondering if you can give us some general sense as to what you think the total addressable market could be for the services and technology and the partnerships that you are currently involved in, say, over the course of the next three to five years? Any insights on that would be really helpful.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think, I will -- to give granular view per venture, I think, we will give ourselves the next few weeks and months to prepare communication to all of you on that front. And for sure, before the mid-year, I think, we will come with a much better view for all of you on where we participate. But needless to say, that each and every one of the ventures we participate has a very significant potential on total addressable market. I think, we are here having the ambition a create a Division that will supplement the four Divisions that we currently have within the decade. And we believe that the market for each of hydrogen, CCUS, geothermal, geo-energy or lithium, is very significant. So, I don’t want to go into any detail. But, I think I just mentioned and give you the example of the 70-gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity that will have to be installed within the next 10 years. That gives you a sense of what is happening. There will be 800 million tons of CCS that will have to be captured between now and the end of the decade in projects that will work with emitters to create conditions to capture and sequestrate this carbon, and lithium oxide as well for the high-density battery will grow significantly in the decade to come. So, each and every of this venture has a unique and fast-growing TAM. Now, the reason why we are maybe unique in our position into this. First, we have a domain that is relevant in experience into this, particularly in CCS and in geothermal. Second, I think, we have a track record of industrialization and development of technology at scale. And third, I think, we know how to partner and deliver technology and deploy technology and solution everywhere in the world with any partners. And you will see announcement coming in the next few weeks and few months as we’ll illustrate that at scale.
Operator: And our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: I guess, if we could kind of talk about 1Q a little bit, and kind of maybe give us some color, maybe directionally, or if you want to quantify maybe what you think kind of North America revenues would be up or down if you back out OneStim? And then, maybe some color around international revenues, and then, maybe the margin progression. Obviously, you’re pulling out OneStim, but then you put in the equity income from Liberty, so just trying to help us maybe directionally on EBIT margins as well.
Stephane Biguet: So, if I understand your question correctly, Chase, you are asking for the first quarter, some colors on the first quarter. I think, we have mentioned in our prepared remarks and in our earnings release that we anticipate after a strong quarter, the usual seasonal dip, partly international market. We see that every year, and we have seen it for the last 10 years. We don’t see it different this year. I think, we don’t see it as a pronounced dip. But we see it at a usual, what we say, seasonal effect that we see affecting Russia, affecting some of the China or offshore market in the first quarter. When it comes to North America, I will again differentiate between offshore, that will transition from a quarter where we delivered some subsea and some multi-client, significant impact on the third quarter -- on the fourth quarter from -- into the first quarter. Whereas in the land market activity, as we mentioned, we foresee a continuity of activity pickup that will transition from the growth rate we have seen in the last part of last year, and that will continue. And we see this growing at the same rate, both on rig and on completion activity.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. And then on the margin side, as you pull OneStim out, do you think that margins can hold flat or be higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis?
Stephane Biguet: The margin there will see the -- on the revenue dips, you will have, of course, a bit of decremental. But it will not be as pronounced as we have normally indeed because of the OneStim effect going into Q1, particularly for NAM. So, the NAM margin of course will not decrease. And overall, we should be able to maintain overall the same level of margin.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. And then, pre-COVID, you were talking about divestitures. You were working on land rigs. And then you messaged that APS in Canada would be entertained over the medium term. So, now that macro conditions are getting a little bit better, could you kind of update us on your view on some of these divestitures?
Stephane Biguet: We are, of course, pretty much still working on these fronts and other. On the rigs, we have -- we are still looking at transactions in Australia. And then, in the Middle East, we have some progress there, but nothing to disclose at this stage. It’s a bit of a different format than what we had looked at before, but it’s still on the books. Regarding Canada, our APS project there, called Palliser, the macro environment is indeed getting quite better when looking at this asset. And we are -- we have a lot of interest building up. So, we think there is value to be extracted there. And I think, we’ll be in a position even probably to launch a formal process sometime in the next few months. So, lots of interest in Canada and hopefully, it will result into something good happening this year.
Operator: Our next question is from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchi: Maybe just circling back to the line of questioning around the first quarter. A lot of moving pieces with OneStim and such. Could you maybe comment on how you see first quarter shaping up relative to consensus? I see EBITDA of about $1 billion right now for consensus.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we -- as we said, I think we see the seasonal impact affecting international. We see the effect and positive effect of the non-effect on OneStim. And overall, I think we looked at the full year more than the first quarter. We are confident that the margin from operating margin will be steady as we transition the first quarter despite a minimum dip from seasonal effect, international, offset partially by North America.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks for that, Olivier. The other thing that struck me was CapEx. So, you mentioned the CapEx would be at the low end of the 5% to 7% range, but on an absolute basis, the midpoint is up a bit, but your overall revenue is down a bit. I understand there is APS and multi-client. Maybe you could break those out for us and expand a little bit more on how you see CapEx shaping up over the course of the year.
Stephane Biguet: Sure. So really, as a reminder, we are really looking at the capital investments altogether, right, the CapEx portion, as you mentioned, APS and multi-client. And there, in 2020, we spent $1.5 billion. It was quite a reduction from 2019, a 45% reduction, more than what the revenue reduced actually, so the intensity reduced in 2020. So, we start from a very low base. We may maintain it around the $1.5 billion, but we want to leave ourselves a little bit of room to capture the growth we are starting to see, particularly in the international market. We want to be ready to deploy CapEx in the most lucrative markets, and we don’t want to miss the opportunity. So, we will monitor and modulate accordingly, but we will stay within the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. As it relates to CapEx only, yes, I think, it will be closer to 5% with the current equipment, the capacity we have and the capital efficiencies we have realized. But we leave a bit of flexibility. We’ll monitor, but we’ll stay within the range we stated for total capital investments.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. We will continue exert capital discipline, as you know. So, we’ll make -- we want to give ourselves optionality, hence, our guidance. But we’ll keep agility and extracting efficiency from our existing fleet to make sure we minimize the capital spend going forward. And we are here We are indeed very firm on to our being on the low end of our 5% to 7% for the CapEx aspect of our capital.
Operator: And our next question is from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: Yes. Thanks. I kind of wanted to return to the digital integration business a little bit. So, hey, very much appreciated that you disclosed the value of the OMV contract, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out how to think about the market for this business. I guess, what I’m wondering if you could frame is, given that size of the contract, is this a small contract relative to the opportunities that you’re looking at? Is it mid-sized contract? Is it a large contract? How should we think about if you continue to expand your customer base, how that can roll through? And then, are there additional [Technical Difficulty]
Olivier Le Peuch: Go ahead. Go ahead, sorry. We got an interruption here. Go ahead, please, Connor.
Connor Lynagh: Yes. I’m sorry. Can you hear me now?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, we could hear you until this point. Go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: Okay. Thank you. So basically, the question is, can you frame the size of the OMV contract? I’m curious, relative to the size that you’ve disclosed there, how significant is this contract relative to the opportunities that you’re looking at? And can you help us understand the life cycle of a typical contract with a customer in Digital & Integration? Is this a relationship that evolves and grows over time? And can you quantify maybe how significant that opportunity could be?
Olivier Le Peuch: Great question, Connor. I think, obviously, we are very proud of this large enterprise deployment contract that we have earned with OMV, and we will work with them over the next few quarters to roll out our solution and create unique AI workloads that will accelerate and step change their positive efficiency for their own operation. But, this -- I think, to realize that this is a large contract is just also to compare the scale of some of our customers we’re working for. The contract size can be much more significant than the one we have just announced. So, I think, the rates and the range of contract we’ll -- we are engaged with our customers is very broad from customers that are willing to get access on demand to some simulation compute, or the customers are willing to do a full transition of all of their workflows, data and enterprise solution to the cloud, similar to what OMV is engaging with us is a broad portfolio of what we are engaging with customers. So, to give you an example, I don’t think there is more than -- there is many more than one example, and it will go from single million dollar investment to a large multi-hundred million dollar over long-term contract. So, the typical engagement includes a transition engagement that will transition the data, transition the workflows, and then includes a transition to the SaaS model, Software-as-a-Service, or Data-as-a-Service for the long run. So, these typical contracts are 5 or 10 years and include a transition and then an exploitation part of the contract.
Connor Lynagh: That’s very helpful. And I guess, maybe you could help us understand, I think, typically, these types of contracts have maybe relatively breakeven or at least lower margin profiles at the beginning and then expand over time. Should we think about that for you guys? I mean, if we’re in sort of early days for some of these digital initiatives, is there a margin tailwind that we should expect?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I will not comment that way. I think, it depends on every contract on the commercial condition we negotiate with the customer. There is always obviously a technology investment that we have been doing for the last five years. And we continue to invest in technology. And every project and every commercial engagement is different. So, it’s very difficult to make any projection or any trends. I believe that we gave a little bit of indication of the highly accretive margins, and we believe that this is true and holding true for the entire portfolio we have and would not want to comment project or contract by contract.
Connor Lynagh: Okay, okay, understood. Maybe just to sneak one more in here. Just to continue to enhance your digital initiatives, do you feel that you need to step up your capital expenditure or your research and development at this point to achieve some of the goals that you’ve laid out, specifically the doubling of that business over time?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, we believe that we have created a very significant investment in the last five years when we created a foundation of this DELFI, Agora, OSDU foundation. We are working with partners to augment the capability of this foundation as per the announcement we made with IBM and the collaboration we have with Google and Microsoft. And we’ll continue to work with partners, continue to spend and allocate a large portion of our engineering effort into this. And we believe that we are well covered to create the growth pattern that we have announced going forward.
Connor Lynagh: Thanks very much.
Olivier Le Peuch: You’re welcome, Connor. So, I believe that it’s time to start to close. I think we are running out of time at the clock. So, thank you, everyone. And I think to conclude, I would like to offer three takeaways. First, the strength of our results during the first quarter-- the last quarter, built on a very broad performance improvement across divisions, both in North America and internationally, speaks volumes about our market positioning and the effectiveness of our strategic execution during the year. We are starting 2021 from a position of strength, having reset our earnings power and return potential. Second, with a gradual return of demand throughout 2021, we anticipate North America activity to continue consolidating towards sustaining production, and international activity rebounds to broaden and accelerate in the second half. This aligns very well with the evolution of our portfolio in North America and with our established international market positions and should lead all Divisions to post incremental growth in 2021 when contrasted to the second half of 2020, and for the company to expand full-year margins significantly above 2020 and visibly ahead of 2019. Third, our strategic execution has created a platform to capitalize on growth drivers in the new landscape, as we witnessed the beginning of a new chapter in our industry, a chapter where digital is an imperative for industry efficiency; a chapter where innovation and technology will impact field development, asset performance, and production & recovery; and a chapter where industry resilience will be defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint. We are prioritizing our investment towards these growth drivers and at the same time, will continue to accelerate our expansion into New Energy venture to prepare for the future. Ladies and gentlemen, we are reinventing ourselves and are delivering financial results ahead of our stated ambition. Our company is on a new performance journey with attractive, yet resilient return, and very exciting growth prospects in and beyond our core industry. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-16 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.
ND Maduemezia: Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Third-Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today’s call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. For today’s agenda, Olivier will start the call with his perspective on the quarter and our updated view of the industry macro after which Stephane will give more detail on our financial results. Then we will open for questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third-quarter press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for joining us on the call today. In my opening remarks, I would like to focus my commentary on three parts: first, our third-quarter operational and financial performance; next, progress with the implementation of our strategy; and third, our updated view on the near-term business outlook. After this, Stephane will provide greater details on our financial results. In the third quarter, we had an opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months and set a marker of outperformance—through top-line resilience, margin expansion, and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record. In an ongoing activity trough, our third-quarter sequential performance was exceptionally strong. Yet again, we continued to maintain benchmarks of safety and service quality in our operations. Sequential margin expansion rebounded by more than 300 basis points for both IBT and EBITDA, and free cash flow was solidly positive. The strength of our margin expansion and free cash flow performance is even more impactful in the context of a slight topline decline and the exceptional items during the quarter. I would like to thank the entire Schlumberger team for this remarkable performance and for excellence in execution. These results represent a defining step in the reset of our earnings power at the trough of the cycle and set the stage for our long-term outperformance. Starting with operations, in the third quarter, we maintained benchmark integrity performance, with year-over-year improvements at 30% in HSE incident frequency and 34% in reliability. Operations integrity remains an area of strength for Schlumberger and the foundation of our performance strategy; our consistent service delivery earned several letters of commendation from our customers and is the basis of multiple new contract awards recorded in the quarter. Financially, we posted higher sequential pretax operating margins, more than 20% EBITDA growth and positive free cash flow—despite the severance payments and reduced working capital release versus the prior quarter. These results clearly set us on the path to our intermediate goal of restoring 2019 EBITDA margins before the end of 2021. Now, let me turn to our strategy. First, our restructuring program is progressing well and we are on track to realize most of our permanent structural cost savings as we exit this year. We also began the transition to our leaner customer-aligned structure comprised of Divisions and Basins, designed to support the basin-specific innovation that will solidify Schlumberger’s position as the performance partner of choice. Next, in North America, we achieved key milestones on our scale-to-fit strategy with two transactions that advance the high-grading of our portfolio, while lowering capital intensity and volatility—the Liberty transaction and the low-flow divestiture. The closing of these transactions will not only enhance our EBITDA margin at the global level but will further support lower capital intensity and an accelerated path to our financial goals for North America. Looking ahead at the benefits of this strategy execution, we are set to significantly improve the company’s future operating leverage. And as the market activity recovers from the current trough, we have the potential to restore EBITDA to the 2019 mark of $6.6 billion by recovering only half of the year-on-year revenue decline. Our performance strategy also focuses on new horizons of growth, which includes Digital and Production & Recovery. The industry is rapidly embracing digital enablement and shifting capital investment toward maximizing production and recovery from existing assets. Where these two industry shifts converge in essence, where digital intersects with production and recovery, Schlumberger has a unique opportunity to deploy the full power of our industry digital platform and domain expertise, spanning reservoir and production for the benefit of our customers. The best example of this was the application of our Agora* edge AI and IoT solutions on our APS project in Ecuador. By connecting field equipment to the cloud and running predictive AI at the edge, we boosted production 30% on Agora-connected wells while significantly reducing field crew visits to these wells and, as such, cutting HSE exposure and environmental impacts. This created revenue and margin on an APS project where we captured the value directly, and is just an example of what is possible at scale when we use the power of the industry digital platform to blend hardware and software to enable people—wherever they are located—to make performance impacts with digital. In addition, we continued to expand the reach of our digital platform, as demonstrated by the IBM Red Hat OpenShift agreement, further enabling adoption of our platform around the world, and particularly, with NOCs. In the quarter, we have also secured notable subsea and artificial lift contracts in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Middle East, which will result in the growth of our installed base and greater exposure to Production & Recovery CapEx and OpEx—a strong platform for the future. Finally, we continue to develop our New Energy portfolio with progress in our hydrogen technology venture, Genvia, and the creation of a geothermal project development company, which complements our low-heat geothermal venture, Celsius Energy. These exciting ventures represent a mix of unique opportunities for Schlumberger to create a differentiated market position through the energy transition. In parallel, we continue to develop avenues to contribute to the decarbonization of oil and gas operations, leveraging our technology, expertise, and execution platform to reduce our environmental impact while helping our customers reach their environmental goals. Let me take a few moments now to talk about the outlook. In the short- to mid-term horizon, the market uncertainties persist as the economic recovery remains fragile. The pace of demand recovery could possibly slow or pause as a result of a second wave of pandemic outbreaks or heightened pandemic control measures. Similarly to the third quarter, we also face risks of lingering COVID-19 operational disruptions internationally as we enter the winter season. In this context, we will continue to focus on what we can control and react promptly if necessary. Now, absent of a pause in demand recovery or higher COVID-19 disruption, the fourth quarter activity will likely extend the trends experienced as we close the third quarter, with the continuation of a modest activity uptake in North America and the stabilization towards a steady activity internationally—albeit with visible seasonal variations, the combination of which resulting into an about flat outlook overall for the quarter. Looking out further, the prevailing uncertainties make it much too early to call. However, directionally, and absent of a slowdown in the pace of economic recovery, we anticipate the overall activity to consolidate gradually during 2021. In line with the most recent IEA projections, we see that the conditions still exist to rebalance demand and supply with improving demand recovery supported by economic stimulus measures and continued supply discipline from the major producers, ultimately resulting into a visible activity rebound. North America land is expected to continue its subdued recovery in frac and drilling activity towards production maintenance levels. Internationally, as demand recovers, a pull on short-cycle supply will result in an activity inflection, this being anticipated by most operators currently evaluating options to restore activity. Having shared our view on the outlook, let me now hand over to Stephane who will talk more about our financial results.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Third-quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.16. This represents an increase of $0.11 sequentially and a decrease of $0.27 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $350 million of pretax restructuring charges. These charges primarily relate to facility exit costs, as we continue to rationalize our real estate footprint. As a result of these charges, our pretax operating income will increase by approximately $15 million per quarter going forward due to reduced lease and depreciation expenses. Overall, our third-quarter revenue of $5.3 billion decreased 2% sequentially. Pretax segment operating margins increased 355 basis points to 10.9%. More importantly, company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins increased 371 basis points to 19.4%. As a reminder, our full-year 2019 adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2%. In other words, we are well on our way to restoring our precrisis EBITDA margins of 2019, despite the severe revenue reduction we have experienced. This will be achieved through the combination of our restructuring actions and the high-grading of our portfolio. As a reminder, our restructuring program will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed costs on an annual basis. We have achieved more than 80% of these cash savings as of the end of the third quarter. We expect to complete most of the remaining actions as we exit the fourth quarter. As it relates to the high-grading of our portfolio, we achieved two significant milestones this quarter with the signing of an agreement to divest our North American low-flow artificial lift business in a cash transaction, followed by an agreement to contribute our OneStim® pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services in exchange for a 37% equity interest in Liberty. We received antitrust clearance for both transactions and we anticipate each of the closings to occur before the end of the year. It is worth noting that both transactions will be accretive to our earnings in 2021. Let me now go through the third quarter results for each segment. Third-quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1 billion decreased 4% sequentially, while margins decreased 90 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were primarily due to lower sales of WesternGeco multiclient seismic licenses in North America offshore. Drilling revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 12% sequentially while margins were essentially flat at 9.5%. The revenue decrease was driven by an activity decline in US land where the rig count dropped significantly combined with COVID disruptions and customer budget adjustments in several international GeoMarkets. Despite the revenue drop, margins were resilient as a result of cost reduction measures. Production revenue of $1.8 billion increased 12% sequentially and margins increased 11 percentage points to 12.6%. These increases were largely the result of a resumption of activity in our APS projects in Ecuador, following last quarter’s production interruption caused by a major landslide. OneStim also increased on higher fleet utilization, while profitability improved across each of our Completions, Artificial Lift, and Well Services product lines due to cost reduction measures. Cameron revenue of $1 billion decreased 5% while margins decreased by 162 basis points to 6.3% on lower OneSubsea® revenue in Asia and Europe, as well as lower Surface Systems equipment sales in North America. Now turning to our liquidity. I was again very pleased with our cash flow generation. During the quarter, we generated $479 million of cash flow from operations and $226 million of free cash flow, despite making $273 million of severance payments. This performance confirms that our cash flow generation capabilities remain intact. As a result, we will generate excess cash once our restructuring efforts are complete and, therefore, be in a position to deleverage the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.8 billion. Our net debt at the end of the quarter was$13.9 billion, an increase of $149 million compared to last quarter, but down almost half a billion when compared to the same time last year. During the quarter, we spent $200 million on CapEx and invested $28 million in APS projects. Our total capital spend for 2020, including APS and multiclient, is still expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. This represents 45% decrease as compared to 2019, mostly coming from lower CapEx in North America and reduced investments in APS projects. We took further steps to strengthen the balance sheet during the quarter. We issued $500 million of 1.400% Notes due 2025. The proceeds will be used to repay 2.200% Notes that mature in November. We also issued 350 million of 2.650% Notes due 2030. The proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper borrowings. Finally, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $10.8 billion. Before I conclude, and just as a reminder, due to our corporate reorganization we will report our results on the basis of the four new Divisions starting in the fourth quarter. We are working to provide historical restated financial information based upon the new Division structure and expect to publish this in November. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready to open the call for the questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. And your line is open.
James West: First, just a statement from me. I really appreciate you clearly stating the goal of returns above your cost of capital, or value creation as we see it, because most of the industry has lacked that progress in the last decade or so. So thank you for stating that as a clear goal of Schlumberger. The first question I have for you is you've taken several defining steps towards the reinvention of Schlumberger so far, using this crisis to your somewhat advantage. Could you talk maybe about the steps taken, and then what we should expect going forward?
Olivier Le Peuch: Great question, James. So thanks again. Indeed, we are set to continue to execute our strategy for improving our return above cost of capital. That's the foundation, okay. And we'll do that in several ways, cash flow, margins and discipline on capital, obviously. So you have seen that we have not wasted the crisis, as we could say, taking the opportunity to restructure our organization to reset to the new -- what we expect in normal. And I think we have done that in anticipating that the market will be structurally smaller, albeit it will be defined by new attributes. One of them is the basin attributes where we believe regionalization will become more critical, hence the creation of our Basin structure to support our clients in the basin to outperform in every basin, and that's the fit-for-basin strategy that is in light there. The second, obviously, transition is digital. I think digital is happening everywhere, in the office, in operation, in all aspects of our workflows, and we believe that this is a transformative step that we are ready to support. And last, I would say at a very high level, I believe that Production & Recovery will become more critical going forward as the mature assets will have to be -- the return on mature assets will have to be improved. And at the same time, energy transition from gas technology up to midstream as well as transition to new energy. I think this will give us the digital, the production recovery, the energy transition starting with gas, will give us the element of growth that will then leverage our new operating platform with the division basin as you have seen restructured to give us the opportunity to much expand our margins and reach and exceed our return above cost of capital. That's what we are set to achieving, James.
James West: And then on the margin expansion comment, you're sticking to the getting back to '19 EBITDA margins by the end of '21. What needs to happen to drive that? Do we need market growth? Is it the cost-outs you've already taken? What are the kind of key things we should be looking for to ensure that, that happens?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think there are three elements. I think the first and foremost and the one that have the most impact to date in our quarter results is the restructuring we have done when we adjusted our permanent structure and variable costs to the new normal and to the new level of activity as we foresee. And I think this has a significant amplifying impact on our return to margin expansion. So the second factor is a continuation of our strategic action in North America that aims at high-grading our portfolio and taking step to make sure that we retain and continue to invest in portfolio where we believe we can differentiate and create return above our threshold. And third is the leverage of our international footprint. So when you combine the core [inaudible] and structural adjustments that we have done to lift and reset our earnings power, the action we have taken to enhance significantly our margins in North America, our play in North America and international mix leverage, all of this will combine to elevate and gradually build our EBITDA margin to the 20% of EBITDA of 2019. And we don't need much growth to achieve this.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angeline Sedita. And your line is open.
Angeline Sedita: So a little bit to James' question around the 2019 EBITDA margins. And would you say, number one, that digital is further accretive to that 20% margin and the return to that 20% margin that you saw in 2019? And do you think those margins are as normalized for Schlumberger this cycle, or could it be better? And then finally on that as you said in your remarks, $6.6 billion in EBITDA on half the revenue, that's certainly above consensus estimates for '21 and '22. Can you give us further color there and a time line?
Olivier Le Peuch: Okay, a comprehensive question, Angie. Thank you. So first on digital, is it accretive? Absolutely. It's accretive today. It's accretive tomorrow. I think it will be accretive in the future, at a step that is certainly pulling our margins up. And I think what we are looking for to accelerate is our growth CAGR, so that it is accretive not in the future at a larger scale. So digital is and will be accretive on the way forward. Absolutely. The second question you asked is on the EBITDA of 2019, if I understand correctly, what you asked for, Angie, to reiterate. So yes, I think we are clear on our ability to deliver this EBITDA margin improvement to 20% above in the short term. And the mix we need, as I said and commented with James, is very clear. It's a combination of international, our restructuring and the international exposure that we have that are greatly accretive to this. Finally, you asked a question about when and how we will go beyond this. Our mid-cycle margin ambition is above that level. We are at a trough, at operating already very close to this 2019, having operated-- or reset of our margins. Our expectation is continuing to grow and expand, again, building our international franchise, building and accelerating our digital and being the full proof on this, but also continue to execute on our capital discipline, capital stewardship that will high grade our portfolio and will resolve some of the still outstanding underperforming business units. So, you combine growth internationally, the power of digital and our discipline on capital stewardship and addressing our underperforming contract, you have the recipe to expand the margin beyond this 20%. And you can make the math. I think we would expect indeed that with half the revenue coming back from 2019, we will expect to be in a position to reach or exceed this dollar EBITDA contribution. So, I think when is this happening, some time in the future, not 2021 clearly. 2022 will be the beginning of a cycle of international expansion, that's very likely. And after that, there will be some time but we believe this is in sight and that's what we are working to towards.
Angeline Sedita: So one more on Liberty. Maybe you could talk about the transaction in a little bit more detail, the magnitude of the accretion opportunity, the access to the customer and well site without having frac and the determination of when you'll exit Liberty? Are you a medium-term owner or a long-term owner of those shares?
Olivier Le Peuch: I'll let Stephane answer some, and I will answer on the customer engagement. Please, Stephane, on the transaction.
Stephane Biguet: Yes, sure, Angie. We are actually progressing quite well on our integration planning. The good news, we are identifying, through this process, additional synergies and opportunities for our technology collaboration that makes this combination even more compelling than we initially contemplated. So we are quite happy with partnering with Liberty. We believe there's quite a lot of upside potential in the combined company as the company -- as the synergies are realized and the market starts to recover. So we will benefit from the North American unconventional recovery as our equity stake will continue to appreciate and we will also leverage our technology alliance with Liberty. So, it is premature in that context to talk about monetization, considering where we stand in the cycle. But that will, of course, remain an option over the longer term. We have not set a timeline for this. We have not set a target price. But it will always remain an option. In terms of accretion, we've stated it will be accretive from day one. So, going into 2021, it will be positive for sure on our EPS, EBITDA and margins overall.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, I can only reinforce that I think our value proposition, the value proposition of Liberty on the market with our existing customer, I think, is undoubtful very strong with this platform, as you pure play-- the largest pure-play frac company. But we are putting in place the contract and service-level agreements across both companies to cross-license technology and to create pull-through so that we can extend the Liberty workflow and the value proposition of well site, and we can pull them on some of the contract we have on well construction, over contract to where we participate across and around the frac operation. So clearly, for both the -- beneficiary on both.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of David Anderson with Barclays.
David Anderson: So digital, you've talked about digital being a core part of Schlumberger's growth strategy, and you stated the goal to double the revenue in the medium term. Curious kind of where acquisitions fit in that part as part of the goal. I asked this back in the '90s, of course, Petrel and ECLIPSE were crucial to your success that followed the 2000s, and it's still a big part of your offering. But more recently, you've announced kind of partnerships and venture-backed companies you're involved in. I just like to understand a little bit more about your digital growth strategy as you build this business out.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think first and foremost, our strategy will evolve around a digital platform, establishing a digital platform for industry, both from the -- in the geoscience subsurface side, building on our desktop offering today and building up on our market strengths and establishing with what we did with OSDU, an open-platform foundation with data ecosystem shared with the industry and offering industry as the foundation for this. So we believe that this transition to the cloud will cement our desktop leadership position we have today and expand and create growth opportunity with new transition similar to the Chevron, similar to the Suncor, similar to the Woodside transition that we are doing with the DELFI core expanding into the cloud. So this alone is a growth avenue. The second one is digital operation, as I will call it. And I think it extends DELFI to the drilling or to the production space. But also, we have been extending and using the concept of digital platform to also introduce what we call Agora, a gateway and a platform that offers opportunity to plug AI or edge application on equipment. And I think you have seen two examples of which we described into the press release earlier today and I think this is an expansion. So that's the second axis of expanding beyond the core or beyond geosciences and expanding into operation. And the third, I think, is the domain of AI and of offering services for our customers to extract more from their workflow across and using an element of our platform, not necessarily the application but using the platform as a basis for creating value to their own IP, to their own integration capability and where we act as a system integrator and we act as a support for their workflow. So these are the avenue of growth. So we'll continue to make partnership as a basis for building these platform stacks. And we will, and when as appropriate, we believe that we have -- if we believe we have gaps into our offering and in operation, or in geosciences or in AI, we will make bolt-on acquisition, as we'll call it, to supplement or to complement this so that we better respond to this and expand in New Energy or expand into the gas midstream, for example, using the same platform.
David Anderson: So Olivier, I think one of the struggles for investors is taking digital from a conceptual idea into real-life practice. And you mentioned Agora several times in the release today. And I was wondering if you could talk about two things. If you can talk about Agora and the IBM Red Hat agreement, kind of two separate things here. Agora being more edge computing-driven, maybe you could just talk about kind of what is the best application? Where do you see that fitting in terms of your business? Like what's the most obvious application of where you can really make a difference? And secondarily, on the IBM Red Hat, you've targeted NOCs as being the customer. So what is that bringing to the NOC customer?
Olivier Le Peuch: So first, Agora. Simply said, Agora brings us ability to bring on every piece of equipment on the platform, on the rig, an ability to connect this piece of equipment to the cloud and to our platform and yet offering at this point, at this edge, an open platform where partners can provide and can plug their application, AI application typically, that will add value to this data feed. The perfect example is what you have seen on the PETRONAS application, where we have not been developing this video spacing analysis tool. One of our partners have just deployed their video tool on to our platform and connected to the camera and we served as a gateway back to the cloud. So we just provide a platform that our customer are licensing and installing on their equipment. And then their own partners, our partners, are creating value with AI routines or AI application at the edge that connects to the cloud. That's what people like in a secure way. Red Hat Openshift, simply said, is an ability to provide multiplicity of options for cloud deployment for our customers that offer hybrid cloud deployments on-premise and public and address the concern that some of our customers in some countries were facing that they cannot export their data to the public cloud, because it is -- data is present -- data residency issue, or they believe they need to control and have in-house premise cloud infrastructure. For these two solutions, we provide through OpenShift an ability to deploy DELFI on on-premise cloud infrastructure or on cloud that are not public cloud, hence addressing a market that we cannot address today. It's about 50% of the market today, 50% of the country that don't have or do not prefer to use public cloud for their hosting their data that we're unlocking through this. So, we are unlocking a significant part of market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open.
Kurt Hallead: So, Olivier, I just wanted to congratulate you and your team on a very fast pivot through an extremely difficult situation. I know you highlighted Digital way back when you first joined in September and then reiterated it in January, and it sounds like it's already paying dividends for you. So, kudos on that quick pivot. My question for you, Olivier, is we've seen a lot of recent commentary out of the major oil companies about their shift to budget from intensive fossil fuel dynamics to more green -- renewables and so on and so forth, with BP probably being the most radical in that process. Trying to connect the dots here, but it seems like with the clean energy business that you established back in the spring, it set Schlumberger up to be very well positioned in line with the potential future spending plans of some of your existing customers. So, I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more insights on how you view potentially the clean energy business evolving over time?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, obviously, we see it's not only a trend that we want to capture with our existing customers. I think, obviously, some of our customer segments are transitioning into a different role as energy company and want to add to that portfolio beyond oil and gas, including some technology and some renewables in which we also have interest. And I think at large, what we have realized is that we have a technology platform. We have an ability to deploy at scale technology. We have a subsurface knowledge. When you combine all of this, we believe that we have market position that we can take, develop into the New Energy business, be it on renewable, be it on the energy storage or be it on hydrogen. And I think this is where we are developing our venture today. We are developing it in geothermal, both low-heat and deep geothermal. That's very adjacent to our business because it exploits our subsurface knowledge, our drilling, well construction, and our ability to manage heat flows from subsurface to surface and provide digital platform to control it. So that's where we're heading. The hydrogen is very, very interesting for us because it's a huge opportunity, partially led by EU, with Green Deal and there are two avenues there. One avenue is the green hydrogen or electrolyzer where we believe we, with our new venture, Genvia, are in a position to create differentiated offering in the market to provide the market with higher efficiency and more versatile electrolyzer that can feed this 40-gigawatt capacity that EU is planning for 2030. And finally, I think we will continue to also look into CCS, which is again close to our core. But not CCS application for oil and gas, but CCS application to decarbonize the hard-to-abate sector, ammonia or SMR for hydrogen production through gas. And these are the sector that outside of our oil and gas customer, that's where we believe we can add value. And when you combine all of this, this is a very exciting future with New Energy, and we are taking position today for the long run.
Kurt Hallead: My follow-up question would be, Olivier, you mentioned the prospect for short-cycle projects to accelerate, especially in the international markets when heading out into 2022. And I know you don't want to get pinned down to any kind of specifics, but I'm just kind of curious how you would think about the magnitude of rebound. And again, you don't have to get too specific here, but just wondering how sharp of a rebound you would expect and maybe what geographic regions you would think would lead the way.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think what we see is that, clearly, I think the level of investment that's currently going into international is not sustainable, I think for two reason. I think that the demand/supply will rebalance and will create a pull on supply worldwide, and I think this will be pulling on international as well as the U.S. The North America has suffered from a setback that is creating a gap in the future supply. [Technical Difficulty] So I think short cycle is set to come back first, and then long cycle. The timing of this and the magnitude, I think, will depend on the -- obviously, on the demand -- oil demand pace, recovery pace. But what we can say is that customers are already engaging and are asking us to be ready for mobilization, be it in short or midterm, to make sure that we're not getting in the wrong direction to cut capacity beyond what they will need in the short to mid-term. So, I will expect the low-cost producer country on the core of OPEC plus to be the first to react and to rebound when the market will be there. So that includes Middle East, that includes Russia, obviously. Beyond that, I think we will see short cycle everywhere. China will continue to be executing on their energy strategy, so I don't expect this to be slowing down. And then we will see gradually infield drilling. We will see the shallow water coming back. And there's a lot of FID ready to be approved that will then accelerate back to the border. So, I think there will be a sequence in this, but short-cycle will come back, both onshore and offshore, and will come back certainly sometime in 2021 and clearly, in 2022.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. And your line is open.
Scott Gruber: Olivier, I want to come back to the renewables question. You highlight several interesting initiatives. Do you have an aspiration for renewables to be a certain percentage of revenues by, pick your year, 2025, 2030? And just given your scale, what does this mean for CapEx spend, R&D spend? And overall, how do you think about balancing a desire to see, what I believe would be your desire to see a measurable portion of your revenue stream becoming leveraged to renewables while also continuing to drive improved financial performance?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, absolutely. I think it's too early to quote a number. I think it's something that we are working, and we are continuing to develop our strategy. But I think I will not call it renewable. I think it's more than renewable. And it's not--intersects renewable, but I think it's the technology approach we have and it's not necessarily -- don't expect us to buy wind farms and go after capital projects. So that's not our intent. Our intent is to continue to play and build on our strengths, strength being our technology, being a technology partner for a renewable company, being technology partner for some of our current existing customers and being technology partner for addressing a new economy, such as hydrogen economy. I think this is where we want to be. Obviously, I want this to be meaningful. I want to be at scale in the next decade for sure, because I think at that time, we want to be in a position where we believe we will be diversifying our portfolio and building and leveraging the growth that is existing in these to make sure that we are having a diversified portfolio, but still a technology portfolio and a service and technology offering with solution to this market. So again, it's a long-term ambition with short-term investments that are helping us to create market position that are unique, that will gradually being reinforced. And we'll take a bigger position on the one we believe have the most potential in the coming years.
Scott Gruber: And I just want to circle back on the 20% EBITDA margin target for next year. You did about 19% in 3Q and what I imagine is likely close to 20% ex the to-be-divested businesses. It just seems that 20% is easily achievable, if not beatable, next year. But what am I missing? Is there still some concern around pricing as contracts roll into next year? Is there some concern that maybe customer spending abroad won't lift that much over the course of '21? So why shouldn't we consider the 20% EBITDA margin a relatively low bar, just given your 3Q performance?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. First, the way we define it is a full-year target we are taking. It will happen before the end of 2021. We believe the trajectory of the year with a gradual recovery will give us the opportunity to create a full year target that will be set at this level, or exceed. Do we anticipate and see more pricing? No. I think the pricing has been -- the pricing pressure has been with us for the last six years. I think, as I commented before, I think we have been giving away and the industry at large have been under pressure for this. The industry now is realizing that there's so much we can give, and we are working more collaboratively with our customers to find solutions to eliminate waste. Now obviously, large integrated contracts are still competitively priced, but we see that through performance, through technology, and through smart engagement and alignment with our customer, we're able to offset those pricing and competitive pressure and realize margin resilience. So pricing is and will remain with us in these years to come, possible headwinds but mostly on large integrated contracts. And I believe that when activity will come back, we’ll get opportunity to get back pricing in the right market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.
Sean Meakim: So, Olivier, I think the energy transition topic naturally kind of begs the question about the outlook for international E&P spending in the coming cycle. I appreciate your earlier comments on the cadence of how work will come back, say, next year. But what's also going to be different in this cycle is that your customers have additional calls on their cash flow that are being prioritized before upstream spending, right? IOCs are diverting more capital towards renewables, that's the plan. Independents have a first call on their cash to their balance sheets. I'm just curious how those factors influence your expectation around the international spending cycle and specifically offshore, as IOCs control most of the, specifically deepwater, acreage globally.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, that's a correct assumption. And I think we believe that what will happen is that the market will consolidate around basin's position that each of the major and large independent will concentrate on their basin plays and other strengths. And we-- I believe that we have to be smart about aligning with our customers in those key basins, be it around their core assets, such as Exxon in Guyana, such as some other IOCs in Brazil or in East Africa. We will make sure that we align ourselves with those so that we maximize the uptake of market position in those basins and continue to execute our fit-for-basin and engagement with customers to make sure we maximize those position. So that's the first thing we want to do. Next, I will comment that the national oil company are part of the mix, and I think the deepwater is indeed more domain where international companies dominate. And I think we have there a very strong position. But from shallow to land, there is a lot of activity that is pulled, both short and long cycle, by national company. And in Middle East, most of the offshore activity, if not all of the offshore activity, is led by national oil company and is growing fairly well and has been more resilient than the land activity. So we will hold on those positions and make sure we continue, as we have seen some contracts have been awarded in this domain continue to post this. So we understand that the market will be structurally different than what we could have anticipated five years ago. But we believe that the position around key basins of strength from our customers and aligning ourselves with this will provide us the opportunity to capture most of this international growth coming back.
Sean Meakim: And then I want to touch on Reservoir Characterization as well, and that segment has experienced a lot of volatility in its margins the last couple of quarters, much more than we've seen historically. I'm just curious how you'd characterize the gravitational center for those margins once the business has cost reductions impacted, et cetera. How do you think that business looks like on a full year basis once we get it through these near-term challenges?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think the comment I will offer on this is that this market is a market where the exploration market sits. And the exploration market is set from discretionary spend and it includes the multi-cloud sales that historically have been a little bit of a swing that depends on the season and depends also on the exploration discretionary budget that is available for our customers to invest in future exploration acreage. So that has left a little bit of variability. The variability has been bigger in recent times because the proportionate scale of exploration has reduced. Hence, when exploration campaign comes back, which happens every other season, and when the discretionary spend on exploration through multi clients this combines to create a very strong quarter. But at the base, the related testing, wire line and digital are still performing very well. Software was growing this quarter, one of the very few product line that did grow quarter-on-quarter and did grow as an example. So, expect this to be the consequence of most of the exposure we have on discretionary exploration spend and the exploration campaign viability that we see quarter-on-quarter. This is the most of the rationale for this more than any core issue we will have in any of the product lines that are there. Now commenting on the future, we will not comment anymore on Reservoir Characterization, as we'll comment on the new Divisions that we are setting in place. And part of it will be in digital, part of it will be in Reservoir Performance Division. So, you will get more detail on this in the coming months.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Voie with Wells Fargo. And your line is open.
Chris Voie: First question, just a little bit of a clarification, sorry if I missed this. But I believe your opening remarks on the outlook suggested flat quarter-to-quarter in the fourth quarter. Is it fair to assume that, that applies at the EBITDA line, so just north of $1 billion?
Olivier Le Peuch: That's a fair assumption. I think we have some favorable and unfavorable play that we believe will balance out, and the ambition will be indeed to maintain roughly both the margins and the dollar, on an all about flat.
Chris Voie: And then secondly, I wonder if you could just give a little more detail on the progression for the cost savings. I guess you're exiting about 80% in the third quarter. It should be almost done in the fourth quarter, that's maybe $60-ish million incremental. Should we think there's much left in 2021 from that and is that international or, I imagine that's mostly international basis? But is there any progress there in North America as well?
Olivier Le Peuch: Stephane?
Stephane Biguet: Yes, I'll take this, Chris. There is -- yes, we were above -- quite a bit above 80%. So, there is a bit left. There will be still a bit left going into Q1. It is mostly on the international, the tail end of it. And North America is mostly complete. So, you will see a bit more push from this in Q4, but some remainder are going into the first half next year. Does this answer your question?
Chris Voie: And just to finish up on that restructuring. So, the cost of those savings is pretty light compared to expectations in the third quarter, around [$273 million]. Do you think those costs would be higher in the fourth quarter? I think expectations are near $1 billion for the second half. So, will the cost of savings be much higher in the fourth quarter?
Stephane Biguet: Yes. It's not an exact science there, to be honest. The cash outlays, they get spread out. It could be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter. However, the cash flow from operations, traditionally in the fourth quarter, also increases. So, I think we could very well end up with free cash flow, including severance, still quite positive. And if everything goes well, it could even be higher than in Q3, even though we have higher severance potentially.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons Energy. And your line is open.
Bill Herbert: At this point based upon the dialogue that you're having with your international customers, of course, international on a pro forma basis is going to be 80% of revenues once we consummate OneStim. But you mentioned strong customer engagement with regard to the dialogue that you're having for international. At this point, do you think international revenues in 2021 are up year-over-year?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think the way you look at -- we look at it, is to look at the current level of activity. And we use more or less the second half of this year as a baseline. Because I think the reset for international oil company has happened in the second quarter, for independent has happened in the second and the third and for national oil company has happened in the third. So, the reset of activity has happened in the last six months. Now we believe that we have stabilized, and we have seen it in the last few weeks, and we don't believe that, aside from seasonal impact, we don't believe that there will be structural adjustment in the short term. And that's our baseline. So, from that baseline, we will anticipate this to get an upside from that baseline and to gradually recover from that baseline [of work]. Now to compare it year-on-year, including the first quarter of this year up to the mix international second quarter, including the significant effort in Middle East to increase supply early Q2, I don't think it's realistic. We have to take a baseline of the second half of this year and project forward. And from that base build back a recovery.
Bill Herbert: Fair, but the COVID related disruptions that you witnessed in Q3, I would assume, hopefully, are not going to be as acute in 2021. But moving on, with regard to your high-grading of your portfolio, we have announced OneStim and low flow. I'm just curious in terms of what are the most tangible high grading opportunities remaining in your portfolio.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we'll continue to focus on each and every business line we have operating in North America. We have already made effort to rationalize and to make sure that we operate in the basin of North America, where we believe we can sustain a differentiation and participate fully going forward. We have made a choice to accelerate some technology access and fit-for-basin in some part of our portfolio to high-grade their performance. So, I will say that all of our portfolio the entire business line, I would say, has opportunity to improve their returns by tuning. And I think what we have done on structural reset is lifting. And the business line have improved this quarter beyond OneStim, the performance of North America business line this quarter have improved. So, we have a way to go to further improve this and to target our recovery of margin in North America. And I will say that we do that on both the growth for the market where we have strong alignment, the well construction, the production recovery, the digital and we do that on the bottom line, where we continue to use technology access or restructuring to make sure that we execute with the return we desire in this North America. So, we'll continue to gradually improve the performance, that's our goal.
Bill Herbert: What I meant by high grading, though, was additional disposition opportunities in your portfolio.
Olivier Le Peuch: I will not comment on that. I think we continue to look at every portfolio and we look at it from the light of does it bring us the growth and accretive return opportunity in the long run, or do we have a better way to monetize and to be occasionally opportunistic about this portfolio? So this is true for those portfolio there and as well as in other markets. But we'll continue to look at it and we will be disciplined to making the right decision for the shareholder here.
Operator: Thank you. We have time for one final question, and that will be from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. And your line is open, please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: I was wondering, maybe a higher level one to close it out here. So, we're about to get to look at your new reporting structure. And I know that Digital & Integration is probably the one that you have the most excitement about growing and improving earnings from. But if we remove that from the equation, when we take a look at what you guys are doing in, say the third quarter in the Reservoir Performance, Well Construction, Production Systems, et cetera. Where would you sort of point us to in the near term? And by near term I mean over the next 12 to 18 months here. Where would you see the greatest opportunities for improvement in earnings? And would you say that, that is more driven by costs or more driven by select growth opportunities in those portfolios?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, setting aside D&I, which have both a margin expansion opportunity and growth on the back of digital, indeed, I think we can look at it from Well Construction, where we believe that our market position will benefit from the return of meters drilled worldwide. And efficiency, efficiency of our platform, efficiency of our integration capability that we have formed by putting this Well Construction. So, this has an opportunity to solidify our market leadership position and expand and get the benefit of scale. The Reservoir Performance is where we combine our subsurface and our unique service that exploits both in exploration, in development and in production intervention, the power of our service connected to the reservoir and to the unique domain knowledge. So I think here, we have unique technology, a differentiation and unique domain knowledge that when the market will need to extract and be more efficient on existing assets to find the next tieback opportunity, or to exploit an existing asset to the next life extension, we have fantastic reservoir performance technology. And last is Production System. I think here this is a story of growth. This is a story of expanding horizon beyond what we have today, which is from-- and beyond, and into the midstream. This is a story of addressing the gas market opportunity and connecting the well to the subsea to the surface, and creating unique integration, integrated production system with digital as a unique element. So, recovery through Production Systems and Reservoir Performance is what we want to propose to the market.
Connor Lynagh: All right, that’s helpful. I’ll leave it there. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much, Connor. So, thank you, everyone, for having attended this call. So, before we end this call, I would like to leave you with four key takeaways. Third quarter was another quarter of operational and financial outperformance, made possible by discipline in execution. We made significant progress on the execution of our strategy, with key milestones in restructuring, North America strategy, and expanding the reach of our digital platform. The reset of our earnings power is progressing very well. We anticipate significantly improved operational leverage when we put the trough behind us and activity rebounds, providing us with a platform to materially expand our EBITDA margins and earnings. The quarter was another strong free cash flow performance in the cycle trough, a meaningful step closer to our double-digit free cash flow ambition that will support our priority on deleveraging our balance sheet. Lastly, the deployment of our new customer-focused organization and our fit-for-basin approach provide us with a great platform to capitalize on the market recovery and deliver on this path. In conclusion, we are executing our performance strategy and our determined to continue taking bold actions to secure resilience and reposition ourselves as clear leaders—both in performance measured by our customers and in returns measured by our shareholders. Thank you.
ND Maduemezia: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call. Operator, you may now disconnect.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-24 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second-Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. For today's agenda, Olivier will start the call with his perspectives on the quarter and our updated view of the industry macro, after which, Stephane will give more details on our financial results. Then we will open up to your questions. As always, before we begin, I’d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second-quarter press release, which is on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for joining us on the call. Today, in my prepared remarks, I would like first to review the company’s performance during the second quarter, then offer commentary on the short-term outlook, and finally reflect on where we stand in our performance strategy vision. As we close one of the most difficult quarters in our industry, I want first to thank the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience, performance, and dedication during these unique circumstances and express my pride not only in what we have achieved, but also in what we contributed for the health of the communities where we work and live. Reflecting on the quarter’s performance, I would like to comment on four key attributes that clearly made this quarter unique in its achievements: operational performance, margins, cash and liquidity, and digital. First, our operational performance supported our best-ever safety and service quality performance on record. Indeed, our frequency of safety incidents reduced nearly 50% from a year ago, whilst our service quality improved nearly 40% year-on-year—to reach a new benchmark in integrity performance for our customers. This is an attribute of our performance vision that is becoming a clear differentiator in execution, and very well acknowledged by our customers. Second is the strength of our operating margins—with 18% decremental margins despite the most severe and abrupt activity drop. These margins resulted primarily from the combination of swift actions on variable costs and the decision to accelerate the restructure of the company. This new organizational structure of four divisions aligned with our customers’ key workflow and five key basins of activity, is significantly leaner and more responsive, adapted to the new industry normal, and strategically aligned with our performance vision. Internationally, the impact of these decisive actions also combined with progress on our capital stewardship program and continued industry adoption of new technology, particularly reservoir evaluation and digital solutions. As a consequence, the margins of our international franchise remained remarkably resilient, flat sequentially, despite the material revenue contraction and the adverse margin impact from the major disruption in Ecuador. As outlined in the earnings release, the majority of our GeoMarkets and three out of four business segments either expanded or maintained margins internationally, clearly demonstrating the strength of our franchise and the resilience of our earnings power. In North America, we accelerated the restructuring initiated last year with emphasis on scale-to-fit and the asset-light business model with significant permanent reductions to fixed and infrastructure costs. At this point, we have shutdown about 150 of our facilities and continue to make progress on the technology access franchise. In short, we readied the business for a market of smaller scale and lower-growth outlook, but with higher returns. Third, the cash flow performance was extremely solid during the quarter, building on very strong cash flow from operations and leveraging the aggressive reduction of our capital spending. In fact, cash flow was still strong even when excluding working capital and accounting for the significant negative impact of severance payments during the quarter. Similarly, the liquidity position of the company significantly improved during Q2, while debt was visibly lower year-over-year. The attention to liquidity and cash preservation has been a very clear focus for the entire management team and finance function during the last several months, and I’m quite satisfied to have navigated this very difficult quarter with such a positive outcome. Finally, the adoption of digital, both internally and externally, is becoming a major - factor of performance and was very impactful during the second quarter operationally and financially. Internally, we made significant improvement in the deployment of digital operations particularly remote operations and digital inspections, as the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions created a catalyst for further adoption. Our drilling remote operations expanded over 25% during the quarter to exceed two-thirds of our drilling activity. We have drilled 1,250 wells in Q2 using our remote operations capability, supported by more than 250 remote operations engineers. In addition, we are now performing over 1,000 digital inspections per week, applied to maintenance, manufacturing, or integration applications across more than 40 countries, leveraging our digital backbone infrastructure. Therefore during the quarter, digital operations had a magnifying impact lowering the cost of service delivery, the size of operating crews, and increasing efficiency across operations lifecycle, hence contributing to our operating margins. Externally, we saw greater adoption of our open digital platform for both subsurface and operations solutions. The diversity and depth of digital solutions deployed with our customers, as described in several examples in our earnings release, reflects the growing maturity of the digital transformation in our industry and the success of our DELFI platform. We are extremely proud to be associated with ExxonMobil for the deployment of DrillPlan and DrillOps digital solutions to transform drilling planning and operations including automation. We share the same vision for the future of our industry, with ambition to deliver faster and lower-cost wells through digital technology. As digitalization is accelerating, we are also seeing continued progress in technology adoption despite the challenging context, as fit-for-basin and performance-focused technology generate significant efficiency gains for our customers. All in all, this quarter promised to be messy from an activity outlook, and it certainly was. However, the performance and resilience of our team, our decisive actions to preserve cash and margins, and the continued execution of our strategy, including digital, have delivered a very strong outcome, resetting the company’s competitiveness, and enabling us to operate with resilient margins in a structurally smaller market. Now let me turn to the short-term outlook. Given the uncertainties regarding the pace of economic and oil demand recovery, the range of activity outcomes for the second half of the year is still wide. However, with what we know and see today, we expect the global activity decline to recede into a soft landing in the coming months, absent further negative impact from COVID-19 on economic recovery or escalating rig activity disruptions. In the North America market, there is an uptick of DUC completions activity in the U.S., contrasted by the slow, but continued decline on both land and offshore rig activity. The frac rebound is expected to last until the seasonal decline at year-end, provided commodity pricing remains stable. International activity outlook appears mixed due to seasonal effect across the different basins. However, it’s still indicative of slight sequential contraction - for drilling activity during Q3, particularly for deepwater and exploration. With this combined North America and international activity outlook and based on our position in the respective markets, we anticipate revenue to remain essentially flat sequentially on a global basis, with a slight positive uptick internationally, offset by flat- to low-single-digit decline in North America. In this context, and absent of any new setback due to COVID-19, we expect EBITDA and operating income to grow and the respective margins to expand during Q3, above and beyond the positive impact of impairment charges. These margins will benefit from the combination of incremental restructuring cost savings during the second half of the year, tailwind from the recovery of activity in Ecuador, and continued execution of our capital stewardship strategy. While we continue to navigate the trough of this cycle, we are actually setting an inflection point in our margins’ performance, ahead of the recovery and despite the backdrop of a significantly smaller market size. Cash flow performance in the coming quarter will continue to benefit from the tailwind of our aggressive capital spend adjustment, focus on working capital efficiency, and incremental cash savings from our restructuring program. Our ambition in the second half remains positive free cash flow despite anticipated severance payments. Put another way, in a flattening activity outlook for the next two or three quarters, our ambition is to execute on a path of visible margin recovery and robust free cash flow generation as we transition into 2021. We embarked on a new strategy less than one year ago, but market conditions created a catalyst to accelerate the restructuring of the company to align with our performance vision. The early results of this strategic execution are already visible in our operational performance, our financial results, and in the alignment with the new industry landscape. Our mid to long-term financial targets remain intact and clearly focused on returns. I believe that the steps accomplished during the quarter not only solidify our vision, but also created a clear path to restore margins and returns performance despite a structurally smaller market. And now I will hand the call to Stephane, who will discuss Q2 financials and the impact of our cost-out program in a bit more detail.
Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.05. This represents a decrease of $0.20 sequentially and $0.30 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $3.7 billion of pretax charges. These charges primarily relate to workforce reductions, the impairment of an APS investment, and excess assets. You can find details of the components in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. Other than the $1 billion of severance, the rest of the charges are largely non-cash. The charge relating to severance covers both the permanent fixed-cost reductions we are implementing as part of the Company restructuring as well as the variable headcount reductions we are executing to adjust to the reduced level of activity. It is important to note that these impairments were all recorded as of the end of June. Therefore, our second quarter results did not include any benefit from reduced expenses as a result of these charges. However, going forward, the impact of the Q2 charges will result in reduced depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $80 million on a quarterly basis, while lease expense will be reduced by $25 million. Approximately $70 million of this quarterly pretax reduction will be reflected in the Production segment. The remaining $35 million will be reflected amongst the Characterization, Drilling, and Cameron segments. The quarterly after-tax impact of these reductions is approximately $0.07 in EPS terms. I will now summarize the main drivers of our second-quarter results. Overall, our second-quarter revenue of $5.4 billion decreased 28% sequentially. Pretax segment operating margins decreased 303 basis points to 7.4%. The swift actions we have taken to reduce variable costs combined with the early results of our restructuring and structural cost-reduction efforts resulted in decremental margins of less than 20% both sequentially and year-over-year. As a reminder, our restructuring program will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed costs, with more than half relating to our international businesses. For the sake of clarity, let me highlight that these are true cash savings. They do not take into account the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of impairment charges. We have achieved approximately 40% of this $1.5 billion target in the second quarter. And we aim to complete the large majority of the remainder before the end of the year. This will provide a strong tailwind to our margins in the second half of the year and into 2021. Now looking at our results by business segment, second-quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 20% sequentially, while margins increased 357 basis points to 7.6% (sic) [17.6%]. The revenue decrease was due to customers curtailing discretionary exploration-related expenditures. However, margins expanded as a result of the implementation of prompt cost reduction measures and the resilience of our digital businesses. The adoption of new Wireline technology also contributed to the margin increase. Drilling revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 24%, while margins fell by 289 basis points to 9.6%. These decreases were primarily driven by a sharp decline in the North America land rig count and COVID-related restrictions in Latin America, Africa, and Europe. Production revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 40% sequentially, and margins fell 630 basis points to 1.5%. These declines were largely a result of a sharp drop in pressure pumping activity in North America land. Additionally, a production interruption in Ecuador that was caused by a major landslide resulted in a revenue reduction this quarter of approximately $100 million in our Asset Performance Solutions or APS business. This had a significant albeit temporary impact on our decremental margins. Largely as a result of this production interruption, partially offset by the effects of the Q2 impairment, we anticipate APS amortization expense will increase by approximately $40 million next quarter. Finally, Cameron revenue of $1 billion decreased 19% while margins decreased by 180 basis points to 7.9% as international margin expansion partially offset the impact of the severe activity decline in North America land. Let me now turn to our liquidity. I was very pleased with our cash flow generation during the second quarter, given the environment we were operating in. We generated $803 million of cash flow from operations and $465 million of free cash flow. Both of these amounts are higher than last quarter, despite making $370 million of severance payments during the second quarter. As a result, we ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.6 billion. Our net debt at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion, an increase of $479 million compared to last quarter, but down almost $1 billion when compared to the same time last year. During the quarter, we spent $251 million on CapEx and invested $61 million in APS projects. Our total capital spend for 2020, including APS and multi-client, will now be approximately $1.5 billion. This represents a 45% decrease as compared to 2019, mostly coming from lower CapEx in North America and reduced investments in APS projects. Our total APS investments for 2020 was revised down to about $300 million. Despite the second quarter being the most challenging quarter in our modern history, we were still able to take steps to further strengthen the balance sheet. We issued €1 billion of 1.375% notes due 2026, $900 million of 2.65% notes due 2030, and €1 billion of 2% notes due 2032. By issuing these notes at attractive rates, we were able to retire approximately $1.5 billion of bonds that were coming due in the next four quarters. It also allowed us to pay down existing commercial paper, providing us with additional flexibility. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Therefore, after considering the $3.6 billion of cash on hand, as well as $6.2 billion of undrawn credit facilities, we had approximately $9.8 billion of liquidity available to us at the end of the quarter. This represents an increase of $3 billion from where we ended last quarter. In light of this available liquidity and the various actions we have taken during the quarter, our debt maturity profile over the next 24 months is quite manageable. We only have $500 million of bonds coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another $665 million coming due in the third quarter of 2021. The next maturity after that will only come in August 2022. Before I conclude, let me say a quick word about our financial reporting going forward. The corporate reorganization we are undertaking is a significant exercise that will take some time to fully implement. Therefore, we will continue to report our results for the third quarter consistent with our historical practices. Starting with the fourth quarter, we will report our results on the basis of the four new divisions. We will continue to disclose revenue on a geographic basis quarterly in line with our historical format in other words, split between North America, Latin America, ECA, and the Middle East. Going forward, once a year and in connection with our fourth-quarter and full-year earnings release, we will disclose pretax operating income split between North America and the rest of the world. These margins will include the results of the Cameron businesses. Shortly after we issue our third-quarter earnings release, we will provide historical pro forma financial information based upon the new division structure as well as the annual geographic margins to assist you with your modeling. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, thank you. Thank you, Stephane. So I think we are ready to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: So clearly digital technologies are gaining a lot of traction as the industry accelerates, intensifies its digital journey, and you guys are, of course leading this charge here. Could you perhaps break out how much of your revenue and earnings comes from digital today and what the - what your plans are for that percentage in the future?
Olivier Le Peuch: Well, thank you, James. So, I think as we commented before, I think, we are not ready to disclose the detail of our revenue and margin contribution, net contribution from the digital business. Suffice to say that I think it has been accretive from the growth. It has been - the segment of our business that has been declining the least in the last quarter. It has been the one that has seen the most expansion of margin as well during the quarter. So, I think it is material to our business. Our ambition remains the same. We want to double this business in the midterm, double its size. And I think we will use for that two avenue - three avenues, the avenues of subsurface digital platform, where we are doing this transition to cloud-based DELFI solution with our customers, and I think we are already seeing a lot of traction into that space. And I think this will give us new revenue stream of IT infrastructure cloud operation in addition to transformation services for every customer that we transition. Secondly, we want to open a new business around data, and be it on the analytics or be it on the subsurface or operational data that we start to offer our platform for data exchange or for trading those data. So, we have introduced GAIA as a platform, and I think we are seeing success through national data rooms, as you have seen in Egypt, and other place in the world. So, I think that's a second new revenue stream that we are developing. And finally, digital operation. I think you have seen recent announcement of the partnership we have with - we have developed with Exxon, and you are about to hear more in the future. We'll continue to lead in this drilling operation as well as production operation with Sensia, our partner, our JV. And I think these are the three revenue streams that we are developing compared to one we had before. So, this will give us the opportunity to expand in multiple facets and not only into the license for subsurface application.
James West: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. As we transition to digital, understanding that your costs are lower, but also the customer fees are lower cost, is the ultimate EBITDA dollars, the absolute dollars, are they higher or lower?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, no doubt, I think with this growth and accretive margin, it would be higher. I think using the benefits - the benefits from digital will also benefit our customer. That's the reason why we are seeing this adoption, because they realize that they extract efficiency, they transform their own operational workflow, and as such, reduce the total cost of the - in the life cycle of the operation. So, we will benefit, they will benefit. We believe, we have the edge. We are ahead of our competitors. And we own the platform that the industry is adopting. So that will give us sustainable differentiation.
Operator: And our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Olivier, the cost reduction plan is robust. No one doubts, Schlumberger's ability to execute as we saw in the second quarter. As we've discussed in the past, the medium term, you can't really cut your way to prosperity. So it will be great if we could maybe learn more about how you plan to approach the next cycle. Last cycle, the service sector led with discounts to customers, and that was not least the large-cap diversifieds. I'm sure you received the same request this time around. As you're going to execute well on the cost-out program, looking beyond that, how do we defend the top line trajectory of the coming cycle.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, Sean. And I think you have to realize that the - compared to the last cycle, I think things have changed. And first and foremost, I think the margins have been reset for the whole industry. The pricing concession have been steep, and we have not recovered from this pricing from the last cycle. So I think first, there is not much that we can give and share. And I think the approach that we are taking with our customers, actually engage collaboratively across the full life cycle of their operation and eliminate waste and focus on engaging to reduce cost of service delivery jointly. And I think we are seeing success in this approach. We are being awarded an expanded scope when we succeed into eliminating costs and eliminating waste across the value chain. So, you will see more of this approach and less of a pricing because the industry doesn't have much to give. And I think our customer realize this. And I think we are working more collaboratively than we had in the last five years on this. And I believe that the margins expansion that we are realizing or the resilience of the margin we are realizing today will be something that we'll be able to keep and build upon as the recovery will start to happen.
Sean Meakim: Thank you for that. I think that makes sense. Then I guess, as we look out what maybe a couple of years away, but at some point, there'll be another large tender that will hit the market. And I think that's probably where the rubber meets the road to some degree. How do you think - how do you think about the competitive dynamics for those large multi-year tenders that have always been kind of the thorn in the side of the sector?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, the lesson learned from this, I think, is the industry has learned to be capital disciplined. And I think we have learned, all of us. And I think, we have suffered from some of the steps we took as an industry. And I think, the capital discipline that I have seen and that we are using today, I think is very prominent in many place. And I think we have been having a very strict capital stewardship program, where we make a clear choice on the, I would say, allocating capital where we see returns. And as such, we are grading the opportunity that comes our way. And I believe some of our competitors are applying the same approach as the return are not acceptable the way they were and the way they have been at the trough. So I think the capital discipline is something that has changed. And I think expect that the capital discipline will be an element of success in the future. Now this being said, very large tender, very large scope that have a runway for multi-years will be competitive. But I think we'll demonstrate we have the most competitive cost platform to operate those large contracts and we'll be able to retain margins in those conditions.
Operator: And next we have a question from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: So around your Q3 guidance for EBITDA and operating income to be up, can you share any additional thoughts around magnitude as far as margins and the bottom line? And then the levers within those numbers, how does Ecuador factor into these numbers as it comes back as well as the furlough employees coming back? And any additional thoughts around the APS tariffs in Ecuador given oil prices?
Olivier Le Peuch: Let me - Angie, let me offer some very qualitative comments, and I will let Stephane add if he believe that we need to add. So first, I don't think we are in a position where we would like to give quantitative guidance on these. I think considering the level of uncertainty in the mix that could, as we have seen in the second quarter, have changed dramatically partly internationally. I don't think I will go further on a quantitative guidance going forward. But I think we are seeing positive and negative. Obviously, on the positive side, we are seeing the fall through, the incremental impact of our restructuring costs that will continue to fall into a tailwind for our margins. We'll also see, obviously, the return of our Ecuador activity, as you have heard, $100 million impact on the top line. That will come back both EBITDA and margins -- and operating margins in the third quarter. And at the same time, I think the execution that we have seen happening on capital stewardship and success of technology, including digital will also be an uplift. Now, this would be partially offset and one of them will be the top line measure that we took, exceptional measure we took during the second quarter, will not be there again. But I think as a mix, you understand that this will lift our margin despite a top line flat.
Stephane Biguet: Just to add, Olivier, maybe one additional factor on top of the incremental fixed cost savings is also that the full quarter effect of the large headcount reductions we executed in Q2. The exit rates of those headcount reduction was much larger than the average. So we'll have that tailwind as well.
Angie Sedita: And then I mean you really had impressive results in Reservoir Characterization as far as margins. Can you talk a little bit around how much of that was driven by cost cutting versus the impact of digital and maybe even Wireline? And when could we start to see the similar transformation across your other businesses?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, very good question I think the - first I think Reservoir Characterization is certainly the one that is the least –having the least exposure to North America as a benefit - had a benefit on international. As I did mention, three out of the four business group had flat or expanding margin internationally and that was the case for Reservoir Characterization. Now to be specific, I would say that a little bit more than half, I will say, came from this aggressive action we take on the structure and cost reduction. But I think the other half came from a technology adoption. And technology adoption, Reservoir Evaluation from Wireline with Ora as the platform of service continue to be very, very successful in the campaign of the - even if we have less exploration activity, we are able to deploy this new technology with much success, and it was the highest quarter in terms of revenue for that new technology Ora. And digital, so I will say that, it's a technology success as much and technology adoption success as much as a cost structure. So, the other segment have technology - and I think and we'll continue to succeed as well. So, I'm not worried about our ability to grow margin in every business group. But obviously, we benefited more from the differentiation of our technology in Reservoir Characterization.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Stephane, can you walk through a few of the major cash items over the next few quarters, specifically with regard to working cap? What are your expectations for the size of the traditional second half release? And then what are your expectations for cash severance in the second half? And how does that split between 3Q and 4Q?
Stephane Biguet: Sure, sure, good morning. Look for the second half, we actually expect our cash flow from operations to remain very strong, even if indeed, you're right, the working capital release will not be as large as it was in Q2, because activity - if we assume activity stabilizing, as we said, in the second half. However again, we’ve already shown all fixed-cost cash savings materializing in the rest of the year and the reduced intensity of our capital spend. We think we can still generate positive free cash flow in the second half, despite the additional severance payments that we will incur. And to your question, we think we will incur on most of the remaining severance payments in the second half of the year.
Scott Gruber: And we should think about - is the $1 billion less the $370 million paid in the second quarter in terms of what's remaining for cash severance? Is that the way to think about it?
Stephane Biguet: Yes, you can put a little bit more because we had $200 million of provisions at the end of March as well.
Scott Gruber: Okay. And then just on the cost-out program. You mentioned realizing about 40% of the $1.5 billion during the second quarter. Is that a full quarter impact, or was that realized by quarter end and then just some color on realizing majority of the remainder in the second half? Is that fairly linear, or is it more weighted towards 3Q or 4Q?
Stephane Biguet: So, it is a full quarter impact, meaning that the Q2 results include the 40%, and we exited the quarter actually at a much higher rate. So this is why we have a nice tailwind starting into Q3 and going into Q4 with the remaining 60%. Most of it is - a lot of it is already realized at the end of- or triggered at the end of the quarter.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: So, in a world of record OPEC spare capacity and inventory which can largely meet the rising call on OPEC output over the next two years, how should we think about the uptake for RCG services given the low hanging fruit with regard to monetizing production?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think the RCG the Reservoir Characterization Group, I think has multiple aspect to it. I think, one is the digital. And I think this one, independently of the trajectory of the recovery of the supply-demand balance will continue to benefit from the digital transformation that is happening in our industry. When it comes to the Wireline, the Testing, the reservoir evaluation aspect, I think you have to look at two aspects; one is first, exploration still is happening and will continue to happen. There were more than 100 wells explored during the offshore during the second quarter, and there will be more than 100 wells, exploration wells in the first quarter. And hence the ability we have, the differentiation and technology with platforms such as Ora will continue to be providing us support and sustain margin in this environment. Secondly, Reservoir Characterization also does characterization for producing reservoir, so that when there is a short-cycle upside of trying to extract more from existing reservoir without exploring. We are applying technology for intervention, we are applying technology for testing of the reservoir, so that we can optimize. And I think we have seen actually more resilience of that Wireline intervention production services during the quarter than on the evaluation services during the last quarter. So, I'm reading this, I'm optimistic and quite reassured that the portfolio we have is well balanced and include for Reservoir Characterization production-related technology that will make a difference as our customer will go back into extracting more from the reservoir and the producing field they have.
Bill Herbert: And then Stephane, with regard to, I guess, depreciation, did you say that Q3, that total depreciation would be down $80 million quarter-on-quarter?
Stephane Biguet: Yes, it will be from the impairment effect. However, you will also see excuse me, you will also see a reversal coming from the Ecuador landslide incident that will partially offset this effect. But from impairment totally - yes, go ahead, Scott.
Bill Herbert: So the net impact, we had $604 million in Q2. Approximately, what do you think the number and the guidance is for Q3?
Stephane Biguet: It is not going to be so far from Q2, if you assume the same revenue levels we have.
Operator: And our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: So Olivier, I was wondering, if you can, potentially give us a little bit more color around what maybe - what you may see happening in terms of business dynamics in the Middle East. There has been a couple other earnings reports from some of your competitors this week. It seems like there is some mixed messages in terms of overall level of activity and I guess, still some discussion around some pricing concession dynamics? So, you gave us some good color on Latin America and kind of what to expect in Ecuador. So just hoping you can give us some of that same kind of color and context on the Middle East?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, thank you. So, I think the Middle East activity is seeing indeed a unique mix. The reason for this is that as part of the OPEC plus commitment and the compliance. There were decisions made during the second quarter for several of the national company, operating in Middle East to contain the activity and to reduce activity including rig activity or rigless activity during the third quarter. So, this is impacting several country and in particular, Saudi. So, the number of rigs that the study was operating at beginning of the year compared to where it is operating now, they will be more than 40 rigs down from January to June, and another nine or 12 rig possibly will go down in the third quarter. So, no doubt that there is a decline by the effect of the transition exit rate from Q2, as well as some further contraction of activity in the third quarter. That's true for that country. So depending on the exposure you have in Middle East, it can be significant or it can be offset. In our case, we are offsetting this by gain of activity or share in specifically Qatar and Kuwait. And as such, the overall outlook for us on Middle East is relatively flat on a sequential basis where, indeed, the underlying rig activity sequentially will go down 6% to 7% across the region. But depending on the - so yes, the activity is going down sequentially, no doubt. And it will not be corrected because of the decision of last week OPEC plus agreement to reinstall-- restore the 1.9 million-barrel cut. This was already factored when those activity cuts were decided. And hence, I'm not expecting any impact on this. So, yes, mix down. However, depending on the market exposure we, in our case, are able to hold our top line relatively flat in that context.
Kurt Hallead: That's great. And then my follow-up is you made a reference that given the cost-out dynamics execution and so on that you would expect your operating income margins and EBITDA to improve, obviously in the third quarter. But it seems like there is going to be some built in momentum in the system that could carry you over into the fourth quarter, even if there is some seasonal decline in revenue? So just wanted to kind of test my theory on that to see if that's true, and then as part of that, I was also curious as to what business segment do you think has the best - will show the best improvement in EBITDA margins as you get through the second half of the year?
Olivier Le Peuch: Good question. I think the first we do confirm that our ambition is to indeed on a flat outlook, absent of a significant setback that would come from a reversal of the pandemic situation. But, and considering the forward looking, there will be some seasonal effect. So, it's very early to give a perspective on the top line evolution from third quarter to fourth quarter. But assuming that the current directional soft lending of activity continues well into the fourth quarter we will expect indeed this benefit to carry through and this margin expansion to be consistent and to still hold both from EBITDA and from the operating margin in the fourth quarter. So that's correct, and I think that - we are supporting this. I don't think we are in a position where we can project, and we want to detail and give guidance on the business segment outlook beyond next quarter. We expect them to indeed solidify and expand margin next quarter. But I think to go beyond that there will be some end-of-year effect that could twist some of the fall through. But overall, on a global basis, at the company level, this is what we're expecting.
Operator: And next we have a question from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: I have a bigger-picture question for you. But I want to ask you, a quick question first on the near-term, particularly on the Middle East. You talked about mix being an issue there, but in terms of the rigs going down, is it mostly oil? I'm just curious if you can just talk about the mix between oil and gas? Is gas still kind of largely maintained there? And secondarily, is there much impact on this on your LSTK contracts at all? You didn't really get into that at all. I'm just wondering if there is any impact there?
Olivier Le Peuch: So, the first measure during the third quarter - the second quarter have been obviously on oil. However, there have been some side affect on gas because of budget reduction so budget constraints have led to a reduction of activity in gas as well. But what, to be specific, I’m sorry The gas LSTK contract indeed have reduced significantly. I'm not talking about the unconventional, but the conventional gas operation frac coil tubing rigless operation. And this has reduced to a new floor and this will possibly rebound. But yes, gas was affected for us the drilling LSTK by contract was unaffected. Probably because the performance of those LSTK contract is differentiated and there is a mix of oil or gas LSTK drilling contract and both were actually sustained and I've not been impacted at this point. And we don't expect to be the case. So that's - just to give you a little bit of more growth.
David Anderson: That's great, thank you very much. So, my bigger-picture question is sort of going looking back in history here a bit. When we talk about the cycles, it seems to be in 1986 is kind of a clear parallel to kind of what we're going through now, not only in terms of magnitude, but kind of how we got here in lot of respects. Now you started Schlumberger in 1987 and just like now, Schlumberger was going through a pretty major management change at the time? But as that cycle slowly regained its footing, Schlumberger really accelerated of the downturn, set the company up for another decade of success. So my question is, as you look back at those days in the late 80s and early 90s, and I'm sure you've studied your predecessors during those times, I'm just wondering kind of what are some of the big lessons that you learned about how to position the company what to focus on? And really I guess, what were kind of the keys to success back then - that you're thinking about now as the cycle resets?
Olivier Le Peuch: So first, I'm not old enough to comment on 1986 apparently. So no, Dave I think if we step back, I think the industry has a proportion to go into crisis and rebound. So, no doubt that this industry will engineer or innovate its way up to the current crisis, no doubt. I think the characteristics on the other side of this cycle will be different from what we have known in the last 10 to 15 years. And I think capital efficiency, capital discipline, efficiency cost of service delivery would be the prime element of differentiation. So, we’re now talking about technology, we'll talk about technology that impacted performance across the lifecycle that impact efficiency hence, the fast adoption of digital will be differentiation. So, when you look back on cost okay, the success we had historically was clearly on expanding our international franchise and being the service company that could create value and find hydrocarbon reserve and help developed those reserves everywhere in the world in any condition. I think the game has changed this is not about finding new supply. It’s produced this supply at a lower cost. I think on occasion, it would be short-cycle extraction of the next drop. On occasion, it will be finding the next advantage, offshore, deepwater, large basin. Hence technology will always make a difference, but it would be focused on performance impact efficiency, and this would change the game. The second aspect I think - and digital obviously is part of this, changing the cost of sales delivery, changing our efficiency factor. The second aspect is I believe, I truly believe that industry is recognizing. And we are having better engagement today than maybe we had in the past. Of course, the necessity to integrate and partner across the supply chain and supply chain across on the service side and from supply to operator, to align in partnership that will transcend and create the game change we need. Because we need to transform as an industry, we need to find a way to extract this capital efficiency by standardization, by changing the way we operate, by transforming the way we digitally align with our operators and across the service industry. So partnership across the supply chain to really step change capital efficiency across the lifecycle and the technology that have differentiated per basin, focused on performance and focused on lowering the cost of service delivery. This is what I think will be the winning factor in the future.
David Anderson: I would also imagine that R&D spend is critical as well, right. I mean that's one of the things I've noticed over the decades?
Olivier Le Peuch: Obviously.
David Anderson: That R&D spend is critical?
Olivier Le Peuch: Obviously, as I said, I think the industry will innovate its way. And innovation will come from the way we reinvent ourselves, including this partnership, this transformation, operational transformation. But obviously, there will be a very key element of technology. We will have to invent the next and continue to lead on our digital - and invent the technology that will transform operationally the performance of the asset of our customer, step change the efficiency of finding oil and automate the drilling operations. So that will come through technology investment. And no doubt that will continue and we’ll invest into this to make it happen.
Operator: And our next question is from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: I was wondering, if you could sort of frame something for me here. I think the pace of cost reductions and in many cases, structural cost reductions has surprised a lot of observers of the industry. And I guess what everyone is trying to figure out is how sustainable or how scalable these cost savings are. So, if you could characterize the $1.5 billion of cost savings. Are you thinking of your business as able to reach the same revenue levels as previously? Are you not interested in reaching the same revenue levels that you had in say 2018 or 2019, because some of it was so returns-dilutive? How do you think about the ability of the organization to respond to higher activity levels, if and when we get there?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. First, Connor, I think, we had to realize - and I think this realization has been across the whole industry, that I think we are transitioning into a new normal. And the new normal means that the market for the foreseeable short term will be structurally smaller in size. So, I think we have to make that realization. Whether we call it 25%, 30%, 35% smaller in size, it depends on the region and the business, but I think that's a reality that is leading us. So, I think that was the first and foremost realization. The second one we have realized and hence the decision that we have made to restructure the company to adjust and align with this new reality and to right-size our structure, including our support fixed structure to account for this. This doesn't say that we are not ready for growth. We're absolutely ready for growth. But I think that we believe that the transformation we are going through, the capital efficiency, resource efficiency that we have enabled in the last three years to four years and the digital transformation we're going through in our operation todaywill create the leverage that we need to add future growth at much limited - much more limited resource and our capital needs in the future. So, I believe that the asset velocity, the capital efficiency we'll play out. Now this being said, we will be very strict on our capital stewardship program, and as such indeed made the right choice to not deploy capital and resource when we believe that the return are not in place. And I think we have started to do this. And we are successful in doing this, and we continue to do so. But at the end, we will grow. The recovery is on the horizon. When and as it recovers, we'll be ready with a different shape, a different structure, a new company, be it in the North America market, where we will changing to an asset-lite technology access model and scale-to-fit approach or internationally, where we are more focused on performance, and we are getting success out of this, and we'll accelerate our digital transformation. So yes, we will, and we believe that this structure will be giving us more flexibility as well as we'll have the core digital and transformation capability to flex with an upturn at a better incrementals.
Connor Lynagh: I guess I would extend basically the same question to a point you were making, which is a lot of the things you're doing will make the business more capital-light. Is there a way that you can frame for people how the capital intensity or the CapEx needs as a percentage of sales, however you think of it, could look on a go forward basis relative to what we saw in the previous cycle here.
Stephane Biguet: I think we have been in 5% to 7% as a guidance that we have been consistent with. And I think that – we believe that we'll be able, as the market returns, to-- after completing some of the transformation for asset-light and technology access to continue on this 5% to 7%. We are comfortable on this. And that's the guidance we keep.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have one final question from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchi: Olivier, you mentioned a soft landing for international in third quarter. I think there's a lot of questions from investors about budget resets and you know what we've seen so far internationally this year and if there's incremental risks to 2021. Are you comfortable saying that absent seasonality that we usually see in the first quarter that international has bottomed in the second quarter of 2020?
Olivier Le Peuch: It's too early to say Marc, I think what I'm saying is that the - for this year, the effect of the budget adjustments and the COVID disruption that were budget the significant decline 22% rate decline in the second quarter. These two conditions especially receding and subdued as we go forward. We don't anticipate significant further budget cuts at the current pace. This however is truly to say whether the consequence on the budget setting in 2021 if the market was if the market was indicative of a slow, but steady recovery scenario that we’ll according to many of the analysts, IEA, and others to indicate a exit rate at $50 or $60 in 2020 for the Brent. In 2021 obviously this will certainly support a steady 2021 compared to the H2 on right of activity internationally. But this is too early to say and I think we have to wait, the budget cycle and also obviously, three to four months of more economic recovery of pandemic containment to judge what 2021 demand-supply balance could be, and what the condition for the budget will be in 2021.
Marc Bianchi: Okay, well, maybe following up on that thought about 2021. If I sort of take the run rate level of EBITDA that you have here it's about 3.3 billion and we've got another 900 million of cost savings that should be realized, you're kind of on a $4.2 billion annualized rate. As you look to 2021 understanding there's a lot of uncertainty, what would you say are the biggest factors that, you know, could be driving that higher or lower?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think obviously the pace of economic recovery, the anticipated demand and supply balance, and the repercussion it will have on the confidence of the operator to invest or reinvest, I think is the major factor that will shape the turn of 2021. So, again, if it is a run rate of H2 times two, we expect to sustain whatever we will produce in the second half, and multiply by two, that is the correct assumption. But again, the risk, I think, comes down to the demand supply more than anything else. North America is a little bit of a wild card and we don't expect this to be a significant year, but it will be up most likely as a slow but steady recovery, but will not come back to the heyday. So I think overall, I think you have the gallons, but the factor is predominantly the economic outlook and the demand-supply - the impact on demand-supply prediction. And we cannot comment more than this at this point.
Marc Bianchi: Fair enough, thanks very much. I'll turn it back.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Marc. So I believe we are the - it's time to close. So to close let me let me leave you with three points. Firstly, our Q2 performance reflects the decisiveness and depth of our cost adjustments and cash preservation actions. I'm very pleased with the operational performance, international margins resilience, cash flow results, and the take in digital during the quarter. Secondly, we are resetting the company structure to support our performance vision and to align with the new market reality and as such, we have initiated a clear path to restore margins and returns performance with the backdrop of a structurally smaller market. We expect this to show visibly during the second half, absent of a setback in economic recovery. Finally, our performance strategy with digital and sustainability has imperatives, and capital stewardship and fit for basin technologies as performance factors will create differentiation in this new industry landscape, and we'll support our returns ambition, particularly as the future recovery pivots towards international market. So with this, and now, before I close the call, I wish everyone and I, wish everyone a safe and happy summer. I would like to thank Simon Farrant for nearly 33 years of service, as he has elected to take an early retirement from Schlumberger. Simon has been a very familiar voice and face throughout the last six years, 26 quarters, in his role as Vice President of Investor Relations. And I trust that his unique contributions to both Schlumberger and the investor community will be greatly missed. Simon, we wish you and your family all the best. Enjoy the new chapter!
Simon Farrant: Thank you, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: ND Maduemezia, who most recently was the Sub-Sahara Africa GeoMarket Manager, will take over from Simon effective at the end of this month. I ask that you all welcome ND and extend to him the same, high level of support and professional engagement as shared with Simon. Welcome, ND.
ND Maduemezia: Thank you, Olivier. I am excited and truly honored to take on this role, and I look forward to working very closely with all of you. I turn the call over to Simon.
Olivier Le Peuch: Simon?
Simon Farrant: Well, thank you very much, Olivier. It's been an honor to serve as the Head of Investor Relations, as you say for the last 26 quarters. And I wish my good friend, ND, all the best in taking over this role. Thank you, operator, you may close the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-17 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Simon Farrant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited 2020 [First-Quarter] earnings call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. For today's agenda, Olivier will start with -- the call with his perspectives on the quarter and our updated view of the industry macro. After which, Stephane will give more details on our financial results. Then we will open up to questions. As always, before we begin, I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone is safe and well. This morning I'm going to comment on three topics: our Q1 performance; how we are managing in today’s increasingly difficult operating environment; and how we see the outlook for the second quarter.  Before I do that, I would first like to thank the Schlumberger people around the world who are demonstrating great resilience and adaptability. I’m very proud of our team and of what they have achieved in the first quarter. Despite the complications from COVID-19 outbreak, they delivered strong organizational performance throughout the quarter. We kept very close to our customer as the crisis developed and we were able to maintain well site operations with only minimal disruption across a few countries. The feedback I’ve received from our customers has been both positive and appreciative of our operational performance. Despite the difficulty of the situation and the duress under which our people have been working, Q1 was one of the best quarter in terms of service quality and actually the best quarter ever in safety performance. Let’s start with the perspective on our first quarter results. The resilience of our performance given the COVID-19 related disruption and the early impact of the oil price collapse, delivered earnings of $0.25 per share; only marginally short of our original expectation. The quarter was characterized by the usual combination of seasonal impact in the Northern Hemisphere and the sequential decline of product and software sales. However, toward the end of the quarter, activity started to decline in several basins due to the unprecedented drop in oil price and the increasing challenges posed by COVID-19. The most severe impact was in North America land where customers were fast to react with a sharp 17% cut in rig count. In our business segments, Reservoir Characterization revenue closed the quarter sequentially down 20%, partly on seasonal effects but also as a consequence of customers curtailing their discretionary and exploration spending in the latter part of the quarter. The margins declined on the absence of significant multi-client software license sales, weak exploration mix and lower contribution from discretionary software sales. Drilling revenue declined sequentially on seasonal effects and the collapse in North America late in the quarter, but displayed resilience with margins flat sequentially on our operational execution and our focus on underperforming business units as well as continued success in our technology access strategy. Production revenue declined on lower activity in international markets and weaker Asset Performance Solutions (APS) results. While Production margin declined 100 basis points driven by the weaker international activity, the success of our OneStim® scale-to-fit strategy in North America matched resource to market needs and optimize our operational footprint. Cameron revenue was seasonally lower and suffered from the exposure of the short-cycle business to North America. International Cameron revenue was also lower as we halted manufacturing in Italy and Malaysia in response to local restrictions to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Despite these negative effects, Cameron margin increased sequentially, driven largely by this quarter’s favorable mix in the OneSubsea® portfolio.  Looking at North America land in more detail, the timely acceleration of our NAL strategy protected margins from excessive sequential decline. We began the quarter having scaled our OneStim fleet to fit the market, which resulted in higher utilization and minimal frac calendar gaps. However, as oil price began to collapse in March, customers rapidly dropped rigs and frac crews. Along with well construction and completion activity decreasing, the technology mix switched from driving performance to saving costs. We reacted rapidly by stacking frac fleets to protect our margins and had reduced capacity by more than 27% and reduced our CapEx plan by 60% by the end of the quarter. In contrast, our international revenue close to 2% ahead year-on-year or 4% when accounting for the 2019 business divestitures. Growth was resilient in key Schlumberger markets across Russia & Central Asia, Saudi Arabia & Bahrain, Far East Asia & Australia, Northern Middle East, Latin America North, and Norway & Denmark. Our first quarter cash flow from operations more than doubled year-on-year to $784 million as a result of our heightened focus on collections and our resilience in key international markets. Let me now talk about what we are doing to protect the company and how we have focused on cash, liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet in a period of high uncertainty as the depth and extent of the coronavirus impact on global oil demand remains unknown. First, and after an in-depth review of the possible outcomes of the new oil order we are facing, we have made the very difficult but necessary decision to reduce our dividend by 75%. This will protect our cash and liquidity in the current environment, while giving us greater flexibility going forward. We will continue to exercise stringent capital stewardship, while retaining the ability to balance any capital return to shareholders as operational conditions evolve. Second, we have reduced our capital investment program by more than 30% across CapEx, APS and multi-client. We’re also reducing our research and engineering investment by more than 20% in the second quarter to reflect the necessary adjustment to our 2020 commercialization program. Further, we have accelerated and increased our structural cost reduction in North America in alignment with the scale-to-fit strategy initiated during the fourth quarter adjusted for the new environment. As a result, we unfortunately had to reduce our workforce in North America by close to 1,500 people during the first quarter.  We will continue to decisively implement structural change during the second quarter both in North America and internationally to align our cost base with the anticipated short-term and second half activity outlook with full understanding that the pace and scale of decline is still uncertain, but will be more abrupt than during any recent downturn. Finally, we have also taken exceptional temporary measures to conserve cash by implementing furloughs across many parts of organization, both in North America and internationally, and by reducing compensation for the executive team and for the Board of Directors. The result of these actions represents a significant step towards protecting the company cash and liquidity in the face of the significant uncertainties. I believe that our response so far has been swift and effective as demonstrated by our margin and cash flow performance during the first quarter, while providing service to all of our customers with unique resilience and performance across all basins.  Stephane will discuss the strength of our balance sheet, our access to liquidity and our capital investment program in more detail in a few minutes. Before that, let me give you our perspective for the second quarter. Despite the recent agreement by the world’s largest oil producers to cut production, Q2 is likely to be the most uncertain and disruptive quarter that the industry has ever seen. We are therefore not in a position to provide guidance for the next quarter as we face two degrees of uncertainty beyond the severe impact of oil demand contraction and the level of commodity oil price. First, it is very difficult to model or predict the frequency or magnitude of the COVID-19 disruption on field operations. Second, it is too early to judge the impact of the recent OPEC+ decision on the level of international activity, as well as its repercussion on storage level globally and the related risks of production shut-ins. Let me however share our view on the key activity trends, starting with North America. We anticipate both rig activity and frac completion activity to continue to decline sharply during the second quarter to reach a sequential decline of 40% to 60%, which matches the full year budget adjustment guidance shared by most operators in North America land. This would represent the most severe decline in drilling and completion activity in a single quarter in several decades.  Internationally, we see a less severe sequential decline as some long-cycle offshore and land development markets should remain relatively resilient and will partially offset the exploration activity drop, as well as the expected activity adjustments that would result from the OPEC+ decision. Directionally, at this time, and excluding the seasonal rebound of rig activity in Russia and China, the international rig count is expected to decline by low to mid-teens sequentially. However, this will vary greatly by basin and per customer. We have been successful during the first quarter in providing the market with resilience and performance. We anticipate building on this success, and will fully leverage our unique international franchise to retain optimum activity mix going forward. As the quarter develops and we get more clarity on the timing and shape of demand recovery and better understand the OPEC+ deal’s implementation and compliance, we will be able to discuss our outlook for the second half of the year with you. Let me conclude by reinforcing the enormity of the task ahead. It will require levels of response and depths of resilience that are yet to be fully realized. The actions we have taken so far have been focused on those things we can control in protecting our business with a clear priority on cash and liquidity in an uncertain industry and global environment. We’ll continue to take the steps necessary to protect the safety and health of our people and pursue our ambition to be the performance partner of choice for our customers.  The future of our industry poses difficult challenges for people and for the environment, but continues to offer a unique opportunity. I believe that the resilience and performance of our people, our technology leadership and our financial strength will clearly position us for success as the industry rebounds from this unprecedented downturn. On to you, Stephane.
Stephane Biguet : Thank you, Olivier. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents a decrease of $0.14 sequentially and $0.05 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $8.5 billion of pre-tax charges driven by current market conditions and valuations. These charges primarily relate to goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. As such, this charge is almost entirely non-cash. You can find details of its components in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. These impairments were all recorded as of the end of March. Therefore, the first quarter results did not include any benefit from reduced depreciation and amortization expense as a result of these charges. However, going forward, depreciation and amortization expense will be reduced by approximately $95 million on a quarterly basis. However, going forward, depreciation and amortization expense will be reduced by approximately $95 million on a quarterly basis. Approximately $45 million of this will be reflected in the Production segment. The remaining $50 million will be reflected in the ‘Corporate and other’ line item. The quarterly after-tax impact of these reductions is approximately $0.06 in EPS terms. I will now summarize the main drivers of our first quarter results. I will not go into much detail as Olivier already provided some key highlights, but I will spend more time updating you on our liquidity position. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $7.5 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Pre-tax segment operating margins decreased 181 basis points to 10.4%. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 20% sequentially, while margins decreased 839 basis points to 14%. The sequential drop was a combination of seasonal effects and early signs of customer curtailing discretionary expenditures. Drilling revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 6%, while margins were flat at 12.4%. Approximately half of that revenue decline was due to the divestiture of our Fishing & Remedial Tools business at the end of the fourth quarter. Production revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 6% sequentially, and margins declined 98 basis points to 7.8%. Cameron revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 10%, while margins slightly increased by 57 basis points to 9.7%. Our effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits was 17% in the first quarter as compared to 16% in the previous quarter. Please note that it is going to be challenging to provide guidance around our effective tax rate going forward as discussed in further detail in the FAQ at the end of our earnings release.  Let me now turn to our liquidity. During the first quarter, we generated $784 million of cash flow from operations. As Olivier mentioned, this is more than double what we generated during the same quarter last year. We spent $407 million on CapEx and invested $163 million in Asset Performance Solutions or APS projects.  We completed the sale of our interest in the Bandurria Sur Block in Argentina during the quarter. The net proceeds from this transaction combined with the proceeds we received from the divestiture of a smaller APS project, amounted to about $300 million. Looking forward, after considering the Argentina divestiture and reduction in the rest of our project portfolio, our APS investments for the full year will not exceed $500 million. With this, as well as the significant reduction of our operating CapEx engaged during the quarter, our total capital spend for 2020 including APS and multi-client will now be approximately $1.8 billion. This represents close to a 35% decrease as compared to 2019.  On the balance sheet side, we took a series of steps during the first quarter to reinforce our liquidity position. First, we ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.3 billion. While this cash balance is higher than what we generally like to carry, this was a conscious decision and I am very comfortable with it considering the current situation. Our net debt increased by only $171 million during the quarter, closing at $13.3 billion, which is more than $1 billion lower than the level we were at a year ago. During the first quarter, we issued EUR400 million of notes due in 2027 and another EUR400 million of notes due in 2031. These notes carry a weighted average interest rate of 2% after being swapped into U.S. dollars. We also renewed during the quarter our revolving credit facilities. These committed facilities amount to a total of $6.25 billion and do not mature until between February 2023 and February 2025. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Therefore, after considering the $3.3 billion of cash on hand, we had $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us at the end of the quarter. In addition, we entered last week into another committed revolving credit facility for EUR1.2 billion. This is a one year facility that can be extended at our option for up to another year. We can also upsize the facility for syndication. To-date, we have not drawn on this facility. Finally, our short-term credit ratings, which are critical to maintain our privileged access to the commercial paper markets, were just recently reaffirmed by both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. In light of our available liquidity and the various actions undertaken during the quarter, our debt maturity profile over the next 12 months is quite manageable. We only have $500 million of bonds coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another $600 million coming due in the first quarter of 2021. Our preference is to refinance these obligations with new bonds, markets permitting.  To close, let me come back to what is probably the most important decision of the quarter as it relates to capital allocation. In this environment, our strategic priority is obviously on conserving cash and further protecting our balance sheet. To this end, we have taken the prudent decision to reduce our quarterly dividend by 75%. The revised dividend still supports our shareholder value proposition by maintaining both a healthy yield and a reasonable payout ratio as we navigate these uncertain times. It also allows for prudent organic investment, while maintaining the self-discipline required under the capital stewardship program that we have committed to.  Finally, it gives us flexibility to adjust our capital return policy in the future whether through increased dividends or stock buybacks when operating and business conditions improve.  I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch : Thank you, Stephane. Thank you for this clarification. So ladies and gentlemen, I think we will open the floor for Q&A at this point.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Good morning, Olivier and Stephane. So Olivier, in terms of capital allocation strategy going forward, I know we had the dividend cut today, which is clearly a prudent move in light of the current environment, although we're going to stabilize and figure out how this market unfolds here in the next quarter or so. So how do you think about capital allocation through this downturn? Previously you guys were counter-cyclical, and getting into the SPM, you've obviously disbanded that, so I doubt that’s an area of capital. But how are you thinking about the allocation of capital?
Olivier Le Peuch: So, James, as you know, we have -- as part of the strategy, reaffirmed our capital stewardship program and that’s a strategic step -- and I think under that umbrella we did reaffirm our priority for our capital allocation. And our cash from -- free cash flow from operation typically will be directed towards three buckets. The first one, to maintain and support our ongoing operation and that’s part of what we do in the essential of under strict capital allocation for the CapEx. The second one, being obviously to maintain the strength of our balance sheet and to address the debt level that we need to maintain the right ratio. And finally, the dividend. Any excess cash beyond that, I think will be directed towards either business opportunity that represent an accretive return to our capital under the new program of capital stewardship or return distribution to the shareholder in the form of buyback or in the form of future increase of our dividend. That's the way we will continue to use the framework under these conditions. Stephane, do you want to add anything?
Stephane Biguet: You’ve covered all. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: So maybe just to follow on to that. So good to hear the updated thoughts around capital allocation. Can we then maybe just dovetail into thinking about sources and uses of cash? The balance sheet has a pretty front-loaded maturity cadence over the next couple of years. So the $4 billion that you'll keep on the balance sheet from the reduction in dividend, that certainly will help you close the Bandurria Sur …?
Olivier Le Peuch: Operator, we lost Sean.
Operator: Yes. One moment please. I apologize, Mr. Meakim, please go back ahead. Please go ahead with your question, I apologize.
Sean Meakim: So the main question is about sources and uses of cash. The balance sheet maturity cadence is pretty front load through 2023. And so it would be great to hear about how you think about sources and uses over the next couple of years to address that part of the balance sheet? Thank you. 
Stephane Biguet: For the upcoming maturities, at least in the next 12 months, as I said, we are pretty well spaced and the amounts are quite reasonable. So really what we will do is, our objective is to refinance the maturities with new bonds or if cash permits we will pay down some of that debt to maintain the credit rating that we are targeting. And what we are targeting is really to ensure that we keep a strong investment grade credit in this cyclical environment. So, this will really be the way we will deal with the upcoming maturities, if that answer your question.
Olivier Le Peuch: Sean, we have been -- on a continuous basis, we have been using bonds to refinance the maturities that are upcoming. I think we need -- as you heard Stephane today, we have two new bond that were issued during the first quarter in euro that were swapped back to dollar. And I think we had done that all along as part of our program and this was reviewed during the finance committee and there was an envelope agreed and approved by the board going forward to refinance a large amount and go after the bond market to address those. And we are confident with the current investment grade we have that we’ll be successful in tapping in those markets. 
Operator: And our next question is from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: So for Olivier or Stephane, maybe you could talk a little bit further about the cost cutting and even give us some parameters potentially around the dollar size of the cost cutting and the degree that it is fixed versus variable, if certain segments are impacted more so than others? And beyond Q2, if we look into Q3 and Q4, thoughts around decremental margins?
Olivier Le Peuch: Angie, good morning. So first I think I’ll stay quite generic in the statement I would make on purpose, because I think there is a lot of uncertainty into the level of outlook activity wise in the second half of the year. We are starting to understand where the quarter will land this quarter in North America and we are taking actions to address and right-size organization and I talked about 40% to 60%. So, you can understand that the organization will be adjusted towards that end. And I think it will affect more or less across all product lines. OneStim will be certainly rightsized on the high end of that framework. And we certainly have to execute faster the strategy of right-sizing or scale-to-fit as we call it, and when talking about the structure costs and the fixed structure costs, that's where we'll put some effort to make sure that the restructure and the fit-for-basin and the hub concentration we are putting for OneStim in the next few months will be addressed first and foremost in parallel with the variable cost action that we're taking.  So North America is fairly clear because activity’s direction and drop of activity is already well understood. Internationally, I think it varies a lot from one geography to the next. And there is still a lot of uncertainty, partly with regard to the decision by the national company to cut -- the extent to which they will cut or not. So we are more prudent in our approach internationally, but we are as well executing there and doing both the structure -- fixed structure and as well as variable in the coming weeks. So to give you a number, I don't think there's a number we can quote. The number will keep evolving, but it will be likely to be in excess of $1 billion to just talk about compensation going forward on an annual basis. And this number will certainly change as we go forward.  So all-in-all, we continue to follow the curve, as we call it, albeit this year it's steeper and evolving faster. And we're addressing both the fixed and the variable as we have done in previous downturns. 
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: I want to touch on working capital. Given your end market forecast, how should we think about working capital? Is there any way to dimension the potential benefit to cash this year or potential range of where days outstanding to land at the end of the year? And in any lessons learned from the last cycle that can help the working capital this cycle?
Stephane Biguet: Yes, Scott. We indeed expect to see our working capital winding down over the next few quarters as activity reduces. Now the magnitude of that working capital really is dependent on several factors of course, and probably the most significant -- you're asking about lessons learned here -- is the pace of cash collections we receive from our customers. So immediately as we saw the environment deteriorating, we refocused our entire organization on cash collections and you’ve seen the early signs of this through our cash flow performance in Q1. So now, as much as we are working to prevent it, we could see payments being delayed over the next few quarters. But we will keep a very close eye on this.  Now, we may see some offsets to the positive working capital effects from restructuring cash costs as we continue to adjust our structure. But definitely we will see from a normal working capital trend, we will see a release. 
Operator: And next we have a question from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Two questions related to operating cash flow. First, I'll hit the working capital one again. Typically, the downturn, your international customers are slow pay if not everybody. And if you looked at 2015, there was a consumer of cash of $500 million or close to it. Will it be a source of cash or consumer cash? And then secondly your guidance with regard to depreciation. I think I heard you say down $95 million from what Q1 or Q4? Thank you.
Stephane Biguet: Yes. So on the working capital, you're right. The first year of the previous downturn we did have a consumption from the receivables. And again, we'll try to prevent this. We know the hotspots. And we keep a close eye on it, but it’s -- there are some places where payments can be delayed for sure.  On the D&A, yes, I did say $95 million. It’s pre-tax, obviously, and it's compared to the first quarter of this year. So $95 million, lower D&A going forward from Q1 2020 reference.
Operator: Next we’re going to have question from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: I wanted to -- thank you for all the color so far in a difficult environment. I want to follow-up on a couple of specifics. First on Reservoir Characterization, you had pretty substantial decline in margins in the first quarter here. And wanted to get a sense as to what may have been driving that and to whether or not that is now a new sustained kind of margin dynamic in Reservoir Characterization?
Olivier Le Peuch: So Kurt, I think the reason why we have such a margin decline is due to two factors. The first is the fact that we had a severe top-line decline of 20% sequentially. That's unusual but it was on the low side of what we -- on the high side, what we typically see seasonally. And I think there are decrementals associated with this.  Secondly, there were a few disruptions during the quarter that added to the cost that could not be recovered during the quarter. And third and maybe the most important one I think is that the decision by the operator to start to tighten purse in the later part of the quarter did impact, what is typically making the quarter -- in the first quarter which is the sales of multi-client license, license sale and also the discretionary software.  So the Q1 is typically a low quarter for margin in Reservoir Characterization, seasonal effect. But this was compounded by the severity of the curtailment of spend in the latter part in the last six weeks of the quarter that’s impacted what typically contributes positively to our Q1 quarter or any quarter which is the end of the quarter sales for software or for multi-client. So, we expect this to continue indeed, however, we expect the seasonal effect to recover somewhat, albeit the exploration budget will be lower by about 40% from last year, that's the estimate from our engagement with the customer.
Kurt Hallead: And then my follow up question would we then be on Cameron? And in that context, margins there were fairly strong. I think we can all expect that orders and FIDs and everything will wind up being pushed to the right. So I guess my question would be more along the lines of the projects that are in backlog. How should we think about the margin progression in Cameron as the rest of the year evolves?
Olivier Le Peuch: There was -- there are two factors that did influence, one positive and one negative in the quarter and one of them will continue. So the negative factor impacted the Cameron margin related to the short-cycle impacting North America declining more than we had anticipated and this decline will continue. We are taking action to maintain or to control the decremental on that aspect. And the second factor was favorable mix in the OneSubsea long-cycle business. So the mix of these will continue going forward. We expect this to be slightly declining in the second quarter, because we see more decline in North America as was clearly highlighted in this call. And the favorable mix of OneSubsea will not repeat in the same magnitude for the next quarter. However, we still feel that the long-term backlog we have in OneSubsea and to some extent in the new award we got in long-lead drilling will support sustaining the margin somehow in the long-term.
Operator: And next we’ll go to a question from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Good morning, Olivier. Two questions on the international front there. You highlighted spending being down 15% this year. It's obviously really complicated though, so many moving parts in there. And you don't have a ton of customer visibility, which I totally appreciate. But I was just wondering if you could just kind of talk about the different buckets that you're seeing out there. You've got offshore versus Middle East versus Latin America, everything is kind of moving at different rates. Could you just kind of give us thoughts generally on how you see all the different moving -- all the different parts moving? And then secondarily, if you could just kind of dig in on kind of Middle East, Russia and China, help us kind of collectively, how big is that part of your business? I'm not expecting you give me a percentage number, but just kind of just give us a sense because I would think that would be kind of the more stable part of your portfolio over the next 12 to 24 months?
Olivier Le Peuch: As you correctly said, Dave, I think there is a lot of moving parts. The rig projection that we’re using as a proxy for future activity, I think keep moving to the right or keep declining, okay? And we have seen that in the recent weeks. I think we stabilize during the second quarter due to the decision that some OPEC+ member will take, the outcome of their commitment will get clearer. But this being said, as we commented before, when I exclude Russia and China, which have a seasonal effect in the second quarter that is favorable, when I exclude that, the decline of rig activity is low to mid-teens, sequential decline of rig in short-term. The variability of that varies a lot. We said at the -- some of the West Africa, Europe and to a lesser extent, Gulf of Mexico are getting more impacted than we will get in some of the land Middle East activity or even China offshore or Australia, or Qatar offshore that will actually go up.  So there's a lot of moving parts, as you said. But generally speaking, there are pocket of resilience that are either linked to long-term gas oil development offshore and onshore. And some of it could be like in Guyana, some of it could be Qatar gas offshore, some of it can be Deepwater Australia or China offshore or could be land Russia. All of this is making a pocket of resilience that we're trying to benefit from where we either have strong or very strong market position such as in Russia and Qatar offshore, for example. And we'll explore it and leverage these in the second quarter, and some of it where we will be trying to position our performance to get the most out of the activity. So that's the mix going forward. So pockets up and down and that will keep evolving. So that’s the best I can share at this moment, Dave. 
David Anderson: I appreciate that. And maybe just a follow up question on your APS portfolio. The last time we went through all this, we had some issues that there is more oil price exposure than I think a lot of us realized. Can you just talk about -- I know that portfolio is a lot smaller today, but how much is tied to the oil price versus the fixed tariffs? And I know payments is kind of a question we have. And maybe you can also just comment on where Ecuador is right now. And when you think operations could resume there? Thanks.
Stephane Biguet: I will take that question, Dave. So on the oil price exposure, it's about half of our APS revenue is on fixed tariff on service fee, while the other half has some element of indexation to oil or the gas prices. On that latter part, the good portion is already at the contractual minimum even with the oil prices we had in the first quarter. So the lower oil prices will not make it worse. All-in-all when you take all of these into account, we are not talking about a significant direct impact on our earnings at the lower oil prices of today. So it's not a significant effect.  On your second question regarding Ecuador, I don't think it's really appropriate for me to speculate on what specific customers will do from a payment standpoint. However, our total receivable balance in Ecuador was below 500 million at the end of March. And we received the timely payments during the quarter. So we will be watching this very closely. But, so far, the quarter was in line. 
Operator: And our next question is from line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Good morning, Olivier. So I just wanted to ask real quickly about COVID-19 and obviously the impacts it's having today. But if we think longer term, how do you think that the COVID-19 will impact, how you operate over the medium to longer term? I guess kind of what I'm asking here is, do you expect maybe to accelerate any remote operating or automation initiatives or maybe think about how you -- your supply chain if you try to have it less concentrated or maybe a less reliant on China or anything like that. So just kind of structurally, do you see any changes over the medium to longer term as a result of what's happening for COVID-19?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, very good question, Chase. So let me first comment on the way, we did react and we did to act and support our operation, our customers during this period. So we actually put in place from mid-January a full crisis management team looking at all aspects. First, and foremost, looking at the way we're protecting the health of our people and managing the support to logistics, supply chain and manufacturing. And we did that for the last three months now, going to full-scale across all organization. And by doing that, we started to mitigate and understand the alternate path we have for logistics. We set up a second source and/or better understand the risk we were having toward some supply exposure, be it in China or elsewhere in the world. And actually we have no disruption. The disruption we had were related to shutdown, states or government mandated in Malaysia or in Italy that we cannot offset. But aside from this we're actually showing extremely good resilience on the logistics, on the movement of people, as we have a lot of people that are in every country, local and we don't -- we do not depend as much as some of our peers and/or some of the operator on to flying team or international commuter in most of the countries where we operate.  So we had extremely good resilience. We did not let our customer down in any rig mobilization or in any product delivery at this point. So I think our resilience from a multiplicity of channel we have used for the second sourcing and the resilience of diversity and edge we have on our supply and manufacturing, I think has been helping us. Now going forward, you are totally right, and I think we have accelerated our remote operation and automation of some of our operations. In the month of March we had more than 60% of our drilling operation that were using remote operation. So we have been exploiting with success the remote operation by reducing the footprint of people on the rig site having very positive impact on HSE, helping and supporting them remotely with an impact on service quality and providing efficiency and cost that benefit both the operator and ourselves.  So this will continue, will accelerate. We have an excellent platform internally and we have our DELFI platform externally, where our clients are starting to adopt drilling in particular remote operation and automation. This is accelerating as we speak.  Another example, Chase is, as we were deploying DELFI and you have now seen that into the earning press release for Woodside, we were getting the request to accelerate due to the COVID-19 restriction, accelerate the deployment of the cloud based infrastructure so that the asset team, the geoscientists of our customer could work from home and have the full access to their data and to their powerful geoscience application. We're able to deploy and accelerate and with great satisfaction and success and this has been -- used as an example going forward. So yes, it will be a differentiation that we’ll use going forward. 
Chase Mulvehill: One quick follow-up. Obviously globally we're starting to see some producing wells being shut in and obviously that’s probably going to accelerate over the next couple of month or two. But as we think about these wells that are shut in and as they come back online, could you talk to the impact -- the service activity impact or the revenue that could impact your business as these wells are having to be brought back online maybe in the back half of this year, kind of early in the next year? 
Olivier Le Peuch: It's difficult to say Chase. I think first, I think it's difficult to judge the magnitude of the number of shut-ins. It will depend how fast and how much there will be an excess of supply going into topping the storage tanks. So I think it depends on the reservoir. It depends on the location. But generally speaking, yes, I think every well at the shut-in, when it’s put back needs to get a bit of well management, scaling and stimulation activity. So that will favor the service activity at large whenever it comes back on the campaign of reservicing those wells and providing intervention and stimulation to make them back flowing at their maximum capacity. So that will indeed be a positive, if I may, effect as we exit this very difficult period and we start to recover the full capacity of the oil-producing fields.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of George O'Leary with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.
George O'Leary : Just wanted to start off on the offshore side. From an offshore perspective, shallow and deepwater rig count activity begins this downturn kind of at lower levels or well off prior cycle peak. So I wondered if you could provide any color on how we should think about Schlumberger's offshore exposure entering this downturn versus prior cycles whether as a percentage of revenue, just some kind of ballpark way to think about offshore exposure for you all?
Olivier Le Peuch : As you said, I think the -- we have not recovered far from it, the level of activity we have deepwater before the previous downturn. The deepwater, particularly in the floating -- floater market has been recovering maybe 10% to 20% from the trough, that's about it for the last three years. There was being -- there has been more rebounds, albeit not fully recovered on the shallow water market. So obviously it is big part of our international portfolio as this is key to the industry. How do I see it forward? I think I believe that the deepwater will decline as much as the shallow, albeit I think it will not decline to the magnitude that it had in the last downturn, there is not so much to give, and quite a few large projects that are active today that will continue to operate. So I see both shallow and deepwater declining in the months to come. And I think the indication and the number I shared before double-digit to mid-teens decline sequentially apply to both actually. And I think we will manage it, but I don't think that it will be the same magnitude far from it, particularly for the deepwater.
George O'Leary : And then secondarily, just aside from now having Cameron in the fold and you guys sold the marine seismic vessels businesses and there's been a lot of changes and you guys have been doing kind of Yeoman's work to structurally change the business and become more fixed cost CapEx light. But what notable way should we think about the Schlumberger portfolio being different, i.e., more resilient entering this downturn versus prior down cycles?
Olivier Le Peuch : I think a major part of it will come from our exposure in North America where we have made a decision to accelerate the new strategy, scale-to-fit, and also asset-light technology access. That's a major element of resilience in this downturn that will impact positively our way forward. And second, I would say is our digital strategy that I think we have invested into the last downturn to give us the benefit and certainly that will be leveraged with what has happened with remote operation automation. And the combination of executing our asset-light, particularly in North America and any, I would say, high volume basins, and some of it will be in the overseas and Middle East or in China or elsewhere where we will accelerate our technology access asset-light strategy and digital will complement this. So I believe that going forward we will gain better resilience from our exposure and support from digital and asset-light to technology access.
Operator: And next we have a question from Chris Voie with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Chris Voie : I wanted to ask about the international margin side. So if you look back to the last downturn, 2014 plus, margins, it looks like held in quite well in the first year after the decline in activity, but then there was a pretty meaningful decline in 2016 as that year reflected more the new work that was awarded at lower prices and also cost absorption. Going into this one, if we assume a similar setup where most of the work that still happens in 2020 has been already awarded, but in 2021 it would be new work, I think it's a little bit different. In that, there's less pricing to give, but potentially less cost available to cut as well. Could you maybe walk through how the margin profile going forward might compare this time around compared to last time?
Olivier Le Peuch : Yeah. It's difficult to comment until we -- as I said earlier, we get the better clarity on the second half of the exact mix of international adjustments as well as we get more clarity on when the COVID-19 crisis is getting an exit, a steady exit, so that it will give us a better indication on 2021 outlook. But this being said, and you pointed out yourself, I think there is much less pricing concession to concede in this cycle so that will we get a little bit of a different profile of margin compression going forward. I believe that we will be able to fare better in this cycle -- through cycle our margin compression that we have had in the previous one due to a lesser exposure to price decline for one; two, better efficiency including some element of digital in our ability to operate and flex our operating capacity with the activity. And I would say also possibly a better resilience in some of the markets that we mentioned before where we have a stronger position.
Chris Voie : And if I could get in a quick follow-up. In the release, you commented on how many fleets have been reduced in North America through the end of March. I'm wondering if you can give any color on how much further you might have cut at this point? And there's a lot of speculation that fleet count in North America might go extremely low. Just curious if you can give any color on what you're seeing just at the leading edge there?
Olivier Le Peuch : Yes. We are seeing the frac fleet going low, very low. But I think our trough, we anticipate will still be above 100 fleet we believe going forward. Now we will not recover from that going forward. We see some models arguing that the fleet count will go as low as 50 or 60 for the full market. We don't believe this will be the case, at least what we see and the indication we have. And we are aiming to maintain 10 to 15 or 10 to 12 fleet as a minimum operating into that environment and to have them active and deploying them to our fit strategy to the basin we favor and to the customer we believe are recognizing the performance we bring.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh : I'm wondering if you could help me reconcile, it seems like based on your sequential activity commentary and your full year commentary that you expect the vast majority of the activity reductions to occur in second quarter. Is that correct? And is that correct for both North America and international markets?
Olivier Le Peuch : Yes. I think at the current assumption with the visibility we have, I think there is a sharp decline. As I said, this quarter is the worst in terms of decline rate that the industry I think possibly would have ever seen in North America clearly and internationally possibly. There will be further adjustments in the second half of the year in some markets, international markets as well as maybe final rounding in North America. But I believe that the most decline is happening this quarter and will stabilize over the summer. So yes, I think the indication we gave I think are certainly helping us to be with lesser decline and more stable environment from the exit rate of Q2 into the second half at this point.
Connor Lynagh : Okay. That's fair. And in that context, it certainly seems like you guys have been proactive on cost management thus far. But relative to historical decrementals, should we think about second quarter being a bit higher relative to usual, just given all that's going on and maybe mitigating from there or how would you think about the path?
Olivier Le Peuch : I think commenting on -- as I said earlier, giving you guidance on the second quarter from the top-line first is difficult because international markets has a level of disruption, 3% to 5% possible on the rig disruption due to restriction for the COVID-19 combined with some decision on the -- of change of tack with some national company that will have to adapt the new OPEC+ voluntary cuts, it is making the top-line very difficult to predict in the second quarter. And when it comes to the bottom-line, I think the abruptness of the adjustment can be and will be coped with to some extent North America, but the lag into the ability to reduce the cost internationally is not the same due to many factors. Hence, the decremental in the next quarter will certainly be -- not be as good as we have historically done in a downturn. Now through the cycle, I think our ambition is to fare better for the reason I mentioned before. But in the second quarter, I think it will be a messy quarter at large from a activity prediction and our ability to adjust our cost structure or to react and to leverage the opportunity we have also to uplift and get the most when there is an opportunity to upside and there will be upside.
Olivier Le Peuch : Thank you. So I believe with this, I think we need to close. So let me conclude by reiterating some key take away from this call. Firstly, I believe that the company performed well during the first quarter despite a very challenging environment with excellent resilience and performance across operations, particularly in international market and a very respectable financial results, particularly in the cash flow from operation. I feel very proud of the Schlumberger team who have delivered this under such stressful conditions. Secondly, as we were presented with growing uncertainty on global economic outlook and a fast deteriorating commodity price, we acted swiftly, reducing our capital spend program significantly, accelerating our scale-to-fit strategy approach in North America and taking exceptional measure to protect our cash and liquidity for the second quarter and beyond. Thirdly, and after in-depth review of forward-looking scenarios, we decided to adjust the dividend to a new level, as a prudent capital management decision, providing us with the liquidity and financial flexibility we need considering the significant uncertainty in the quarter to come. Finally, as we navigate this unprecedented industry downturn, we continue to prioritize key element of our strategy, namely the capital stewardship initiative to protect the company's financial strength, the fit-for-basin strategy to increase the performance impact in key basins for our customers and create sustainable differentiation. And finally, the acceleration of the industry’s digital transformation to support higher efficiency, efficiency gains in operation for our customers and for our own success. May everyone stay safe and healthy. Thank you for your attention.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.  Schlumberger-Private

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-17 09:00:00) =====
Presentation:  
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Simon Farrant, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held here this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Stephane Biguet, VP Finance. For today's agenda, Olivier will start the call with his perspectives on the quarter and our updated review of the industry macro, after which, Simon Ayat will give more detail on our financial results. Then we will open up to your questions. As always, before we begin, I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. Now I’ll hand the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to comment on 4 topics this morning: first, our fourth quarter performance and our expectations for the first quarter; second, our view of the industry macro conditions; third, the 2020 outlook and our goals for the year; and last, an update on our strategy for North America. Before that, however, I would like to say how proud I am of the Schlumberger team's performance throughout 2019. The progress we made in operational execution in a challenging year has been outstanding. During the last 6 months, we set new benchmarks for safety and much improved our service quality performance. Execution matters greatly to our customers and is the foundation of our performance vision. I feel privileged to lead such a high-performing team. Last quarter performance highlighted the value of our international franchise, where activity was very encouraging. For the first time since 2014, international margins improved sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter. This led to 100 bps margins expansion from H1 to H2 2019. Several factors drove our international financial performance: Year-end product sales reached one of the highest level since 2014. We made early progress in reversing underperforming business units across several GeoMarkets. Finally, we saw a favorable technology mix on offshore exploration and digital, benefiting Reservoir Characterization at large and Wireline and Software Integrated Solutions (SIS), in particular, both of which had one of their best quarter since 2014. In North America, our team managed proactively the sharp decline in land activity and pricing headwinds during the quarter while concurrently launching and starting to execute our North America land strategy. I will elaborate on this in a moment. Fourth quarter free cash flow was also very strong, building on resilient cash flow from operations and further progress in the company's working capital efficiency. This, combined with the proceeds from 2 business transactions, enabled us to reduce net debt by $1.3 billion during the quarter. Overall, the fourth quarter was very solid internationally with expanded margins and resilience in North America despite the severe drop in activity and weaker pricing. Taken together, these resulted into year-over-year growth in both EPS and cash flow generation. As we transition to the first quarter, most business lines and geographies will experience the usual seasonal decline. However, following strong year-end sales and the limited impact of winter disruptions during the fourth quarter, we anticipate the International and Cameron business to record high single-digit sequential decline in revenue, a seasonal impact marginally higher than in recent years. Also, we anticipate a low single-digit sequential declines in North America, primarily related to the execution of our NAL strategy and the seasonal offshore impact. In addition, the recent and persistent market disruption linked to geopolitical risk or civil unrest continue to affect our international operations and represent a financial exposure during the first quarter. In particular, our activity in Iraq have been visibly reduced due to security risks, similar to our reduced activity in Libya. Also, Argentina activity remains muted due to the difficult investment climate. Looking now at the macro. The recent easing of the U.S.-China trade conflict has reduced uncertainty on the economic outlook and the latest IEA forecast for oil demand indicates growth of 1.2 million BPD in 2020, slightly higher than in 2019. U.S. production growth, however, should slow significantly in 2020, and come well short of last year's growth due to heightened capital discipline and resulting drop in activity. Over time, this will create a pull on the OPEC+ and international non-OPEC production base. These macro conditions will continue to support the international growth cycle. They will also increasingly stimulate the investment to renew activity in offshore and deepwater exploration and development as the year progress. Moving now to the outlook for 2020. We anticipate international E&P CapEx spending to grow in the mid-single-digit range. In contrast, we expect the second year of market contraction in the North America land with a decline in the high single-digit to double-digit range. This aligns with the strength of our International franchise and makes the execution of our NAL strategy even more critical to protecting our returns from any further activity downside. With this market outlook, our ambition will be to grow internationally above mid-single digit excluding the impact of recent divestiture, revert Cameron group to growth on the back of long-cycle booking execution and contain North America to high single-digit decline as a consequence of both market conditions and strategy execution. Within this market, the impact of our capital stewardship strategy, particularly the reduction of underperforming business units, will be material. At the same time, the impact of our transformation program should continue to enhance incremental margin performance and cash flow for most of the service product lines. We are confident that the shape and mix of international activity growth will support favorable revenue quality during the next 4 quarters with contributions from new technology adoptions, stronger offshore activity and digital transformation. Offshore activity will increasingly grow towards deepwater basins in later part of 2020, reflecting the acceleration in investment by IOCs and large independents. Therefore, we expect international margins to further expand in 2020, building on the momentum from second half of 2019. In addition, and as an outcome of the NAL strategy execution, we also expect North America margins to expand, despite the headwinds on activity and revenue contraction. This will be the first year since 2014 with such an improvement in financial performance across international and North America markets. This aligns closely with our strategy focus on returns both in margin and cash generation. I now have some comments on the NAL strategy content and execution to support our margin expansion in North America despite the expected double-digit market contraction in 2020. In September, part of our new performance strategy introduction included a specific scale-to-fit and technology access approach to restore North America to double-digit margins by prioritizing returns over growth. For the most part, we have completed a review of our current business portfolio performance. We have mapped the outlook scenario and the anticipated market trends and documented all available options, both organic and inorganic, to achieve a step change in returns and an asset-light portfolio transformation. Although this is still ongoing, we are ready to share key aspects of this strategy today. First, and to address OneStim, the largest element of our North America portfolio. We have decided to repurpose the business across 3 hubs to decentralize the support structure around the largest basins. This will further align our organization and capability with our key customers and maximize the positive impact of technology and integration. This has resulted into a net reduction of 30% of deployed frac fleet capacity and impacted visibly our fourth quarter sequential decline. This will represent a new self-imposed capacity cap compared to the levels of the third quarter of 2019 or a 50% reduction when compared to our total available capacity. The greater alignment with key customers and major basins will also increase the number of dedicated frac fleets to more than 80% of the total, leading to much reduced spot market exposure. While we believe these actions improve OneStim performance, reshaping it for the better into a focused and profitable business line, we will keep our options open and be ready to participate into an enhanced market consolidation offering, given the right partner and economics. Second, we will cease onshore coil tubing operations in North America. A market, we believe, is commoditized and offers neither significant integration nor performance technology upside. Third, we are pursuing opportunities for the future of our rod lift business line in North America. We believe that this portfolio is best served through regional players that can further leverage the distribution network and better align with the equipment market. We will continue to develop the business, support our people and serve our customers until we find the right opportunity. Finally, we will continue to accelerate our fit-for-basin strategy where we selectively franchise our technology access through a network of local, basin-specific partners. This was demonstrated with success by Drilling & Measurements in 2019. We will expand this asset model -- asset-light model to other business line to increase our market reach, while optimizing our infrastructure and CapEx requirements. In support of these decisions, we will continue to rationalize our facility footprint with an estimated 25% reduction in operating locations before the end of 2020 and adjust the support structure accordingly. We have already reduced our workforce by more than 1,400 employees since Q3 2019. The action related to the strategy execution, when completed, will generate savings in excess of $300 million on an annualized basis when compared to the Q3 2019 run rate. Our ambition for North America land in 2020 has been clearly set for margin expansion despite the unfavorable activity outlook. While our strategic decision will result in revenue reduction greater than the decline in the market, they will contribute incremental earnings and cash flow compared to 2019. This will allow further prioritization of resources and CapEx allocation toward the international market. I hope that my comments this morning offered you more color on our fourth quarter performance as well as fresh guidance for our first quarter and full year ambition, while also providing you with insights on our strategy for North America land. Now before I hand over to Simon Ayat, I would like to recognize the contribution he has made over more than 37 years of his career with Schlumberger and more than 13 years leading the finance function of this company. Simon steps down next week but will continue as a senior strategic adviser to me. I'm also very pleased to welcome Stephane Biguet to the CFO role. I fully trust his experience and functional expertise. With this, I'll turn it over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Olivier. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.39. This represents a decrease of $0.04 sequentially but an increase of $0.03 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $209 million of net pretax charges. This reflected $456 million of restructuring charges, offset by a $247 million gain on the formation of the Sensia joint venture. The restructuring charges largely relate to our North America operation. They consist primarily of write-offs relating to facility closures and exiting certain activities as well as severance. These restructuring charges and related write-offs were all recorded at the end of the quarter. Therefore, the fourth quarter results do not include any significant benefit as a result of this charge. Our fourth quarter revenue of $8.2 billion decreased 4% sequentially, as the 2% growth in our international operations was more than offset by a 14% decline in North America. Pretax segment operating margins decreased by 60 basis points to 12.2%. Highlights by product group were as follows: Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion was essentially flat sequentially, while margin increased 59 basis points to 22.4%. The margin increase was primarily driven by higher SIS software sales. Drilling revenue of $2.4 billion was also essentially flat as lower revenue in Russia and North America land was offset by increased drilling activity in the Middle East. Margins were flat at 12.4%. Production revenue of $2.9 billion decreased 9% sequentially, driven by a 33% (sic) [33% decline] in OneStim revenue in North America land due to lower demand and pricing pressure. This decrease was partially offset by strong international Completions activity. Margins of 8.8% only decreased slightly by 32 basis points primarily due to the effects of the lower OneStim activity, partially offset by improved international margins from higher activity. Cameron revenue of $1.4 billion increased 2% sequentially as OneSubsea, Surface Systems and Drilling Systems each grew. These increases were partially offset by the effects of the divestiture of the Measurements business in connection with the Sensia transaction. Margins decreased 359 basis points to 9.1% primarily as a result of lower-margins on OneSubsea projects and the impact of North America on the short-cycle activity. The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle business was 1.5 in Q4. The OneSubsea backlog increased to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the fourth quarter, which was consistent with the previous quarter. I was very pleased with our cash flow in the fourth quarter, as we generated $2.3 billion of cash from operations. This brings the total year of 2019 to $5.4 billion from operations and $2.7 billion of free cash flow. In addition, during the quarter, we received approximately $590 million of net proceeds as a result of the closings of the Sensia joint venture and the Drilling Tools divestiture. Our net (sic) [net debt] improved by $1.3 billion during the quarter to $13.1 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $2.2 billion. Over the course of the fourth quarter, we repurchased an additional $1.1 billion of outstanding notes, the vast majority of which were due to mature over the next 2 years. These repurchases, combined with the actions we took last quarter, will serve to reduce our interest expense going forward while at the same time improving our debt maturity towers. During the quarter, we spent $494 million on CapEx and $255 million of capitalized costs relating to Asset Performance Solutions (APS) projects, formerly known as SPM. We also made $692 million of dividend payments. We did not buy back any stock during the quarter. Full year 2020 Capex, excluding APS and multiclient investments, is expected to be flat with 2019. Before I turn over the call to the operator for the Q&A, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank you, our shareholders and analysts. I know we've been through tough times due to industry conditions and, overall, it has been a very productive relationship. I ask you to please welcome Stephane as the new CFO, and extend him the same courtesy. As a departing statement, please remember: cash is king. And now back to operator.
Operator: And our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning James.
James West: Maybe first for Simon Ayat. Thanks for your many years of help, guidance, and certainly, wisdom. And you will be missed.
Simon Ayat: Thank you James. Thank you very much.
James West: So Olivier, as we think about the second half of 2020, you talked about revenue quality improving clearly with international and offshore. That's a much better mix of business for Schlumberger for the industry and in general. Could you maybe expand a bit on that and what it could mean for both your revenue growth, but also continued margin improvement in your business?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, thank you, James. So I think back to what I shared during my prepared remark. We foresee that the year-on-year growth internationally will be in line and slightly better than the current mid-single digits when we exclude the effect and impact of the divestiture we had. That has an impact of about 2% internationally. I also reiterate the fact that I foresee that the second half will be more robust than the first half on the back of offshore, both the offshore deepwater particularly, where we see in the projection engagement we have with our customer, significant upside in the later part of the year due to exploration as well as development. So the impact of this, we expect will result into not only 5% or better growth for the year, but also margin expansion in excess of 100 bps for the full year internationally.
James West: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, if we think about the full year, and I know you guys don't give full year guidance, but it seems to me that we've got a bit of a hockey stick going into the back half. And so as we think about where the -- I guess where expectations are, both your internal expectations, our expectations, et cetera, do we think that you could -- that the second half shrink makes up for what will be a little bit of a weaker than potentially expected first quarter?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, the first quarter, indeed. And you have heard my prepared remark highlighting the high single-digit sequential decline for International and Cameron, the low single-digit decline in North America. All of these will combine due to the seasonal effect, the transition from a good revenue mix in Q4 into Q1 into high decrementals into Q1. So that is our expectation. However, I think from the -- we'll not wait the second half. I think from the second quarter, we expect the mix to improve, the execution of our NAL strategy to start to bear fruit and the international outlook to go back to normal seasonality, so the combination of which should provide the support for growth of earnings from -- sequentially from Q2 onwards.
James West: Okay, very helpful. Thanks Olivier.
Operator: And next, we go to Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Thank you, good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning Sean.
Sean Meakim: I'd like to maybe just continue a bit more on the framework for 2020, maybe just expand on some of those thoughts. So we're looking for margin expansion across both North America and international. Can we unpack a little bit of what's building your confidence that we're making the turn here on margins? Given the emphasis on the back half of 2020, how much would you say is confidence in what's happening in the market from more a macro perspective versus the impact of your self-help initiatives?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think, to give you more light on this, Sean, I think I would like to contrast North America and international. I believe the international market is poised for further growth. And I think we've come out on a mid-single digit, is poised for further offshore and mix, including later part the deepwater, both of which combine to present the good, favorable mix that will help us execute. So internationally, I believe that the combination of our self-help, through capital stewardship program on underperforming business units, continuation of our transformation program that has had positive impact onto the service business line incrementals, and the effect of our technology adoption on those favorable offshore market as well as international digital transformation, will all combine to this 100 bps-plus expansion in international. So we have some confidence there. Obviously, all depends on the top line and activity growth, but we have confidence in this shape and into the favorable revenue mix. By contrast, North America will depend on our execution of our NAL strategy. There is a downside risk as similar to last year. There is some uncertainty on to the market spend and on to the pricing headwinds that could affect and delay some of the benefits that we'll collect from the NAL strategy. But all in all, both for different reasons, more self-help and NAL execution strategy in North America and market conditions as well as continuation of our progress internationally will combine to shape up our margins next year.
Sean Meakim: Understood. That's very helpful. Maybe just to continue on North America. A couple of clarifications and just maybe to go a little bit deeper. It sounds like you said half of your horsepower is going away. Is that being stacked with the potential to come back? Or are we scrapping that horsepower? And maybe just if we could clarify the difference there. And maybe just -- I hoping to talk about the rest of the product and service lines. Are there potential for other divestitures or other transformative type of transactions that you're considering? Maybe just hear about the rest of the portfolio in North America as well.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think you have heard the comment we made and I made in my prepared remarks. We have decided to cut our deployed capacity by 30% when contrasted with the fourth quarter of 2019. And we will self impose this as a cap going forward. That results into about 50% of our capacity that we don't intend to deploy. And I think whether it's cold-stacked or unemployed, it will not be deployed going forward as we are repurposing our -- and restructuring our business around 3 basins or on 3 large hubs to serve the most active basins. And as such, we will not expect to increase our capacity. Beyond this, you have heard the choice we made to exit coiled tubing onshore, to evaluate divestiture of rod lift, and to further accelerate our technology access fit-for-basin strategy to replicate the success of D&M. All of this combined will result into a top line decrease faster than the market due to the self-imposed cap on capacity and as well as the exit of some business units, but also will result into high grading our portfolio margins as well as benefiting from the success on technology access business model, asset-light model to replicate D&M and expand. And that is what we expect to see.
Sean Meakim: Thank you for clarifying, I appreciate that.
Operator: Next we go to Scott Gruber. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning Scott.
Scott Gruber: Just staying on the NAL outlook for North America. You provided the market outlook and commented that there will also be an impact from scaling down and exiting some businesses. Any potential additional color that you can provide on a range of additional impact from the strategic shift on the top line in North America in 2020 relative to the market?
Olivier Le Peuch: Globally speaking, I think we gave the guidance that North America land will see -- will see a market contraction of high single digit to low double digits. On the back of what we are executing, we believe, if everything is executed, that will be in the mid-teens to high teens -- in the mid-teens decline from the same scope in North America land, in the same scope, okay? So that's the guidance I can share with you, okay? This extra contraction that we anticipate will be a few percentage points of further decline compared to what we see in the market.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And obviously, you're exiting the more capital-intensive business lines that oftentimes tend to be more CapEx-intensive. Can you just talk about the cash dynamics in the business as you go forward in 2020? Are you near neutral on the net cash you think you're going to be able to generate in the business in light of the restructuring, just given the cash consumption from some of these product lines? Is there a hit? And if you could just provide some color on that front as well?
Simon Ayat: Sorry, Scott, is your question about North America or in total?
Scott Gruber: Yes. Well, in North America, how -- is OneStim, for instance, cash generative today such that you lose cash with the scale down? Or is it consuming cash today such that you'd actually save on cash given the scale down?
Simon Ayat: No, we -- okay, Simon here again. We are expecting to be better than neutral on OneStim. And actually, it's not true that OneStim consumed cash. OneStim is -- we've been managing it to be neutral, but will be better than neutral going forward.
Scott Gruber: So the restructuring helps the cash profile of OneStim?
Simon Ayat: Absolutely, yes.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Important clarification. Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Simon, I echo James' comments, and I wish you the very best in the next chapter of your career. And Olivier, we appreciate the details very much on your call. This is great to have the granularity that you provided today, so this is very helpful. So I would add on the -- or the North America commentary, if you think through 2020, comment a little bit on international margins, thought around North America margins under the scale-to-fit strategy and how we should think about margins over the course of 2020 as you see lower revenue growth, but obviously, a margin impact. And how we can think about EBITDA in that context?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think, Angie. So yes, to reiterate what I shared before, I think the margin progression in North America will result from 2 critical action: One is the high grading of our portfolio through either capacity restriction, exiting some underperforming business unit or basin location, as well as exiting or divesting some part of our business as well that were not accretive to our margin or to our cash flow. And secondly, combined with accelerating what we call fit-for-basin, what we call technology access. That is an asset-light model aiming at franchising some of our technology to local players, regional players, basin players, and complementing our service access, service business model with an extended market reach with technology sets. So this has proven to be effective, satisfying our customers and expanding our market last year with accretive impact onto the margins of our segments. So we will continue to accelerate this. So the combination of these 2, what we expect to see impacting margins in North America.
Angie Sedita: Okay. So -- and then further around North America and OneStim, do you view OneStim as core to your operations? Do you think that you need to be in OneStim longer term? And what other options for either rightsizing the business or strategic partners do you see for that business overall in North America for 2020 and beyond?
Olivier Le Peuch: As we have said before, we believe it's critical that we fully participate into the North America market first. It's a market that is here to stay. It's a market that will, over time, come back to use and align with our reservoir technology and capability. However, we believe that we will continue to evaluate alternate ways to participate into this market. For now, we have decided that we rightsize, we scale to fit and we refocus our OneStim operation to be fit, lean, and more profitable. But we'll continue to observe the market opportunity. As we have said, all options are on the table. And when and if an opportunity arise with the right partner and the right economics, we will take the step and look at alternate way to keep participating into the market and yet exit this.
Angie Sedita: Great, thanks. I’ll turn it over.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Angie, for your comments. Simon here.
Operator: Next we’ll go to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: So Olivier, you talked about your strategy of an asset-light, more technology-driven businesses in North America. It seemed to fit pretty well with digital being a primary growth driver, as you talked about. You made a number of agreements around DELFI late last year. I was just wondering if you could just talk about how you see the progression of revenue over the next several years. I guess, that will mostly be in the Reservoir Characterization business. Is it fair to assume that maybe the top line comes down a little bit initially as you move more towards the subscription-based models? And you talked about maybe this business doubling, but I'm just kind of wondering if you could just kind of give us maybe a little bit of a road map of kind of what this looks like over the next few years?
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Dave. I'm not sure I will give you a detailed road map today, no. But I will comment on some of the remarks. So indeed, we have stated, and I believe we are still setting and having a clear ambition to double the digital revenue in the next few years. We do not anticipate that the transition to software as a service will materially or will actually negatively impact our revenue trajectory. We have had a pause somehow in our digital in the last couple of years, revenue growth, more due to the market condition as well as the fact that our DELFI offering was not having the readiness and the breadth to expand into the marketplace. So this has been addressed. I think the SIS Forum that did happen in September gave us the opportunity to not only commercialize 4 new DELFI products, but also create a step change and a new momentum in the industry with our open strategy. So a combination of this DELFI new product and the open strategy has carried the momentum that has attracted the engagement with customer, and we have seen one of the engagement that has materialized with Exxon for drilling digital products in North America. So you will see our digital opportunity to be communicated in the coming weeks and months, both internationally and in North America, and both in workflow or product deployment or in edge operation. So we are working hard on several fronts with several customers, and we're making progress. And I think the leadership we have established is recognized across the industry, is valued and will only accelerate going forward.
David Anderson: If you don't mind, I'd like to switch gears. If I could just kind of talk about the Middle East for a moment here. You had a very good quarter by all accounts in your commentary on the progress in the Middle East. But it kind of comes with a bit of caution on your first half, the remarks about the OPEC agreement. I was just kind of curious on 2 fronts here: Isn't much of your business natural gas-driven so -- or maybe your mix is a little bit different. But I would have thought the natural gas side would have held up. And then secondarily, if you could just comment on the status of the LSTK contracts. I know it's been a big focus of yours to try to get those fixed. If you could maybe just give us a little insight of the progress there.
Olivier Le Peuch: First, to answer your question on the Middle East market and gas, the Middle East market, I think, is still very steady, and I think it's poised for further growth. However, based on the -- on some of the cap of OPEC+ requirements, on occasions, we see some of the developments that have been started to be either paused or delayed in the context of caps. Now the gas is indeed very active. Gas development project are very active, particularly offshore in the Middle East, and this is not slowing down. This is actually accelerating, and we fully participate into this.  Coming into the LSTK. Indeed, the LSTK has been under scrutiny, be it in Middle East or across the world. And I'm happy to report that we have made a steady progress to stabilize and improve the operational performance and also to address on occasion, specifically with some customers, be it Middle East or elsewhere, the specific contractual terms and liability that we believe were not appropriate for -- when contrasted with risk or the engagement we had. So we have made progress on those. I'm pleased to report that every time I go to Saudi, in particular, I'm getting increasingly positive feedback from the customer. And I'm pleased with the steady progress with my team.
David Anderson: Good to hear, thank you.
Operator: And next, we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Morning Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: I echo everyone’s comments on Simon. And Simon, I look forward to frequenting your restaurants.
Simon Ayat: Thank you very much, Kurt. You are welcome.
Kurt Hallead: Olivier, thank you so much for all the great color this morning with respect to the outlook on the macro and the specifics. And I think the one area that I was looking for a little bit more color on myself related to the margin dynamics in North America and the magnitude of the potential margin improvement on a year-on-year basis. And I kind of ask this in the context of, as you know, you don't report margins on a geographic basis. You report them on a segment basis. So really just trying to get some sense on how to think about the North American margin improvement on a year-on-year basis.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think I can reiterate some of the comment I made. I think the level of margin improvement will be 2 level. I'm not talking about pricing. That is a headwind that I think we have estimated to be 2% or 3%, particularly focused on the pressure pumping, excluding negative expansion there. We believe that the 2 levels will be the high grading of our portfolio to capacity cap and/or to exit and the change of business model to technology access. So the impact of those 2 set of actions will, we believe, shall accelerate and expand our margin by more than 100 bps in North America on the way to our double-digit returns that we have set in our strategy, the pace of which, I think, could be accelerated if the market conditions are favorable. Could be a little bit seeing headwinds if the pricing get too deteriorated. But we are confident that we will have triple-digit basis points improvement in North America at large.
Kurt Hallead: That's really helpful. And then just to follow up on the on the SPM monetizations. Can you give us some color on how things might be progressing? And how you might see the opportunity to monetize some of those assets in 2020?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, I think the process of asset divestiture for the Bandurria Sur in Argentina actually is progressing very well. So we are in the advanced stage of the divestiture there and with closing anticipated during the first quarter of 2020, after all standard closing conditions are met. That's the situation and the progress we have.
Kurt Hallead: Great, thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.
Byron Pope: Just have one question on capital allocation. Now that you're evaluating all of your investments through a return on capital versus growth lens, I would -- and thinking about the 2020 guidance as CapEx is flattish year-over-year, I would think that North America would be down directionally. So it sort of implies that you've got some attractive opportunities to allocate capital internationally and offshore in 2020. So I was not asking for specific color, but just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more of a sense for the investment opportunities that you guys have, both internationally, onshore as well as globally offshore in 2020.
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, indeed, I think we’ll comment on that. Why don’t you comment on this, Stephane?
Stephane Biguet: Sure, sure. So as you said, our 2020 CapEx, when you exclude multiclient and our APS investment will be more or less in line with what we spent in '19. So it's $1.7 billion. What will be different, however, is how we will allocate this across our different businesses as we apply our new capital stewardship process. So to illustrate this, the CapEx that will go to our international businesses will increase in 2020 to 85% of the total spend. As a reference, this percentage was just above 55% 2 years ago, so it's a significant switch. And also, we will redirect a large portion of that international CapEx to business units that are accretive to our overall margins, and we'll have a specific focus on new technology that generate premium pricing.
Byron Pope: Very helpful, thank you. I’ll turn it back.
Operator: Next we go to Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchi: Hey, thank you. Following up on the CapEx question and as it relates to APS, what should we be anticipating for CapEx in 2020 for APS? And could you talk about how that would be with or without the Argentina divestiture?
Stephane Biguet: So I think I'll take that question as well. Stephane here. But just before we discuss 2020, I just want to quickly take us back to '19. Our total investment for APS was $780 million, and this was already down $200 million compared to 2018. We said in the past that we'll be managing our APS portfolio on a cash flow positive basis, and cash flow is really the focus. We modulate the level of investment accordingly. And I can confirm that with this $780 million CapEx in '19, we did generate quite a bit of positive free cash flow, clearly, even a bit above our initial expectations. So now when you get into 2020, we have finalized our plans for each of our APS projects, and I can say that the free cash flow from APS will increase beyond 2019 significantly, actually. So the corresponding level of investment will clearly be lower than in '19, particularly on the back of the Argentina divestiture. But we will maintain the level of investment that's necessary to generate that positive cash flow.
Simon Ayat: I want to add a little bit more on the cash. I know the question is around the APS investments, but I wanted to highlight the strengths that we have seen in '19, that it will continue in 2020 on cash generation. As I said in my prepared remark, the total free cash flow reached $2.7 billion. And when you look at our commitment on the return of capital, be it dividend or the buyback that will continue, it's more or less met by our generation of free cash flow. In addition to this, when you look at the investment -- the divestment that we made, the proceeds that came from the 2 transaction, we were able to reduce the debt, and we ended up with $13.1 billion. So going forward, this will continue to be a focus. And I took over to mention this fact because there was a lot of questions in the past on our meeting the dividend cash flow requirement. And as you see in '19, we were able to mitigate the situation and to get to a point where we are within just tens of millions of dollars.
Marc Bianchi: Right. My follow-up is unrelated, on lift. Olivier, you mentioned potentially some changes with the rod lift strategy in North America. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about the outlook there. Is it something that's just specific to the rod lift business and the capital intensity? Or are you seeing some sort of a structural shift in demand?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, I think this is very specific to the capital-intensive of the rod lift-specific business, where we believe our strength as an organization, our technology focus as an organization is not necessarily best aligned with the support of this business. And we believe that there are partners that could and will certainly, with a focused approach, being better placed to execute this rod lift business in North America. So that's very similar to what we considered in the past for Drilling Tools, where we reached a decision to divest. Here, we are evaluating that decision.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Simon, can you talk about your free cash flow margin? Do we attain the double-digit margin in 2020? And then secondly, can you also comment on expected working capital performance for the first half of this year? Last year, that was a challenge. You consume a lot of cash in Q1 and then Q2 as well. I'm just curious as to what your expectations are for working capital in the first half of this year.
Simon Ayat: Sure, Bill. I'm going to cover a bit about '19 and give you an indication going forward. But Stephane will also free to comment on 2020 onward. As far as our profile is concerned, and you know this, the first half of the year, we consume a bit of liquidity in the working capital. First quarter normally, there is a consumption because of compensation-related payments on year-end bonuses that comes during the first quarter. And as you saw in '19, during the second half, we improved this working capital, and we produced the free cash flow required. 2020 will be similar profile. In the first quarter, we're going to consume cash in the working capital. But as we have declared, we are improving our free cash flow generation. And the -- our expectation in 2020 will be 2019 or even better. So this is where we are. The road towards the double digit is well defined. And I think implementation of the strategy will get us over there.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And then -- and with regard to the actual free cash flow margin expectation for 2020, it doesn't sound like you're going to hit double digits for the year, but you think that the margin will be improved. Because I think you were already at 8% for 2019, if the math is right?
Simon Ayat: Your math is correct. I mean, the double digit is an objective. And probably in 2020, we will not be reaching there.
Bill Herbert: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: I wanted to ask about Cameron and OneSubsea, in particular. Obviously, some very good orders in the quarter here, but there was a comment around some of the project margins coming in a little lower. Is that a onetime dynamic in the fourth quarter? Is that sort of symptomatic of what margins look like on a go-forward basis? Just wondering if you could address that.
Olivier Le Peuch: Let me comment on this. So I think we have -- the OneSubsea, indeed, I think, has been very successful in the fourth quarter to raise their booking with success, particularly on the back of this Ormen Lange large integrated project for subsea -- subsea processing. And I think they are still the leader there and will keep this leadership going forward. So I'm very, very confident and very happy and very pleased with the performance on OneSubsea. Now looking at the margin of Cameron, I think, this is due to 2 factors: Indeed, the long-cycle margin have been for a while—and I think we have been very clear on this—under margin compression. The backlog that both OneSubsea and Drilling, to a lesser extent, have booked in the last couple of years have been at reduced margin due to the market condition and pricing condition that have deteriorated. This has been offset partially or fully in the last 2 years by short-cycle business that did benefit from the growth in NAL until last year and did offset and kept the margin very healthy. Now the combination of low North America activity, pricing headwinds for the long -- the short cycle, combined with this backlog, have created a condition of the margin we are seeing. This is not here to stay. It will take a couple of quarters to recover, but I do expect the margin of Cameron over time and certainly, in 2020 to recover and to grow compared to '19 and go back to '18.
Connor Lynagh: That makes sense. Just in terms of the North America realignment, is there a significant impact we should think about on cost savings or scaling down in Cameron? Or is that largely related to traditional oilfield services?
Olivier Le Peuch: It's largely related to traditional oilfield services. I think as I commented before, the Cameron performance have been strong until recent time. I think last quarter was a bit of a challenge due to the severe trough. Now for some of our short cycle, we will still continue to adjust and make sure that we are structured to be aligned with the market condition, both pricing and with the size of the market. And we will continue to expand our Cameron franchise internationally as we have been successful. So I would expect that the short-cycle will be adjusted structurally to reflect the market condition. And we will divert and increase our focus on international as we have done in the last couple of years.
Connor Lynagh: Got it. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our last question will come from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Sorry. So I want to come back to the pressure pumping and the amount of capacity that you've actually reduced. So if I do the math correctly, it sounds like that you stacked about 600,000 horsepower in 2019 and maybe you entered the year 2019 with about 700,000 horsepower cold stacked, if I've done my math right. So how should we think about how much of that could come back and the cost that it would take to bring that capacity back into the market?
Olivier Le Peuch: Chase, our intention here is not to cold stack or warm stack and bring back. Our intention here is to rightsize the capacity, which we did; restructure the organization, which we are doing; and refocus on where we believe we have the best alignment with our customers, we have the best leverage for technology, reservoir technology, or surface efficiency technology differentiation, and we can bring the most benefit to our customers and to the market. We have done this, and we don't intend to bring back capacity going forward.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. All right. That makes sense. That clears some things up. I'll be getting a lot of questions about that. Coming over to the international side. You guys are focused on margins. It seems like a lot of your peers are focused on margin improvement on the international side. So maybe could you talk about pricing on international. Given that everybody's focused on margins, are you seeing more discipline on pricing? Are you able to push pricing, in particular, in the Middle East at this point yet?
Olivier Le Peuch: Similar to comment we made last quarter, I think there is still a dynamic where on large integrated contracts and high-volume contracts, we still see, be it in Middle East or elsewhere internationally, we still see negative pricing pressure or downward pricing pressure. Where by contrast, in more remote location and more specific exploration offshore or difficult project execution, we see and we have seen and we have had the opportunity to negotiate better price. And we see better also discipline from -- in the market on both -- on all the service providers. So I will say the market is still contrasted with large integrated contracts and discrete offshore exploration or remote location, and we believe this trend will continue in 2020. So I believe that considering the time, I think we'll have to conclude this call. So ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight my key message to conclude this call. First, the solid results of the fourth quarter and full year have highlighted the significant progress we have made in our international franchise and the early steps we took in execution of our North America land strategy. The momentum across our organization and the feedback from our customers continue to be very positive and support well our ambition for 2020. Our view for 2020 remains positive on the international market, which will be loaded on the back end of the year, particularly in deepwater activity. Internationally, we will benefit from further improvement in activity mix and revenue quality, which, when combined with our capital stewardship and performance program, will drive further margin expansion as a continuity of progress made in second half of 2019. In contrast, we face another year of declining North American market condition, but will accelerate our NAL strategy to fast-track our commitment to restore double-digit margins. Our actions, including scale-to-fit capacity reduction, rationalization towards asset-light through technology access and anticipated business unit exits will combine to reverse margin decline and with the ambition to grow both earnings and cash flow in contrast to 2019. While 2019 opened a new chapter for the company, 2020 offers the opportunity to amplify the impact of our new performance vision for the benefit of our customers and to accelerate key strategy elements to improve returns for the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you very much for your participation today. Good day to everyone. I look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-18 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Simon Farrant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. And welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2019 earnings call. Today’s call is being hosted from New York City, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held here this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call will take a slightly different format. We have shortened our prepared remarks in order to leave more time for your questions. Olivier will start the call with his prospective on the quarter, after which Simon Ayat will give more details on the financial results. Then we will open up for your questions.  As always, before we begin, I’d like to remind the participants that some of the statem .ents we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. Now, I will turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I would like to ask through the earnings release my comments on the quarter before covering some of the points critical to understand. First of all, as you have seen in our release this morning, we have taken enough of the non-cash $12.7 billion charge. This charge reflects the impact of market conditions have had on the valuation of our goodwill intangibles and fixed assets. None of these changes our ability to generate strong cash flow as these quarters has once again demonstrated, leaving us flexibility to navigate a more uncertain market landscape. Simon Ayat will discuss the charge during his remarks. I will now comment on our Q3 operational performance followed by the short-term outlook and conclude with a brief update on our strategy implementation. Our third quarter results were very positive in a mixed market environment, driven by strong international performance. The international margins improved and we delivered more than $1 billion in free cash flow. Additionally, we recorded the best ever quarterly safety performance for the company, an outstanding achievement setting new safety performance benchmarks for our industry. All-in-all, very solid quarter aligned with our performance vision and our focus on returns. I am very pleased with the results and I am proud of the Schlumberger team that delivered this performance. The financial results this quarter were driven by the strength of activity in the key international markets. Some activity picked in Russia, the CIS and the North Sea, the Far East and Asia regions also saw strong growth and new projects began in sub-Sahara and North Africa. Only Latin America revenue was lower on reduced activity in Mexico and Argentina. In North America, we experienced strong offshore sales offset by minimal growth on land. OneStim activity was modestly higher, recovering from the spring break up in Canada during Q2. Towards the end of the quarter, however, we saw lower pricing and increased gaps in the frac calendar, customer award programs were constrained by cash flow. North America land drilling revenue was essentially flat, despite rig count reductions as our fit-for-basin technology access approach equipped -- on equipment sales and leasing as offset decline. Cameron results closed in line with expectations. This included robust operating margins, building on sequential growth in most international regions, which were offset partially by declining activity in North America at the end of the quarter. Our international performance this quarter was very solid, with the high double-digit basis points improvement in our margin on the back of 3% sequential revenue growth. More than two-third of our product lines and GeoMarkets posted both sequential revenue growth and margin expansion. Leveraging [indiscernible], offshore and exploration activity mix, and the deployment of new technology. At the closing of this quarter, half of our international GeoMarkets have posted year-to-date double-digit revenue growth. This improvement in international margins was achieved, despite the lingering and sustained effect of a handful of contract that are highly dilutive. Without the effect of these underperforming business units, our growth in international margins would have been even greater. We are making progress engaging with our customers on those contracts, working collaboratively to improve terms and condition and to enlist their support to improve our operations. As part of this plan, I have been taking personal actions during the last few weeks and anticipate visible progress during the coming months and quarters. Margin improvement and change on capital deployments are both part of our increasingly retail focused approach under the new capital stewardship element of the strategy. As international activity increases, our deployment of CapEx will be further prioritized towards the business units with higher returns. This action together with increasing activity is starting to create some tightness in the market which is a catalyst for pricing improvements. Now, I will move on to the short-term outlook for our business. Based on our Q3 year-to-date results and our outlook for Q4, we still expect full year high single-digit international revenue growth excluding [Cameron]. Sequentially, however, Q4 will include the seasonal activity decline in the Northern hemisphere and we anticipate only muted year-end sales. We are also closely monitoring the situation in the Ecuador following the recent events and are preparing for further decline in Argentina. In addition, we expect seasonal weakness in North America as the fourth quarter develops. We are anticipating a year end slowdown in North America similar to last year due to operator budget constraints. However, this year the activity reduction has started earlier than last and we anticipate the second should decline in Q4 to be more pronounced than last year. Moving on to the macro and medium-term view, the macro environment remains challenged with limited visibility, particularly in view of the global trade concerns that are challenging both economic growth and the rate of oil demand growth. At the same time, the U.S. production growth rate has declined for the last eight months and it is expected to drop further in 2020 as a result of the reduced activity this year. Therefore, and that’s sort of a recession, the prospects for international activity growth remain firmly in place. In this market context, our approach in North America land is under evaluation, for both the medium- and the long-term. We are already scaling to fit the OneStim business and we will be starting fleet as the market contracts during the fourth quarter. At the same time, the strategic review of this market is well underway and will be completed during the fourth quarter for execution early next year. This gives me the opportunity to update you on our strategy execution. Last month, we presented four key elements of that strategy that included leading and driving digital transformation in our industry, developing fit-for-basin solutions, capturing value from the performance impact for our customers and fostering capital stewardship. Performance is at the heart of this new strategic direction. We are already off to an excellent start on digital. We presented our vision of the E&P industry to 800 customers and technology partners at the global SIS Forum in September. There, we demonstrated our firm commitment to an open digital environment that we believe can unlock further customer performance. This Forum marks a new chapter for the digital future of our industry. The intellects from our customers and digital partners was far beyond our expectations and is already translated into sizable opportunities. The central JV is also an important part of our digital strategy and the announcement of its closing reinforces our leadership of, and commitments to the industry digital transformation. We are also making progress with our new fit-for-basin strategic approach. In the release today, there are multiple examples of fit-for-basin technology, all of which drive our customer performance, such as NeoSteer at-bit steerable system and Aegis drillbit technology. In addition, in North America, I am pleased to report early success of the technology access strategy, we have said and leasing of rotary steerable tools. This is a new channel that access to new markets where our participation was previously minimal. Also in North America, our flagship project with Oxy in the Aventine Basin is now operating at scale. We have continuously improved operational efficiency, setting new frac goals in the Delaware. The value being created is shared through underlined commercial model and is a good example of our new strategy performance model approach. Finally, as another base to our SPM strategy, we have big progress in our divestiture of Argentina assets as we have few offers in hand that we are altering with the anticipation to finalize with the other party during the upcoming months. Since taking the role as CEO for Schlumberger, I have made the point of visiting many of our customers, our people and our locations. The reception by our customers bode for engagements and strategic direction has been very positive. The enthusiasm of our people has been highly motivating and their commitment is evident. The industry is acknowledging the need for higher performance in the New York. All-in-all, I am very pleased with the initial steps of our strategic execution and we have internal and external alignments with our vision to become the performance partner of choice in our industry. I will now pass the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Olivier. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share was $0.43 excluding charges and credits. This represents an increase of $0.08 sequentially and a decrease of $0.03 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter we recorded $12.7 billion of pretax charges driven by market conditions. These charges primarily relate to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed asset impairments. As such this charge is almost entirely non-cash. Details of the component of this charge can be found in the FAQs, at the end of our earnings press release. These impairments were calculated as of August 31, 2019. Accordingly, the third quarters’ results benefited from a $27 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense. Approximately $21 million of this $27 million monthly reduction relates to the production group. The remaining $6 million is reflected in our corporate and other line item. The after-tax impact of this one-month reduction is approximately $0.015 in terms of EPS. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion increased 3% sequentially, largely driven by our international operations. Pretax segment operating margin increased by 113 basis points to 12.8%. Highlights by product group were as follows. Third quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 6% sequentially. While margins increased 149 basis points to 21.8%. These increases were primarily driven by strong international wireline activity and higher WesternGeco multi-client license sales in North America. Drilling revenue of $2.5 billion increased 2% driven by stronger drilling activity in Russia, China and Australia. However, this was partially offset by lower revenue in North America land and Saudi Arabia. Margins were flat at 12.4%. Production revenue of $3.2 billion increased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by strong international completions activity. Margin increased 148 basis points to 9.1%, primarily driven by improved international margins from higher activity. The reduction in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the third quarter impairment charge accounted for just under half of the margin improvement. Cameron revenue of $1.4 billion increased 3% sequentially primarily driven by OneSubsea margins increased 29 basis points to 12.7%. The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle business was 0.8 in Q3. The OneSubsea backlog increased -- decreased to $1.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. This decrease reflects a cancelled project in the North Sea. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 16% in the third quarter, as compared to 16.7% in the previous quarter. We generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations during the third quarter. Our net debt improved by $347 million during the quarter to $14.4 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $2.3 billion. We received $250 million in cash and just after the quarter as a result of the closing of the Sensia joint venture. During the third quarter, we issued the three tranches of EUR500 million notes each. The first is due in 2024 at 0%, the second due in 2027 at 0.25% and third due in 2031 at 0.5%. These notes were subsequently swapped into U.S. dollars with the weighted average interest rate of 2.5%. During the quarter, we also repurchased $783 million of our outstanding 3% notes due in 2020 and $321 million of our outstanding 3.625% notes due in 2022. These actions have served to improve the company’s capital structure. During the quarter, we spent $79 million to repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of $36.64. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included, CapEx of $415 million and capitalized costs relating to SPM projects of $194 million. During the quarter, we also made $692 million of dividend payments. Full year 2019 CapEx, excluding SPM and market client is expected to be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. And now, I will turn the conference over to operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First we go to the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey. Good morning, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.
James West: So, Olivier, as you exited the third quarter, could you describe what the market conditions were, how we should think about the fourth quarter? It sounds like sequentially down. And then also, how is 2020, in your view, starting to shape up?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. No. Let me comment on this, James. So I will separate my comments between international and North America land, specifically. So first on the international side, I think, similar to what we see every year, there is a seasonal effect in the Northern Hemisphere due to the winter season that affects primarily Russia, it affects then China and the North Sea. And we see and affect every year on the rig activity and our revenue that we collect from those regions. So this is not unusual. We don’t expect any minimal impact than we have every other year, but I think this is something to account for. We typically on year-ends also have year-end sales of product equipment and we believe this could happen, but this will be as we have seen the last two years or three years, fairly muted annual sales as the operator will remain cautious on their budget in preparation for 2020. On the flip side, on the North America land, as I did comment in my introduction remarks, I believe that the rate of decline will be at a risk to be higher than last year as for two reasons. The usual holiday season break in the winter, I think, is looming. But also we have seen that the [inaudible] absorption and discipline on operating within cash flow has led operator to cease operation earlier than they did last year. We have started to give notice of operation gap from September and the rate of the decision has been accelerating. So we expect as a consequence that the rate of decline quarter-on-quarter in North America might be higher than last year sequential delcine. Now turning to next year, I think, at some of -- a major, as I commented, a major recession or major event geopolitical or economic events. We foresee that international growth will remain in place, albeit possibly at a different lower rate possibly. But we believe that the strength of offshore activity deepwater or shallow will not cease overnight and we continue to support 2020 international growth. When it comes to North America, it’s too early to call. I believe that the market is still lacks stability and we can only comment on the rebounds in Q1 that is usual rebounds from the holiday season that we foresee happening, the strengthening of activity from January, possibly strengthening of pricing, but this is too early to call.
James West: Okay. That’s very helpful, Olivier. Thank you. And then with respect to the charges that were taken during the quarter, understanding they only helped EPS by about $0.015 here. What drove the timing here of taking these charges especially kind of midyear, why not end of last year?
Simon Ayat: James, Simon here. I will take this.
James West: Hey, Simon.
Simon Ayat: Basically -- hi. During -- there are two events that took place in the third quarter that made us look at closely at the carrying value of our assets. One is the new strategy by Olivier, which has been publicly announced and discussed, and we continue to develop it as we go forward. The other one is the market valuation that we have seen. Although, we have touched lower points before, I will take the second reason first and then discuss the first one.
James West: Sure.
Simon Ayat: Although, we are -- we have see lower valuations before, but during the third quarter were more consistent and frankly very low point, unfortunately. That forced us to look at our goodwill and intangible carrying value. As you are aware, most of the goodwill and intangible comes from two major acquisitions. In 2010, we did the Smith acquisition, which was almost 100% paid by stock. We issued 138 million shares at that time, and then, Cameron in 2016, where we paid almost 78% in stock. The book value of those two acquisitions were booked for Smith at $56 per share, for Cameron at $72 per share. As such, our carrying value of the goodwill and intangible it’s inflated, given where our valuation is. And this has taken very long analysis, pretty scientific actually and we reached this number. Why it is in Q3? Because it is a Q3 event. We record things as they happen. We don’t -- we are not influenced by timing. Yes, normally at the end of the year you do a more thorough review. But given the changes we have seen in Q3 we did this thorough review in Q3. The other items that you have seen, which is mainly increased asset impairment and mainly in OneStim North America, is a reflection of our actions toward this activity. As Olivier mentioned, we are looking at this activity. We have excess capacity there. And we have taken the decision that this is unfair. We don’t see it as reactivated in the near future and we took the decision to write it off. So I covered the reasons behind it. I know I answered more than what you asked, but I wanted to make sure that everybody understands our approach and why it is a Q3. It’s not just because we had a change of mind. It is a reflection of real issues that took place in the third quarter.
James West: Got it. Thanks, gentlemen.
Simon Ayat: Sure.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Good morning, Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Angie.
Angie Sedita: So I appreciate the color on the international markets and a little bit of a follow-up there on pace of growth for 2020. I know it’s early, but do you still feel comfortable with mid single-digit revenue growth in 2020 or is it still a bit early to tell for sure? And then also, I guess, I would add to that, the asset sales that occurred in 2019, the impact on both revenues and margins?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. Let me take that first and then I will address the second one. So, it’s -- I think to be clear as mid single-digit rather than low or high. I think it’s too early to pull and call at this point. Not that we don’t have good visibility. But I think the customer are still in the process of setting their vision for 2020 and are serving the macroeconomic factor that you all know about and I think we have to be cautious here. We believe that the continuum of offshore activity and the momentum that the industry has set there is not here to stop, particularly on the deepwater side. But I think some other region and some other basin would be more at risk of a decline in activity or decline in reject for next year. So it’s too early to call, but clearly, we see growth in international next year. So when it comes to the impact of the announcement -- announced divestiture, so we have three divestitures underway. One is already closed, the Sensia. That has been closed two weeks ago. The second one relates to the divestiture of asset to the JV that we own with EDC. And the third one relates to drilling and tubular accessories tubes to shape that we are divesting. So when you look at the impact of these three on a yearly basis, the revenue will be short 2% of global revenue. The impact when you combine the three, when the three will be completely closed and completed and the impact on the earnings will be $0.01 to $0.02 for the year. So, Simon, may want to add more, but that’s the impact on a full year basis.
Simon Ayat: I just want to explain that two of the transactions or the divestitures are basically creating JVs or one is creating the JV of Sensia, the other one enhancing the JV of EDC Drilling in the Middle East. So we are losing the revenue and the reason we are not losing as much in earnings is because we will have a higher pickup of our equity participation in the two JVs. And the third one has a really minimal impact on the profitability. And therefore, as Olivier mentioned, it’s $0.01 to $0.02 per year impact on margin. However, the revenue is a larger impact, less than 2% of the total.
Angie Sedita: Okay. Perfect. That’s very, very helpful. I appreciate the color. And then, I guess, a little bit further on the international side, thoughts around the pace of margin growth for 2020, given your initiatives on the transformation, digital, and obviously, these asset sales as well? But -- and then these contracts that you are trying to address in the Middle East, so just talk about margins for next year on international and the pace?
Olivier Le Peuch: So I will not comment on the target -- the target’s not set. But the ambition we have is to continue to grow and expand our margin internationally and we have seen that we have the high double-digit basis point improvement during the quarter. I will continue to look and work using the strategy to execute to a part of margin expansion for the year. So if you look at it from a very high level, there are three buckets what -- that we see. The first one relates to our ability to resolve some of the underperforming business units, the highly dilutive contracts that are lingering and impacting our results. We have made some progress, not to the pace I would have expected necessarily on being very ambitious this year, but I think, I am confident that we have a path to improve this that will impact the results next year. Similarly, in the first bucket I would put continuing to execute using our new modernized platform of operating system. And I think we are setting a two years rollout to complete our transformation internationally and I look forward to have also some pull-through on that operating model with efficiency of self-help, as we call it, impact on our margins. And next bucket is, obviously, I will call it the digital and all the technology, trying to replicate some of the success we have seen in North America oversees in technology access to third-party regional players who are accessing our technology and using it in lieu of CapEx in terms of the markets. And digital where we expect that the outcome of what we have just done last months and the momentum that we have gained in the industry will give us an increased share of the digital market and as such will be contributing to the margin. So last would be further long-term outlook and the performance model and other horizon of growth that we will disclose later. But I believe these two buckets will clearly impact the next two years or three years, but it’s difficult to say at this moment. But our ambition is to grow the international margin next year, indeed.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. I will turn it over, guys.
Simon Ayat: Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Olivier. So on your fit-for-basin strategy, obviously, you are focused on the North American business right now and after writing down assets during the quarter, you talked about more of a strategic review in the fourth quarter. We are talking about 2020 numbers, but it’s kind of hard to get there with all these changes happening in North America. I was wondering if you could just kind of lay out a little bit of kind of what you guys are looking at, like, what parts of the North America business are under the strategic review and should we expect broader retrenchments in certain parts of the U.S. land business next year?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. A very good question, David. So as we have explained during the strategy presentation back a month-and-a-half ago, we are doing a deep review of the entire business we are operating on North America land and this is not only OneStim but every part of our business there. And the first thing we are doing is we are doing a scale-to-fit approach to the market view, meaning that we are not doing up to scale. We are doing up to scale where we believe it fits for every business in every basin. So this is what we are in the middle of doing as we speak for OneStim in each of the basins where we operate and for each of the product lines where we are currently operating in the North America land. So that is the scale-to-fit approach to our strategy to review the outlook, to review our market position, to review our strengths, anticipate the technology and opportunity with customers, and making a decision at that point on how to treat this portfolio and move forward with a reduced portfolio more fit to one or multiple basin as opposed to all basins or make a decision to change the business model to grow for technology access, setting up our technology as opposed to operating our technology. So that’s the approach we are taking. As we speak, we are complement this by recognizing that there are some technologies that we have developed that are highly successful and we continue to feed our technology team with what we need to differentiate in basin to create the performance impact. We have seen some of the release of the -- and the success we have had have helped us actually maintain is not last quarter, slightly improve our margin, excluding the term of effect in North America land due to the effect of this technology success. So we will continue to bring us technology and we are looking at our portfolio of business in North America and making a decision to exit or continue and expand or move to a new business model. So to early to say, but yes, all option on the table, partly for the OneStim, as it is certainly as you know, they are dilutive business to our all business in North America.
David Anderson: Thank you. Kind of a slightly different question on North America, you highlighted some offshore strength which was a bit of a surprise and granted there’s some seismic here. But you made a few comments about offshore being a support for the market next year. You actually highlighted international there. But I am just wondering if this is a harbinger of things to come for offshore in general and just trying to tie that into the lower subsea Cameron orders this quarter. How do you see that trending over the next two quarters, because it sounds like you are somewhat optimistic on offshore, but I don’t want to put words into your mouth there?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Let me comments on this. So the view I have is that the offshore market is a market that doesn’t compact and expand on a monthly or on a quarterly basis. It’s more steady and it is more longer -- long cycle and that’s partially true for deepwater. So we have seen growth because we slow recovery of deepwater for the last 18 months. We have seen faster recovery of the shale in the last 12 months. So we believe that some of these fundamentals will stay in place. Not necessarily long-term, it’s too early to call, but to the medium-term it is the case. So I believe that the momentum that this market has is here to stay for the foreseeable six months to nine months, beyond that is too early to say. The FID and the rate of FID for subsea have not necessarily slowed down. I think some of them have been delayed for technical reasons. But we expect some of the key FID to be approved later part of this year, early next year. The subsea or OneSubsea, looking this quarter, I think, is a matter of scheduling of how and when this booking comes in seconds. We are still having a book-to-bill ratio year-to-date largely above 1 for OneSubsea. So as you can see that the subsea recovery is in place and we continue to unfold.
David Anderson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yeah. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: Can you provide some color around the outlook for improvement under the new strategy? In EBITDA dollars, in free cash dollars, since assets are being removed from the portfolio to optimize around the core, margins will obviously improve. But could you provide some color around your ability to grow cash flow and free cash flow dollars, assuming limited market assistance?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think the first and foremost ability that we have to grow cash flow is to improve margins, clearly, and that’s the first foremost. The next one for cash flow is ability to improve our working capital efficiency, both of which we have demonstrated this quarter. Long-term, obviously, it depends on the mix and where we have seen growth in margin improvement. So I still believe that fundamental international growth that we is still in place where we have a premium on margin compared to North America. The effects and execution of our strategy, scale to fit to fix North America and to enhance our net margin in dollar, as well as in percentage were both combined to improve our margins. We believe that the asset efficiency that we have improved over the last couple of years due to our transformation, combined with modernization of our working platform to -- will continue to have positive effect on working capital efficiencies. So you combine all this, I still believe that the ability to deliver cash will only improve and the total cash conserving, absent of a recession will improve going forward. You want to add anything, Simon?
Simon Ayat: You said most of the things. The issue of the cash flow definitely it is earnings first and then the management of our capital structure and the working capital. We normally do very well in the second half, as you have seen. Third quarter was $1.1 billion and we anticipate the fourth quarter to be even better than this performance. In terms of next year, we have a plan to continue to be very cautious in our capital deployment, and this will help the free cash flow and continue the performance on our working capital. Our working capital is normally subject of receivables inventories. We know where we stand. We always have our pockets of collections here and there and we intend to soften them. And we feel comfortable between our generation of cash from operations and the -- some of the divestitures that are coming will be more than sufficient to meet all our commitments, including the dividend. One more thing to add about next year, you don’t see lower SPM investments because of what we already announced that we are going to divest and we are going to -- it doesn’t require as much as we have done in the current year.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And at this point are you comfortable with the mentioning of the drop in SPM CapEx?
Olivier Le Peuch: I am sorry?
Scott Gruber: Are you willing to mention where SPM CapEx is going next year?
Olivier Le Peuch: Well, SPM CapEx this year is around 750. And we anticipate that this will be much lower next year. I mean, when -- I don’t know exactly where, we have not finalized all the plans, but start of 500, 400, probably.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then one additional question, one tweak to the strategy seems to be a willingness to selectively sell or lease technologies in various markets to third parties, which will then provide the service of wellsite deployment. Can you provide some color on this tweak to the strategy and what is the breadth of this strategy by-product line? Which geographies are you looking at deploying the new strategy? And importantly, how do you get comfortable around not creating additional competition in these various markets?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. Scott, this strategy, we call technology access subset of fit-for-basin, where we believe that in target basins, particularly the hybrid basin, the capital intensity that is required to fulfill and prosper in the basin and the high competitiveness by local players is out there in both condition that is capping our market access. So we have realized and we have tested this in North America and we are accelerating the opportunity to lease or sell selective technology that we believe can help us access markets that we were not accessing before. So these are two consequences. Our first is new business model that is attributive to our goals and our returns. And, secondly, is to lower our capital intensity, as we typically sell these assets. So we don’t require CapEx to expand in this marketplace. So where do we do this? Typically, where there is a set of local competitors, for one, which is highly located in North America, where if you were to take the drilling space, there more than 50 local competitors are competing in drilling services. We expect this to be the case in Middle East where there are regional players and other parts of the world where there hybrid basin. But when it comes to product line, the drilling is one, obviously, this is where we started. But we will not stop there. We are doing it for some of our perforating equipment in Wireline and continue to expand and we are currently accessing a part of the strategy for every product line. The portfolio that we are waiting to sell was specifically designed to sell and or lease to third-party. This tool capacity we have as well helps because we provide detailed services and retooling of this equipment, so to assure that the performance of this technology is up on par with the capability of this technology. So am I comfortable? Yes. When we put the right term and condition with those third-party company to operate in a different scope with the different set of customer. We are clear and we are becoming increasingly comfortable, as well as they are, as they are successful in deploying our technology and we are successful in supporting them and then expanding our market access.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you. Welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Connor Lynagh: Thank you. Good morning
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Connor Lynagh: I wanted to stick with the CapEx team here. In the core oil services business, how would you think about how much you can take out in 2020 spending, obviously with production group activity coming down, I would think there would be a decent amount of sustaining CapEx reduction there, but any thoughts around that.
Olivier Le Peuch: I think it’s too early to be specific and got it down to the production group at this stage. We are pretty advanced on that. We execute the strategy in North America where there are similar volumes of production group operating there and this is too early as some of the activity level is not set yet for North America and popular. Globally speaking, as announced that we shared before has been 5% to 7% we believe. We believe with the mix of the product line that we have, the recent divestiture of some asset, heavy product line, combined with what we anticipated in North America. I would say almost independently of the strategic execution, we mean that we will stay within the guidance.
Connor Lynagh: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you. I guess a broader question here, you have continue to highlight your digital strategy. I think many investors have a hard time thinking through the addressable market or how big a business this could be for you? How do you think about what the opportunity set is in a multiyear view for that business?
Olivier Le Peuch: Actually, it’s a very big market. I think, you said, long-term for the oil and gas industry is one of the biggest market that will grow over the next five years to 10 years. I believe if I had to judge by the response from oil customers, the desire they have work with us first and the alignment from oil partners industry, a leader in the diesel technology or cost of industry, which are all aligning to our business. So the price is big. Now the challenge is to monetize. So as we said, there are three factor and three direction there. One is the -- one is -- what revenue in the Sensia has established a leadership into digital workflows, and we believe they will only expand the adoption of DELFI by other customer today is only about a growth and this expansion remain accelerating the rate of growth of a side as a segment in our portfolio and it comes at margin that are credit to our business everywhere. So I believe this will only continue and accelerate. WesternGeco is the data digital -- data digital branch of our -- first line of our business and I think we are termed and transformed with success, WesternGeco from an asset heavy into an asset light product line last year and we have technologies with an aggressive detailed strategy where we have established data platform GAIA that we have released, that will become the industry reference by exchanging and monetizing data as you have seen with the announcement of IHS Markit joining us on this platform. And finally, we will continue to deploy digital at the edge in operation. The sense that -- of this ambition for the production space and you have seen that we are expanding deal production into the ring, you will see that will continue to make announcement in that space this operation. And Ora, the Wireline, latest generation of fleet sampling characterization is becoming full digital and is success and expansion will become a key factor of this success. So this multi-dimension is large and its long-term and we are leading in this space.
Connor Lynagh: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next we go to Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning. Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: Thank you. Thank you for all the great color here this morning. I -- follow-up question I had kind of does sales back to the strategy presentation from a month and a half ago. And in that presentation, you -- Olivier you clearly stated, the intention to increase international North American margins by at least 500 basis points. And to my curiosity that in the context of that 500 basis point improvement how much of that can be attributed to the improvement in the current contractual dynamics vis-à-vis the execution of the strategy you outlined, specifically the digital, the fit-for-basin and the performance models, if you could provide some additional color on how you see that kind of mapping through that be great?
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Kurt, I think, as I did comment to Angie before, I see that the expansion of the performance EPS would gone for two or three buckets. And one of them is short-term and is the one addressing is more personal and contractual, is the one addressing underperforming business unit and is our ability to operate at the benchmark being performance and that’s the performance transformation we are doing internally that’s the self help if you want. So that is the target of our -- all of our team and the focus is very high on this and our personal overview on each of these every quarter. For the next, you mentioned, the next bucket, and I think the one that will certainly have the most impact the next three years to five years will be the mix of digital, fit-for-basin and technology assets internationally. We have technology assets in Middle East, we will have digital everywhere and we will have some fit-for-basin from Russia to Latin America from China to Mexico. So that’s what we expect to and I am confident that as we deploy this over the next few years. These three fit-for-basin, performance model and digital will contribute on this.
Kurt Hallead: Right. I appreciate that. And then a follow-up I had was on the, you gave some broad general guidance in terms of business direction. So I am just kind of curious, when you look at the lower depreciation, it was about a $0.015 impact for the core for the quarter that I guess was only one month. So if you annualize you should get a positive $0.18 per share benefit from lower depreciation. I don’t know it seems to me like the headwinds on the market potentially offset that benefit as you head out into 2020. Do you have any kind of initial perspectives on that? Do you think, my assumption is kind of my gut instinct is correct on that?
Olivier Le Peuch: So, first, I think your maths are correct. I think the annualizing this $0.015 will generate more or less the $0.18 net impact in same scope. Now would it be offsetting to the decline. I think it’s early too early to say. I think again we are looking at the outlook. As I commented before the outlook in international remain likely positive on both. The outlook on that is too early to call at this point that we reached the bottom in that and we expecting to expect 2020 platform, 2019 or with the regional outlook on in 2020 too early to say. So I will remain cautious about calling this at this point, but I think your assumption quite strong for the impact in this.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. Great. And then one -- maybe one last one, I noticed in the press release you mentioned that there was a project cancellation in subsea, was that a project that came through earlier in the year or was it kind of a dynamic?
Olivier Le Peuch: No.
Kurt Hallead: Yeah.
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Actually no. It’s an order booking that was awarded to OneSubsea sometime ago and more than one year or two years ago. That was put on the back burner from future FID and this asset said was actually subsequently sold from one operator to the next and the next and the next operator, other than the gain on -- decided to cancel and rethink its option for the FID and as such we have to remove the booking from the backlog. That’s as simple as that.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That’s great. Thank you so much for that. Appreciate it.
Operator: Next, we go to Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Thanks. Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Sean.
Sean Meakim: So Olivier to follow up on SPM, it’s been a challenging few months in terms of the macro and Argentina and Ecuador, based on your comments of lower CapEx spend next year, does that suggest you are still confident and affecting the asset sale in Argentina in the near-term? And then also just you wrote some smaller SPM assets, can you maybe elaborate on their impact in terms of CapEx and just -- are we still confident that cash flow for SPM as a whole is exiting 2019 positively, now we have some impact on production in Ecuador?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah. So let me comment one by one. So first, the process of the asset divestiture in -- for Bandurria Sur in Argentina is progressing. We have completed the first phase, where we received actually offer and we have offers few others in hand that we are looking as we speak. So we still do anticipate and we work every step to get signing and closing in the following months. So, yes, we account for this as an impact for 2020. We are not making a decision at this point to divest any other assets. The Ecuador, the Torxen will be the main asset that remained on the SPM portfolio. The other asset that we are working with to -- in the interim are much smaller, we are initiated a few years back are not meaningful in terms of the impact on CapEx nor in term of production revenue for SPM. So, in term of cash flow, yes, our commitment is to operate within cash flow and the cash flow will be positive and improving next year compared to this year considering the divestiture we are making. And we are committed to continue to keep it is, so we will be lower CapEx and increased cash flow from the SPM contribution.
Sean Meakim: Thank you for that. That’s very helpful. And then, just given the growing importance of digital in your go-forward strategy are you able to quantify the baseline of digital contribution today. I know some parts would be difficult to quantify, but in reference point of the common investor question. And with respect to the margin impact, is it mostly accretion from software, just higher margin product or their internal OpEx benefit you can get as well.
Olivier Le Peuch: No. Sean, I think, we look at it from a digital as a business that has two characteristics. First, it is something that is transformative for the industry and is something that is having high price for all operator. So we need to be in this business and we believe the rate of growth of digital is here to stay on the accelerator. So it will be part of that and that’s really the one -- the most important factor. The other characteristic is that when we operated well and we have the right IP and operating model there, we have been able to be generating margin that are highly accretive, which has been the case for the last 10 years to 15 years with the size. So it will continue to increase, its contribution going forward, but I cannot come out at this point, until we see the 2020 plan and we see that the outcome of all leads and opportunity that we have reached during the last months following the SI score.
Sean Meakim: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess the first one, I will start on 4Q. I am just trying to think about the outlook for fourth quarter. I guess 3Q you have $0.43 if we kind of gross it up for the $0.03 of the lower D&A for the full quarter. That’s a $0.46 number and it sounded like North America will be significantly down in the fourth quarter, and I wasn’t sure about international if it will be up or not from your commentary. But can you maybe help us kind of bridge the gap from that $0.46 number and how much EPS could potentially be down?
Olivier Le Peuch: I would comment on the activity, I will not give quantitative guidance on the EPS at this point and I will repeat what I shared during my introduction remarks. The -- what we see on international is sequentially, we see an anticipated activity decline in rigs and activity can large will be down due to seasonal effect, winter season in Northern Hemisphere that is here to stay up once every year. The magnitude of it will depend in Russia, particularly in the North Sea, Russia and China to this extent have this effect. We don’t anticipate to see a tangible, if any year end sales that could offset this partially or fully and we have some exposure as mentioned as counted before in Argentina. That could also further decline due to the investment climate that has moved there. And finally, you heard about the Ecuador. Ecuador civil unrest that happened week and a half ago, which have some consequence on our operation for about a week, a bit less than a week, where we restored production at this stage. But -- so this is a combination of impact that we foresee for international. That means not activity increase for sure. Now, in the North America, I think, it’s more difficult to exactly point -- pin point where the market will end up internal activity, but the rate of decline on the permits, the rate of decline on the risk that has accelerated from July to September. The rate of decision in the last few days and weeks on the pulling pipe commitment for the following three months has accelerated. And as such, we anticipate that the year-on-year the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 in North America will be greater than it was last year.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. All right. Understood. Got all that. And then just coming back to Sean’s question on the digital side, it sounds like that you have got a lot of revenue opportunity on the digital side as we kind of move forward over the medium to longer term. Could you talk about which businesses, you see the most opportunity to leverage digital and then ultimately how meaningful of a revenue opportunity do you think this could be for Schlumberger?
Olivier Le Peuch: The one first and foremost the business line that will benefit is the SIS and then WesternGeco, which are already fully invested into the digital workflow and digital data marketplace. So that will continue to expand, relative growth I think needs to be to be seen, but the momentum is there and the early success -- early indications are quite encouraging. The next one, I would say, is Drilling. We happen to have a platform including the -- in the future and some software including the Hilox [ph] and drill plan that we announced commercial during this assessment. That when combined give the opportunity to create a digital automation at the scale of a week, full operation, but the scale of self process in drilling rig and this can be productized and applied to platform offshore to platform and the rig in hand. And we are working with operator as we see speak to accelerate this productization and to make it a meaningful impact of the drilling. And finally, production will be building on the success we are willing to create with JV -- Sensia JV and working very closely with Rockwell Automation. I will be speaking to the Automation Fair in a month in Chicago and meeting their Board to make sure that we are fully aligned to build the support to this Sensia JV.
Chase Mulvehill: Got it. Understood. All right. I will turn it back over. Thanks.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much. So before we conclude the call today, I would like to reiterate three key points. First, our Q3 performance was very solid. We expect international margins, while mitigating the North America land activity headwind. We delivered strong free cash flow and recall safety performance. Second, the new company vision is gaining industry wide acceptance and the initial progress on the strategic execution is very encouraging. Third, we have adopted capital strategy as an operational mindset to deliver increase the terms, to investment discipline, optimization of working capital and overall margin expansion. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation today. Lya, you may now conclude the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-19 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2019 earnings call. Today's call is being recorded from Paris, France following a Schlumberger Limited Board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Operating Officer. We will as usual first go through our prepared remarks, after which we'll open up for questions. For today's agenda, Simon will first present comments on our second quarter financial performance before Olivier reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro. However, before we begin, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now I'll hand the call over to Simon Ayat.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share was $0.35. Excluding charges and credits, this represents an increase of $0.05 sequentially and a decrease of $0.08 when compared to the same quarter last year. There were no charges or credits recorded during the quarter. Our second quarter revenue of $8.3 billion increased 5% sequentially, largely driven by our international operations. Pretax segment operating margins increased by 17 basis points to 11.7%. Highlights by product group were as follows: Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion increased 7% sequentially due to activity increases beyond the normal seasonal improvements we typically experience in Q2. These increases were primarily driven by strong multiclient license sales and higher international Wireline activity. Margins increased 81 basis points to 19.8% due to the increased contributions from higher margin Wireline activity and multiclient. Drilling revenue of $2.4 billion increased 1% as a stronger activity in the International Areas was partially offset by lower drilling activity in North America land. Margins decreased 45 basis points to 12.4%. Production revenue of $3.1 billion increased 6.5% sequentially, primarily driven by higher international activity across all the product lines. Margins were essentially flat at 8% as the improvements in international margins from higher activity was offset by the effects of pricing pressure in North America land. Cameron revenue of $1.2 billion increased 5% sequentially. Margins increased 94 basis points to 12.6%. These increases were primarily driven by OneSubsea and Surface Systems. The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle businesses was 1.2 in the second quarter. The OneSubsea backlog increased to $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 16.7% in the second quarter compared to 15.5% in the previous quarter. This increase was a result of the geographic mix of earnings. In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.1 billion from operations leading to $459 million of free cash flow. Good performance for the second quarter despite the temporary delays in receivable collection that we experienced in certain regions. Our net debt increased $335 million during the quarter to $14.7 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $2.3 billion. During the quarter, we spent $101 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares at an average price of $40.12. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $404 million and capitalized cost relating to SPM projects of $181 million. During the quarter, we also made $693 million of dividend payments. Full year 2019 CapEx, excluding SPM and multiclient investment, is still expected to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. And now I will turn the conference call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter revenue increased 5% sequentially, driven by international activity. Our international business grew 8%, outperforming international rig count growth of 6%, while North America revenue grew 2% sequentially. I am pleased with the progress made and proud of our team performance, many of whom I met during the quarter on my visits to our global operations. My comments today will include the Cameron business. I will start with our North America operation. In North America, consolidated revenue was 2% higher sequentially with land revenue growing marginally, while offshore grew 10%. Production revenue increased 3% due to higher cementing revenue and improved OneStim hydraulic fracturing fleet utilization in response to market demand. These positive factors, however, were offset by the spring breakup in Canada and lower demand for drilling services as a result of the 5% decline in U.S. land rig count. North America land remains a challenging environment. Indeed, the E&P operator focus on cash flow has capped activity, and continued efficiency improvements have also reduced the number of active rigs and frac fleets, so far without major impact on oil production. In response, we continue our returns-focused approach, deploying new technology and working closely with the major independents and IOCs that are initializing the development of unconventional shale resource at increasing scale. Our competitive advantage in North America land operation continues to build on our differentiation in technology and efficiency. Surface efficiency is one area where we have made significant progress. One new technology is the MonoFlex, our new fracturing fluid delivery system, which significantly speeds up multiwell pad rig-up, and reduces nonproductive time and safety risk. Reservoir efficiency is another key issue for our customers. We are seeing increasing take up of technologies that help customer design and deploy completion that mitigates or avoids parent-child well interference. Two such technologies are BroadBand Shield and Fulcrum cement. BroadBand Shield innovative fracture control technology limits the risk of communicating with or fracturing into nearby wells. By the end of June, BroadBand Shield services has been used on nearly double the number stage when compared to all of 2019. Fulcrum cement improves stimulation efficiency by helping keep fracturing fluid in the target reservoir zone by improving the cement bond. In the second quarter, Fulcrum technology deployments tripled versus the previous quarter and double in the first half when compared to full year 2018. In our other North America land businesses, Surface System grew 5% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. This was driven by the frac tree rental business, benefiting from MonoFlex technology and integration with OneStim. Artificial Lift was strong with sequential ESP sales growth of 5% from new technology and fit-for-purpose pump systems that outpaced low-flow service revenue. Offshore North America, revenue increased 10% sequentially, primarily due to strong WesternGeco multiclient license sales. While offshore rig count has yet to increase significantly, customer interest is high, indicating stronger activity coming in the second half of the year. With the North America market remaining challenged in the coming months, we continue to protect our operating margin by focusing on our agile execution and operational efficiency. In the international markets, we continue to witness broad-based activity growth. More than half of the international GeoMarket posted high single-digit revenue growth or better year-over-year. This was mainly driven by rig activity, but our performance was also enhanced by key GeoMarket activity exceeding normal seasonal rebounds. The improving exploration trends of last quarter also continued. Wireline offshore exploration revenue grew by a third during the first half of the year with a sizable increase in new technology sales. As offshore momentum builds, shallow-water rig activity grew by 14% in the first half and deepwater activity is strengthening as new projects are sanctioned. Cameron international revenue grew significantly over quarter-over-quarter, supported by leverage of the GeoMarket structure. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where the total Cameron book-to-bill ratio was greater than one. This was also the first quarter since we acquired Cameron, where all four product lines, both long and short cycle grew revenue sequentially. Consolidated revenue in the Latin America area increased 12% sequentially from 21% revenue growth in Mexico & Central America GeoMarket. WesternGeco multi-client seismic sales had a strong quarter as exploration investment continued to gain strength offshore. In the Latin America North GeoMarket, revenue was driven by SPM activity in Ecuador, with the Shaya project continuing to improve from strong execution on waterflooding recovery. Europe/CIS/Africa area consolidated revenue increased 11% over the previous quarter, on the back of seasonal activity recovery in the Northern Hemisphere and rig activity increase in Eastern Europe. In the U.K. & Continental Europe GeoMarket revenue exceeded expectation by growing 28% sequentially, with all product lines experiencing growth. In the Russia & Central Asia GeoMarket, we experienced 12% revenue growth on seasonal recovery with the majority of product lines growing revenue high single-digits or better. Consolidated revenue in the Middle East & Asia area increased 5% sequentially with Far East Asia & Australia GeoMarket leading the way with 19% sequential revenue growth, mostly driven by offshore activity. Elsewhere in the area, the seasonal activity recovery in China was partially offset by lower activity in Malaysia and India. Iraq was lower on completion of IDS project, and in Saudi Arabia, revenue increased on sales of intelligent completions. In the Middle East, the four Cameron product lines delivered double-digit revenue growth driven by increased activity and share gains across the portfolio. As discussed in our last earnings call, we have initiated a systematic process to address underperforming business units and contract in the international markets. I'm pleased to say that more than two-third of our product line experienced sequential revenue growth in the international markets this quarter, and with each of them having expanded their margins. A few business units, however, continue to be highly dilutive to our international margins, and we are looking at their performance very closely. We continue to work with our customers to resolve underperforming contracts, exploring ways to eliminate waste through joint planning or execution or improving terms and conditions to avoid unnecessary cost or excessive risk. Most customers are very receptive to this, as they see the benefit of increased operational performance and are increasingly concerned about securing supply of technology and resource for future activity uptake. These focused efforts are already producing visible improvement in our international margins. As international activity increases, our deployment of CapEx is also prioritized towards business units with higher returns. This dynamic capital deployment is creating some tightness in the market, which is another catalyst for pricing improvements. To conclude, we continue to see high single-digit revenue growth internationally, excluding Cameron consistent with previous guidance. At the close of the first half of 2019, international revenue has increased 8% year-over-year, while North America land revenue has declined 12% year-over-year. These results are in line for our view of the normalization in global E&P spending. And with that, I will turn the call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you Olivier and good morning everyone. I will start by adding a few comments to complement the geographical review of the quarter provided by Olivier and highlight how the current market developments are favorably impacting the opportunity set for Schlumberger. Let me begin with the macro environment where the market sentiments remain balanced. On the demand side, the 2019 agency forecasts have been reduced slightly on global trade fears and current geopolitical tensions, but we do not anticipate any change to the structural demand outlook for the mid-term. On the supply side, we continue to see U.S. shale oil as the only near to medium-term source of global production growth. However, the consolidation among North American E&P companies is further strengthening the shift away from growth focus towards financial discipline, while at the same time driving increased focus on HSE, technology adaptation, more collaborative business models, and it will also potentially dampen the large variations in investment levels throughout the cycle. These effects combined with the recent decision by OPEC and Russia to extend production cuts through the first quarter of 2020, are likely to keep oil prices range bound around present levels. Although the markets are well supplied from projects sanctioned and partly funded prior to 2015, this source of supply additions will start to fade in 2020, thereby further exposing the accelerating decline rates from the mature production basins around the world. In addition, while the number of new FID approvals in 2019 are likely to increase again for the fourth consecutive year; their size and number account for supply additions far below the required production replacement rates. We, therefore, maintain our view that international E&P investment will grow by 7% to 8% in 2019, a figure confirmed by the increasing international rig count and the growth seen in our international business in the first half of this year. In contrast, the cash flow focus amongst the E&P operators confirms our expectations of a 10% decline in North America land investments in 2019. This means the welcome return of a familiar opportunity set for Schlumberger. For the first time since 2012 and 2013, we see high and single-digit growth in the international markets, signaling the start of an overdue and much needed multi-year international growth cycle. This growth is taking place in our backyard, where our technology performance and longstanding presence is highly valued and where our market share and profitability gives us an earnings potential up to four times that of our closest competitor. Our leading international market position is built on our scale, footprint, and extensive technology portfolio, and further strengthened by the significant efforts we have made to evolve the company over the past five years along the following three directions. The first is our internal transformation program that has modernized our workflows and our organizational structure, by creating stronger and more professional support functions with cutting-edge planning, execution, and collaboration tools. This has allowed us to significantly improve the utilization of our asset base and reduce our operating costs through improved planning, distribution, and maintenance. At the same time, we have been able to deploy our people and expertise more effectively. All of this has created structurally lower capital intensity of our traditional product lines and lower working capital throughout our technology offering. This will together improve our ability to generate incremental margins and free cash flow as international activity continues to increase and pricing headwinds gradually become tailwinds. The second major direction we have been pursuing is our digital strategy, which is built on the pillars of a cloud- based applications platform, an open data ecosystem, and a broad range of edge architecture solutions. Altogether, this represents a complete platform ready to support our customers in accelerating the digital transformation of our industry. After years of R&D investments in line with this strategy, we are now introducing several applications to the market, with more to follow in the coming years. Within Reservoir Characterization, we recently introduced the GAIA platform at the EAGE conference in London. GAIA uses the power of DELFI to enable explorationists to discover, visualize, and interact with all available data in a basin without compromising resolution or scale. In Drilling, our OneDrill platform is the first digital drilling system that is fully designed for integration and automation. It spans our drilling software applications, the automation-ready Rig of the Future, and a range of new downhole hardware that together will redefine the efficiency of land drilling operations. And spanning Production and Cameron, our recently announced Sensia joint venture with Rockwell will, upon closure, be the first fully integrated oilfield automation provider focused on production measurement solutions, domain expertise, and automation. The third of our focus areas in recent years has been to reduce the capital intensity of our business after we invested actively to build out the company in the early part of this extended downturn. Our efforts to reduce capital intensity began with our decision to exit the marine seismic business in late 2017, after our advanced geophysical measurement technology failed to deliver the needed financial returns over a number of business cycles and with no improvements in sight. Another recent example is the divestiture of our land drilling rig business in Kuwait, Oman, Iraq, and Pakistan to the Arabian Drilling Company, a minority joint venture we have had with our Saudi Arabian partner TAQA for more than 50 years. Through this transaction, we will eliminate the need for capital investments into this rig fleet, while maintaining access to the rigs for our integrated drilling operations in the Middle East. We will also follow a similar capital structure, but with other partners, for the deployment of the Rig of the Future, where we now have introduced the first rigs into U.S. land. We have also announced our plans to exit the businesses related to Fishing & Remedial services, DRILCO, and Thomas Tools that came with the Smith acquisition in 2010, as these business lines are capital intensive, generate a lower return on capital, and are not core to our drilling operations. Beyond our recently announced transactions, which will produce approximately $1 billion of gross proceeds in 2019, we have also stated our intentions to monetize partly or fully our two SPM projects in Argentina and Canada, to demonstrate our ability to generate value from the assets we take under management. And while we have decided not to undertake new SPM projects that involves any period of negative cash flow, we still see a significant opportunity to deploy the technical and commercial expertise we have developed within SPM through less capital-intensive contractual models. On this basis, we have signed an MOU to work on a large integrated project in the OML 11 block offshore Nigeria, where we will act as the technical and project execution partner, with funding provided by a third party. This SPM-lite project, which involves no Schlumberger capital investment, is our preferred SPM business model going forward. We have also recently entered into a similar SPM-lite project to manage the Awali Field in Bahrain. In addition to the divestitures and the new SPM-lite model, we have also structurally lowered the capital intensity of our core business over the past five years, where we today run our operations with a CapEx requirement of around 5% of revenue compared to historic levels of 10% to 15%. In addition to the major directions I've just described, our day-to-day execution focus continues to be on further improving the quality of service we provide to our customers, optimizing the deployment of our resources, as we start to see shortages in several basins, and to address our underperforming contracts and business units around the world. Altogether, this should enable us to restore profitability to our target levels and also to drive incremental margins and free cash flow going forward. Let me conclude my remarks with a few comments as we transition to a new Chairman and new CEO of Schlumberger. Earlier today, we announced the appointment of Mark Papa as our new Chairman and Olivier Le Peuch as our new CEO. I have spent the past decade as COO, CEO, and more recently as Chairman of Schlumberger, and while it has not necessarily been the friendliest of decades in terms of the business environment, it has been a fantastic journey and a great honor to be trusted with the responsibility to lead this amazing company, which is made up of the best people in our industry. One of the most important duties of a sitting Chairman and CEO is to ensure an orderly succession process to the next leader, which in my mind involves several key responsibilities. The first of these is to pick the right time to step down. After a decade at the top of the company, with the deepest and most challenging downturn in our history behind us, and with the international upturn starting to take shape, I therefore asked our Board to start the succession process exactly 12 months ago. The second responsibility is to fully support the Board as they run the search and selection process for the leadership succession. In this respect, I have provided input to the board on a broad range of topics, including candidate assessments. The third is to support and guide the incoming CEO, as he or she gradually takes over as the new leader of the company, and it has been a pleasure managing side-by-side with Olivier over the past six months. And the last responsibility is, in my mind, to walk off the stage as soon as the successor is ready to take over. This provides the needed freedom and space for the new CEO to drive the changes he or she sees fit, which is the overarching goal of any change in leadership. This is why I recommended to the Board that I do not stay on as Chairman. I will still be attached to the company for a period, ready to be an advisor to Mark and Olivier as required, but beyond that I will step completely into the background. In closing, I would like to thank the entire investment community for the enjoyable and constructive working relationship we have had over the past decade. I would also like to thank my management team you are all amazing and also the Board of Directors, our entire organization, our customers, and our partners for their support. I will in many ways miss being a part of all of this, but it is now time to move on to the next chapter. Thank you, we will now open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning, guys.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.
James West: And Paal congratulations on a 22-year run at Schlumberger including 10 years at the top and the modernization and the transformation of the company, well done, and Olivier congratulations on your appointment as CEO.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
James West: So Olivier, I guess you're up now. So as you take over here from Paal – and Paal I wanted to remember the initiatives that have been underway over his tenure and specifically the last several years during the downturn. Could you perhaps give us somewhat of an outlook or some guidance on how you see your strategy unfolding over the next several years, what are the kind of key points or at least some preview of your strategy? I know you're going to outline that more detail later on this year, but if we can get a preview that'd be great?
Olivier Le Peuch: James, I think you'll understand that my short-term project is clearly to complete first the transition with Paal, and to focus on execution during the upcoming weeks and months as we want to freely reach the opportunity set that this new market outlook presents to us. I will gradually indeed communicate the level of the strategy, during the next few months and quarters as we mature and deploy initially with the leadership team going into 2020. I don't think it's appropriate for me to deploy until at least – prefer to postpone that in a setting and a setup that would be more appropriate. So that could develop and then expose all of you to the right priority range going forward.
James West: Okay. Understood. And then maybe a follow-up, a lot of the recent adjustments within Schlumberger have been to move to a more capital-light structure to drive returns higher. I know Paal outlined several of these recent transactions. Should we expect more of this in the future? Or has the asset base with the business mix and portfolio been cold enough at this point? Or is there more to come?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think for the first I think this is nothing really new. We have started that two or three years ago, and I think we initiated this in larger scale with the WesternGeco transaction about a year or year and half ago. I think we had as part of the management team agreed that we need to look critically at every business we own and look at the return on assets and return on capital and then use a productive approach to anticipate and use every opportunity that exist in the market to either separate or do and run it differently. And I would associate it very closely to two of them the rig deal with ADC in Middle East and – and Sensia as I believe that here it was not necessarily for the asset, but it was more for creating the unique joint venture that would change the market. Why won't we start there? I think it will depend upon the market condition for one; and two, upon the results of some amount of the strategy. But clearly, we will continue to look at every way we can improve our return on the capital return on equity, and improve ROIC for the company. So that's trust – trust me and trust us on this for the future.
James West: Very good. Thanks Olivier.
Operator: And next we go to the line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Good morning, good afternoon, guys.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Angie.
Angie Sedita: Hi. So I echo James' remarks certainly. Congratulations Paal on entering the next chapter of your career and we really enjoyed very much working with you. And your willingness to meet with investors in the Street regularly is appreciated.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Angie.
Angie Sedita: So I think the first question for me is to Olivier or Paal or either one of you both is I think it's really interesting to see that the announcement with Mark Papa as Chairman of the Board. I'm not sure, but is this the first time that a non-exec has been named Chairman for Schlumberger? And it would be helpful to hear the rationale around the decision. Is it corporate governance? Is it a focus on U.S. land markets or the general strength of Papa? And is this a long-term position? Or is this an interim position?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I wouldn't read too much into the details of this. I think the Board is following pretty much the same recipe as when I took over. There was a split of the office Chairman and CEO also when I took over. My predecessor as CEO stayed on a bit longer, but also we had another Nonexecutive Chairman, Tony Isaac staying on for a couple of years after that as the Chairman as well. So the selection is basically down to what the Board has decided. And the split of the office at this stage is the same as what we did when I took over. And what the Board decides to do going forward, I think will be up to the Board.
Angie Sedita: Okay, okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe for Simon, there's been a lot of discussion on free cash flow and the dividend. I'm sure you heard this as well. Maybe you can give us color around the outlook for free cash flow into the second half of 2019. Is it reasonable to think that it could be similar to 2018 levels in the second half or $2.5 billion $2.9 billion I think it was last year and in that context the importance of the dividend and the dividend coverage which is roughly 1.25 time?
Simon Ayat: Okay. Thanks, Angie. Let me just elaborate a bit on the cash. As you noticed in the second quarter, we performed better than last year. We – although, we expected better actually, we were some delays in collection in certain geographical regions. But that put us at six months level at better than last year. We expect the second half to even be better than last year as well. As you know, we always perform during the second – we consume liquidity during the first half, because of working capital, and we improve it during H2 of every year. This year is not going to be an exception. We will continue the trend and you will see that this thing we're very confident on it. Our plans shows that the cash flow in the second half will be quite healthy. And this takes me to this issue of the dividend coverage and return of capital. We obviously -- we haven't been producing enough cash to cover the return on capital but we know that this is a priority. This is an objective and we're comfortable that this level of cash flow free cash flow we will be reached and we will be able to cover our commitment to the return of capital to the shareholders.
Angie Sedita: Okay. And then if I could slip one more in. I mean with Paal's announcement on his resignation it's only natural to think about the CFO succession. While we clearly love you Simon we'd love to hear if there's any background on a heir apparent and just general timing.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would make the bold statement and say that Simon and I will most likely retire at some stage. A date hasn't been set yet and I think the date will be set in between Olivier, Simon, and the Board. And the succession will be carefully planned and we will inform the market when we are ready.
Angie Sedita: Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Operator: And next we go to a question from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good afternoon to you and I'll reiterate the dual congrats to both of you Paal and to you Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Scott.
Scott Gruber: And Olivier I realize its early days but just following up on James' strategy question a question we often get from investors is on OneStim. Is this considered a core for Schlumberger? And how do you think about that business going forward within the portfolio within the context of trying to reduce the capital intensity of the overall portfolio?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, good question Scott. I think first and foremost I think -- to participate into the North America land market is too big to ignore and I believe that our ability to extract value more for our customers to beat a technical challenge and create efficiency for the industry is critical. So that's the reason why I think we have stayed in the market invested in technology takes high value and meet our customer expectation there. Going forward we will reduce the -- look at the way we run this business and look at the optionality going forward of doing it differently. But for now, I think we are in this business to make it the fittest. We have made improvement on efficiency. We are working more across the international operator that are going in the basin also with some large independents. And they are acknowledging our efficiency and the impact we can provide. Now, the future is the future and we will determine on the outlook of the market what is our position and be smart about what we take as a decision and manage the capital allocation accordingly.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And a follow-up on IDS, I was a bit surprised to hear some weakness in the IDS portfolio during the quarter. Can you just discuss what happened in the segment during the quarter? Was this just a speed bump? Is there something more to be concerned about here? And then given the outlook for IDS in the second half how do we think about the outlook for the drilling segment in the second half of the year? I think the original expectation was for overall revenue growth in drilling for the year of around 10% and incrementals of 20% to 25%. How should we think about those two items for the rest of the year?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. Let me first come back onto the Q2 drilling performance as I think two or three things played at the same time. Actually internationally actually LSTK contract with IDS the product line performed very well and had growth internationally and improved their margin. Unfortunately this was offset by the significant activity drop in North America both coming from the breakup and coming from lower rig activity by 5% into the land. Combined with this indeed the total IDS second show was actually lower than in Q1 and this is due to three things; first, Iraq we completed a project. Next, India has an activity that is linked to the project. And last, we had only a flat revenue or flat activity quarter-on-quarter in Saudi. So, Saudi is I think four LSTK contract and we are not necessarily pleased where we are on the performance. But as any project we are focusing on improving quarter-on-quarter performance picking on earnings and trying to improve from this to accelerate the learning curve. This particular commission in Saudi we had geological well condition and operational issue that both combine to create the setback for execution. But I spend quite some time within the team. I've been with the team on the ground and I'm pretty confident that actually the team has understood the gaps both technology and operational execution and that we'll gradually see improvement of our performance in the LSTK contract in Saudi. And in fact converge into the ambition we had which is to reach and be accretive from this execution to the Drilling Group margins.
Scott Gruber: Do you think that margin convergence can happen by the end of the year?
Olivier Le Peuch: I think we will review the progress during the third quarter. I'm planning to stand back and be with the team some time later this quarter to review progress. And then we'll at that time review which or action we take if we are short.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you and congrats again.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hi good afternoon in Paris and Paal I'll go the same path. I really appreciate your accessibility. I know you've done the absolute best you could in a very, very difficult environment. So, kudos to you and look forward to what your next gig is going to be. And Olivier welcome aboard and I look forward to get to know you and work with you. So, kudos on both fronts.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Kurt Hallead: Yes. So, I guess my line of questioning here would maybe focus on some of the operational dynamics. And I was wondering whether Paal or Olivier either one can you speak to the progress that you've made so far on improving the margins on the underperforming international contracts?
Olivier Le Peuch: So, as I've shared during my prepared remarks I think we initiated some key initiatives on the earlier this year to focus on both the contract and the very specific underperforming business unit and not only doing reviews, but also making actions to change the contracts and/or to work with the customer to improve those. So, yes, we have made progress. I think a few business units or contracts that were particularly dilutive have transferred into neutral or accretive during the quarter. And this is visible. As I said, more than two-third of our product line have experienced growth during -- internationally during the quarter and all of them experiencing growth and actually experienced improved margins quarter-on-quarter, which I believe is the first for quite a few quarters. And I think it's due to some of these heightened focus on to these underperforming business units. So now it's not over. We still have a few business units or contracts or execution area where we are not satisfied and I think we have acknowledged this. We have all eyes on this issue and we're working with the team to improve those casually with customers, so that we improve our performance. And continually, we'll gradually improve our margins going forward.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. Appreciate that color. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up question would be, can you give us some general insights on what you see in terms of pricing trends for your drilling-related business lines and frac business lines in the U.S. as well as what you've been experiencing lately for pricing outside North America?
Olivier Le Peuch: So first, starting with North America, I think the pricing is still a little bit depressed environment, both due to the rig activity decline that we have experienced for the last few months combined with the excess capacity that still sits into the North America business. Now this being said, with the right technology, with the right value creation, with the right efficiency, we are capturing either to performance or to technology setup the pricing mix that I think is favorable and we have seen that in our RSS technology in the North America. We have seen that as a motion in Surface MonoFlex. We have seen this into some very specific dedicated fleet contract that we have with OneStim and this help us mitigate the exposure to the spot price market that keeps going down in the market. Now by contrast internationally, while the market is not uplifting the price on the large tender for sure and we still see very much, very highly competitive environment across the globe, we see that in some spot geography with offshore or with in more remote geography with the right technology, be it in exploration or be it in drilling for difficult wells and difficult condition, we are starting to obtain updates and upgrades on our pricing commission or simply getting the mix that is more favorable to our margins. And as such, as I've commented before, several product lines internationally have had a quite robust pull-through in the last quarter.
Kurt Hallead: Thank you. Appreciate that.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Good morning. You expressed basically that you expect the market to remain balanced. When one can make a case, which is shared by I think both EIA and OPEC that non-OPEC supply in certainly 2020 is going to significantly outpace global demand growth. Call on OPEC is going lower and the only thing keeping oil prices where they are is the combination of rational guardianship on the part of Saudi and GCC on the one hand and embargo and quarantined oil in the form of Iran and Venezuela. So walk me through your thesis as to why you think the market stays balanced?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, let me take on that one. So overall, what we're saying is that the balance between demand and supply as we see it today, we don't see it changing dramatically as we go into 2020. The main issue I think around the oil price today is the negative overhang around trade and what the implications of that is going to be for the medium to long-term. So I think in our assumptions, we expect that there will be some type of resolution to this that it's not going to go on for a long time. And that -- with that, we will not have a structural change to the global demand outlook. On the supply side, as I said in my prepared remarks, we see a gradual fall off of the supply additions from the projects that were sanctioned and largely funded prior to 2015 and this will further expose the accelerating decline that we see in the more mature production base. You can look at Norway, U.K., Nigeria, Indonesia, Mexico and so forth and you will see there that even the non-presalt in Brazil, you will see that there is significant declines taking place there. And I think with that, we don't see a major tailwind on non-OPEC production outside the U.S. in 2020. And with also the lower investment that was in the U.S. there will be growth in 2020 in the U.S., but I think it's going to show a decelerating pace. And that's why when you combine all of these things, we believe that the current situation is roughly where we will find ourselves also in 2020.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Well time will tell and I hope you're right. And the second question is with regard to views on the third quarter, if you could talk about that your comfort level with Street estimates et cetera? Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Olivier?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think just to give a little bit of light on this. So we do anticipate a similar earnings step up sequentially during the third quarter. And as such, we believe that the current Street estimates are achievable, however with no visible upside. Indeed, we expect the momentum in international growth and relative margin expansion to continue. That's what we have seen. And we do anticipate also the North America outlook to remain actually challenging as a result of again the sustained pricing pressure and limited or no activity increase partially for drilling. So that in all will result into the guidance I shared.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good afternoon.
Sean Meakim: I wanted to circle back to the dividend. This is something that we discussed when you were at our conference in New York last month, but it seems worth addressing here in this forum, as it's a common investor question. So Olivier, could you maybe speak to your commitment to the dividend as you step into this seat? And Simon, if we could maybe look beyond 2019, could you walk through the levers that are at your disposal to cover the $2 dividend with earnings and cash flow, if we end up in a lower-for-longer scenario in terms of how the macro unfolds?
Olivier Le Peuch: So let me first reiterate what I said indeed to the investor community back in New York is that we are committed and I'm personally committed to dividends. And I will not be the first CEO to step back on this commitment. So count on me and count on the team and the commitment we have into the operating margin improvement and working capital improvement to make it steady and a reality going forward.
Simon Ayat: Okay, let me just repeat a little bit what I said about the cash. Here with the performance that we have achieved the first six months and what we anticipate in the following six months, helped a bit by the divestitures that we have announced we're going to cover everything and overall reduce our net debt slightly but we will, which in other words we will reduce our net debt, which is borrowing and we will be able to cover all the commitment, the dividend and the continued buyback that we are performing on a quarterly basis to avoid the increase in the share count as a result of the stock-based compensation. Now I'm going to go and confirm on our expectations for next year. Next year 2020, our forecast today that the dividend will be covered through the generation of cash from operation. And we will be able to cover the again the dividend and we will continue with this small buy back. So the commitment to dividend as Olivier mentioned and historically there is no question about us maintaining the dividend. And I think given our forecast and what we see the way we're going to conduct the working capital and the investment in the projects we will have ample cash to cover it.
Sean Meakim: Very good. Thank you for that. I think…
Simon Ayat: And on the divestiture, let me finish on the divestiture.
Sean Meakim: Sure.
Simon Ayat: You have three divestitures, which are close to $1 billion. And what we anticipate, what we included in our scenario for this half is at least two of them will be completed in the second half.
Sean Meakim: Thank you for that. I think that will be well received. We haven't spoken on Cameron yet. And so I was hoping to get a little more of the outlook there maybe a confirmation from your perspective that we've hit a trough in the margin in the first half of the year perhaps in the first quarter. In the release there were some nice contract wins with Chevron and Shell I noticed. How do you view -- how do you market share in subsea and perhaps in pricing as well as integrated projects are becoming a bigger part of the demand mix there?
Olivier Le Peuch: Good question. Thanks. I see first that Cameron Group continued to perform very well. I think I've seen that the long-cycle business continued to increase backlog. Now, we're in excess of $2.7 billion, mostly from subsea. And the short cycle as well is continuing to maintain share in North America and gaining share internationally. So you're seeing that mix including share internationally for the short cycle and maintaining share and rebounding from the activity. Long-cycle rebound is combining to help us with not only growth but also with margin improvement over the period. So I think the margin, yes, I think we have made that comment that we believe the margin trough is behind us, and I believe that this is roughly the case. And I think we are -- we see going forward steady growth build on the backlog that the long cycle have accumulated and build on the further gain on the international growth. As you have seen international growth was across the core product line in Q2 sequentially. We expect this to continue in the second half and this is built on the leverage of the GeoMarkets contracts that have started to take place and is giving a tailwind to the Cameron organization. Now more specific to subsea, I'm very pleased with the engagement and the relationship and the alliance we have with Subsea 7. We have actually in connection with this, we have received the required anti-trust clearance and as such we have accelerated elevating alliance to now having a dedicated management -- joint management structure that oversees not only the engineering, but also the pursuit of new opportunity and integrated project and the execution of project during integration. The result, of which I think you, may have seen it. We are quite successful in the last few quarter to gain against competition integrated joint project and I think the feedback that I've received personally from the customer and that Jean Cahuzac and his team have received from the customer is excellent both from the execution, but also as we presented one team to the customer we also offer them the optionality to choose us independently and go with either self-package or the SVF package. So I am confident that this integration will continue to be a success for both company and I'm very confident that with regards to OneSubsea, the leadership there on the tieback compression and execution target goal they have they are the execution company in subsea to what I've seen. They have technology edge on subsea processing including compression. And you have seen the recent award from Shell, Ormen Lange in Norway, again a major award that cements our leadership into subsea processing system that have the reliability and deliver the recovery that the customer wants. So very well aligned and I'm confident.
Sean Meakim: Very interesting. Thanks, Olivier.
Operator: And our next question is from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Dave Anderson: Hi, good morning Olivier. Just a question on the offshore side. I think you had said in your remarks that your shallow water business was up 40% on the first half of the year, year-over-year. I was also really more curious with the deepwater side. Floating rig count is up 20 rigs or so this -- beginning of this year, see more FID exploration activity. Is this lining up for an inflection in the deepwater part of the market, which is so important to the Schlumberger business? Is that a 2020 event? Is it too early to tell? Can you just help us understand how the deepwater market is framing up for you?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yeah, thank you first for correcting the number. Maybe I misspelled it, but it was 14% -- one-four -- percent shallow water rig activity that is continued growth. The deepwater is seeing less growth of rig activity at the moment more single digit, yet we are seeing FID -- there is color on FID that are lining up in the third and fourth quarter of this year that would translate in further growth and acceleration of deepwater as we expect into next year. Now the offshore activity at large I think is very solid on shallow both in Middle East and in Asia. And deepwater is seeing the rebound of activity in the West Africa at large. So I feel a combination of this is very favorable. As I did comment in my prepared remark, the offshore exploration is up more than 30% year-over-year year-to-date and this benefits very much Wireline. So the deepwater activity is more later-cycle increase that we'll see from the second half and into next year.
Dave Anderson: Great, thank you. A completely different subject. North America I'm sure you're getting bombarded with the talk of E&P capital discipline like everybody else is. What -- and I know you don't know exactly how the year is going to play out but fourth quarter activity looks like it could happen similar to last year. Is that how you're preparing your business right now for sort of the cadence of spending in North America to look similar to last year? And if so, what does that mean? Does that mean that you're prepared to stack more equipment? How do you prepare your business for that type of market, which could potentially fall from the back part of the year?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, you are correct. That's the assumption that we're also taking. I think, we do expect and anticipate that the combination of seasonal slowdown and budget exhaustion will create a trough in the fourth quarter as we have experienced last year, but will be followed most likely by our strengthening and rebound activity in Q1 across the area. So, we are prepared for this. We have done it last year. We'll be agile. We'll be certainly stacking some equipment. We'll be going and doing what is necessary to withstand this trough, but we are ready for it. I think agility is, one of the focus of the team, both in organization and into responding to the market trough and peak. So, we will do that again this year.
Dave Anderson: Great. Thank you, Olivier. We look forward to hearing from you later this year on your broader strategy. Thank you.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll go to a question from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. This is our last question. Please go ahead.
Jud Bailey: All right. Thanks and good afternoon to you guys. First of all Paal, it has been good working with you over the years and good luck on the next chapter for you. And Olivier, I'll tell you also congratulations to you as well.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Jud Bailey: Yes. My question I guess Olivier, just thinking a little bit bigger picture on North America, kind of given the outlook that looks like the U.S. market definitely needed to grow for maybe the next couple of years. How are you thinking about getting margins higher in that business? You kind of talked a little bit about OneStim a little while ago, but what about just North America more broadly? How do you drive better margins in that business and in this market where year-over-year you're maybe flat, but you're also having to navigate through pretty severe seasonal swings as well quarter-to-quarter?
Olivier Le Peuch: No, that's a challenge that we all face and I think the way, we are addressing this is twofold. First, focus on our own quality control which is our own efficiencies and our own productivity. And I think, we have deployed several parts of business system deep-hole tools and technology that improve our own surface efficiency that improve the way we operate, deploy equipment and run remote operation in the North American basin. And that has over time proven to be following through and helping to protect our margins. Now, the second aspect is, reservoir efficiency for addressing the gap of technology that the customer looking for to address some technical challenge and the specifics of parent-child interference and all the specific performance contract that some of the major are ready to engage with us with. So, playing on both, continuing our execution on productivity, efficiency and modernization, which has already gained a lot of pull-through and aligning more with some critical customers partly around the technical challenge or around when we can, like we did with Oxy and Aventine, New Mexico around performance-based contracts and then using -- leveraging our system performance to extract the margin. Both these will be played one to protect our cost structure and to be more productive and the other one to uplift and capture some of the value we focus on that. So this will protect and increase our margin going forward.
Jud Bailey: Okay. All right. I appreciate that. My follow-up is on the third quarter commentary. I think, I believe you said you're comfortable with where consensus is and I wonder just to understand a little bit better, does that envision like a recovery or a little bit better margin trajectory from the drilling business which stepped down this quarter, took the hit to third quarter consensus? Do you envision that your drilling margins are probably more in line with where you would've expected earlier in the year? Just help us think about margin progression and how you're feeling about that and the various segments?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes absolutely. I think the mix will be a little bit different, albeit similar trajectory for international. I will expect that some of the setback we had in the second quarter will resolve themselves and the activity mix will present itself opportunity for drilling to perform slightly better next quarter.
Jud Bailey: Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll go back.
Olivier Le Peuch: So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. So before we end today's call, I would like to do first few closing comments. Firstly, I want to reiterate my word of appreciation to all the Schlumberger employees, who did contribute to last quarter's success. Our performance -- second quarter performance was both solid on earnings and cash flow generation on the back of a broad international and offshore market recovery, partially offset by the persistent challenge in North America land market. We did respond very well to this familiar setting, leveraging our international footprint, our technological strength and our efficiency and performance execution with most of product lines and geography posting material revenue growth quarter-on-quarter. Our elevated focus on service quality and low performing business units and strict prioritization of capital allocation have also resulted in margins improvement internationally. Additionally, we are working closely with our customers to extract more performance on single contract and we are jointly planning the mobilization of the upcoming activities in response to the increased concern about future supply of resource and technology. Looking forward, despite the fears of global trade and geopolitical tensions, the current activity trends looks set to continue with -- into the second half of the year with the next quarter driven by strengthening activity and increasing international spend, whereas we anticipate the North America land market to provide no relief from pricing pressure and little or no income or productivity. We believe that this market conditions continue to align very well with our positional strength, particularly on our ability to generate much differentiated earning potential and we expect that the momentum initiated during the second quarter to continue during the remainder of the year. Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Paal for his support and guidance during the past six months, while recognizing the contribution he has made to the company for the last decade. I had the privilege to work side by side with Paal during most of the last 10 years and I've been very impressed by his unique leadership skills and his ability to steadily transform the company in a very difficult period and propel Schlumberger for future success at the lead of a new growth cycle internationally. I believe in particular that the modernization platform and the digital technology leadership developed during the last few years will represent a winning foundation upon which we will develop our next chapter with an increased focus on cash and returns. I look forward to continuing the engagement with the investor community during the quarter and look forward to see many of you during the energy conference early September. Thank you for your attention and participation to this call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-18 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2019 earnings call. Today's call is being hosted from Quito, Ecuador, following the Schlumberger Limited Board Meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Olivier Le Peuch, newly appointed Chief Operating Officer. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we'll open up for questions. For today's agenda, Simon will first present comments on our first quarter financial performance, before Olivier reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro. However, before we begin, I'd like to remind our participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll hand the call over to Simon Ayat.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share was $0.30, excluding charges and credits, this represents a decrease of $0.06 sequentially and $0.08 when compared to the same quarter last year. There were no charges or the credit recorded during this quarter. Our first quarter revenue of $7.9 billion decreased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonal declines. Pre-tax operating margin decreased by 30 basis points to 11.5%. Highlights by broad product group were as follows: First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 7% sequentially, due to a seasonal decline in Wireline activities, primarily in Russia and lower SIS software and multiclient license sales, following their traditionally strong fourth quarter performance. Margin decreased 308 basis points to 19%, due to the lower contribution from Wireline, SIS and multiclient. Drilling Group revenue of $2.4 billion decreased 3% sequentially, driven by seasonally lower drilling activity in the international area. Margins were essentially flat at 12.9%. Production Group revenue of $2.9 billion, decreased 2% sequentially, due to a decline in OneStim revenue in North America land. Margins improved slightly by 76 basis points to 7.5%. Cameron Group revenue of $1.2 billion, decreased 7% sequentially, this decrease was primarily due to lower project volumes and reduced product sales of long cycle businesses of OneSubsea and Drilling Systems. Lower Surface System revenue also contributed to the decline. Despite the revenue declines margin increase were 161 basis points to 11.6%, driven by improved profitability in Drilling Systems and Valves & Measurements. The book-to-bill ratio for Cameron long-cycle business was 1.5 in Q1. The OneSubsea backlog increased to $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 15.5% in the first quarter, this was essentially flat with the previous quarter. Our corporate and other expense line item increased sequentially by $35 million to $273 million in Q1. This increase was largely attributable to certain exceptional accounting for stock-based compensation costs in the quarter. In the second quarter, we expect these costs to return to a level more in line with where we were in Q4. We just recently completed a very successful debt exchange offer. As a result, we issued $1.5 billion of notes due in 2028, that bear interest at 3.9%. These new notes were exchanged for a similar amount of notes that were scheduled to be repaid in 2022 and 2025. This debt exchange, combined with other refinancing activities, we completed during the quarter, serves to improve our debt maturity profile going forward. As a result, the net interest expense at the corporate level is expected to increase by approximately $10 million to $15 million next quarter. We generated $326 million of cash flow from operations during the first quarter. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experienced during the first quarter, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation. Our inventory levels also increased in anticipation of higher activity levels in the coming quarters. Our net debt increased $1.1 billion during the quarter to $14.4 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we spent $98 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares at an average price of $42.79. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $413 million and capitalized costs relating to SPM projects of $151 million. During the quarter, we also made $692 million of dividend payment. Full year 2019 CapEx excluding SPM and multiclient investments is still expected to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. And now, I will turn the conference call over to Olivier.
Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Simon, and good morning everyone. I'm very pleased to be here today, mind you all to give you an update on our global operation. I would like to start with our international business, with Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production combining to deliver year-on-year revenue growth of 8% for the first quarter of 2019. This year-over-year increase was led by Latin America, Africa and Asia where we continue to see a ramp-up in activity, supporting our expectations of high single-digit international revenue growth for the year. My comments on geographies will exclude Cameron, which I will discuss separately. In Latin America, revenue increased 7% sequentially driven by strong growth in the Mexico & Central America GeoMarket, which posted nearly 50% year-over-year revenue growth. This was driven by high offshore exploration-related activity for the international operators, multiclient seismic sales and intensifying onshore IDS work for PEMEX. In the Latin America and the offshore market, revenue increased from higher SPM activity together with increased production from the Shaya field in Ecuador where over the course of last year, we have ramped-up the water injection program. We're extremely pleased with the progress of this SPM project as it does position the Shaya field as a top oil-producing field in Ecuador. In Argentina, revenue increased slightly from full efficiency of hydraulic fracturing and SPM activity. On the SPM shale oil pilot in Bandurria Sur block, the return has been reduced by 20% in the first year of activity, and four of our new wells ranked within the top 10 producer of oil wells drilled in Latin America. Impressive results much to the credit of the integrated approach and application of the reservoir domain knowledge and finally, the deployment of new technology. Seasonal activity slowdowns in Europe, CIS and Africa decreased revenue 5% sequentially, primarily in Russia and Central Asia. Lower seasonal activity in the North Sea was compounded by weather and [bank notes] [ph] related delays. This was partially offset by the very successful start-up of an IBS project in Turkey and strong coiled tubing activity in Ukraine. Revenue in Sub-Sahara Africa were slightly lower sequentially, due to reduced product sales in Mozambique and Angola. Despite this, the Sub-Sahara Africa GeoMarket increased revenue 30% year-over-year from increasing activity on exploration projects, [indiscernible] new technology uptake and multiclient seismic licensing. The revenue in the Middle East & Asia decreased 4% sequentially; IBS project activity across the area continues to grow. LSTK projects in Saudi Arabia are progressing with the first full quarter of drilling from all the 25 rigs mobilized last year. During the quarter, we drilled no less than 30 wells equivalent to 1/3 of the total number of wells drilled last year. These projects are moving up the revenue curve with improved efficiency and new technology deployments. However, some are currently derivatives to our margins. The Saudi Arabia results were also affected by unusual flooding that delayed WesternGeco land seismic operations. In Southeast Asia GeoMarket, India revenue increased also on higher IDS activity. The Far East Asia experienced a sequential revenue decrease with activity slowdown in Australia due to cyclone season. This was offset partially by operation in China, which performed better than expected due to milder winter weather conditions. Overall, Far East Asia and Australia GeoMarket showed strong year-over-year revenue growth of 27%. Now let us turn to North America. Our first quarter revenue in North America was 4% lower on the sequential basis, excluding Cameron, from the combination of lower overall activity and weaker pricing for both our hydraulic fracturing and drilling-related business while our artificial lift revenue was flat. Although hydraulic fracturing stage counts in North America land increased nearly 5% sequentially largely from the Western Canada retail rampart, such that pricing pushed overall revenue sequentially lower. However, if we look closer into our OneStim operation, we can see that effective cost management and operational agility have supported productions margin. Late last year as the WTI oil price collapsed, we won stock half fleet and accelerated in Q4 tendering season to bridge the year-end activity decline. The ready program of these fleets under our new contracts during January combined with our vertically integrated supply chain, operational efficiency and cost control effectively protected margins. Pricing, however, remains depressed, we believe, that visibility into the second half of the year. Our course for frac fleet deployment this year is operational flexibility focused on improving returns and cash generation. North America offshore revenue was flat sequentially with increased Wireline activity in the Gulf offset by lower multiclient seismic sales. As an example, I would like to highlight the deepwater project for our customer in the Gulf of Mexico where we have significantly reduced drilling and well construction time using new technology and a collaborative business model. This project resulted in six of the most complex wells ever drilled in the reducing operational costs by over 40% and accelerating project execution by eight months. Hence, generating significant value for our customer. As the offshore development and exploration market gradually recover, we'll focus on deploying new technology that impact the operational performance for the benefit of our customers. Finally, I would like to discuss the results of Cameron. Cameron revenue was down sequentially following the usual strong year-end sales. The sequential decline in revenue was 7%, most of which was in international markets, offset partially by a sequential increase in North America. With this backlog, we continue to see the trend of strong OneSubsea bookings that began in the second half of last year, tipping the book-to-bill ratio materially above one. This bookings included one major multiphase boosting solution highlighting the success of this technology for short- cycle offshore projects, particularly with tiebacks. Together with our partner Subsea 7, we are also awarded two multiclient projects during last quarter. We are very pleased with the progress of the Subsea Integration Alliance and continue to receive excellent feedback from our customers on project under joint execution. Cameron Surface Systems revenue declined in lower activity in Australia and Southeast Asia bookings were up slightly year-over-year. Short-term growth is currently driven by the uptake of wellhead technology and frac services for North America land and Argentina customers. Cameron Drilling Systems declined sequentially following strong product and sales delivery during the fourth quarter in North America. By contrast, Wireline measurements revenue was up on strong demand from distributors, stocking inventory to support upcoming completion activity and the continued upstream infrastructure build-out of Permian takeaway capacity. The Cameron Group margins did increase sequentially in Q1 2019 to improve project execution and pull- through from the North America product sales. We did comment earlier that the trough of the cycle for both Cameron revenue and margins will have ended in the first half of 2019. I believe that the current momentum in margin recovery and book-to-bill ratio will continue as well in the right path. To conclude, we have started the year on a very positive note with 10 of the 16 GeoMarkets showing double-digits year-on-year revenue growth. Some of these were GeoMarkets that had experienced the greatest revenue compression. They are now seeing stronger active trends that support our high single-digit revenue growth outlook for our international market this year. And with that, I will turn the call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Olivier. Following the review of the Cameron Group results, let me next comment on the first quarter performance of the Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups. In Reservoir Characterization, our Wireline business recorded a year-over-year increase in exploration-related revenue of 17% in the first quarter. That's below the total of 105 offshore exploration wells, which is 40% higher than the first quarter of last year. New technology sales in Wireline were also up significantly, reaching 31% of total revenue, driven by our newly introduced reservoir fluid sampling and pressure measurement services, which are essential to reservoir description in both exploration and development wells. In other exploration- related activities, multiclient seismic sales remain solid in the first quarter, while they also showed solid year-over-year growth in Testing Services, and we expect our exploration-related product lines to continue to build momentum over the course of this year. In the Drilling Group, new technology sales were again strong, driven by Drilling & Measurements where we, in the first quarter posted a 50% year-over-year increase in footage drilled for our latest generation or rotary steerable technologies. We also recorded 20% year-over-year growth in footage drilled for our total rotary steerable systems offering, which now comprises five customized technology solutions that effectively cover all our key markets around the world, with particular focus on the Middle East, the North Sea, the Permian and DJ basins in the U.S. land, and the Szechuan and Tarim basins in China. Still the largest contributor to the 12% increase in year-over-year revenue growth for the Drilling Group was our integrated Drilling Services projects. At present, all the rigs we deployed in 2018 are now fully operational and steadily advancing of the learning and performance curve in our various projects. In the first quarter, we saw a very strong performance improvements in our IDS projects in Latin America, while in the Middle East & Asia challenging drilling conditions on some projects partly offset solid efficiency improvements on others. Still we have clearly established technology and process improvement plans for all our integrated drilling projects, and we expect our IDS product to be accreted to Drilling Group margins, by the time we exit 2019. In the Production Group, we have over the past four years significantly built out our technology offering and our presence in the global production market, and through that further expanded the growth platform for Schlumberger going forward. This includes our artificial lift and coiled tubing businesses, where we today are global market leaders, completion products where we, in addition to our leadership position in the high-end market, continued to build out our land offering through organic R&D investments; and hydraulic fracturing, where we are now have established the needed scale and execution expertise to effectively compete in the North America land market. Our focus going forward for the Production Group is now to deliver improved financial returns in all parts of our global operations, after having completed our multiyear investment program. We will do that by reaping the benefits of our modernized operating platform and by deploying a rich set of new technologies that drive cost efficiency and quality for both our operations and for our customers. In line with this focus, we are pleased with the first quarter sequential margin performance in the Production Group. And we expect to see continued progress in both operating margins and earnings contribution from our production-related businesses going forward. As we continue to build the top line growth momentum in our overall international business, we are not also actively deploying our well-defined playbook focused on increasing incremental margins. Looking closer at our first quarter results. Around half of our international legacy revenue is already producing highly creative year-over-year incremental margins, driven by new technologies sales, solid contractual terms and conditions, higher volume of activity and the benefits from our internal modernization program, while still excluding any material price book increases. Around 1/3 of our international legacy revenue is dealing moderately accretive incremental margins, impacted by lower base pricing and so far less scale and efficiency benefits, while the last quarter of our international legacy revenue is at present highly dilutive to both current and incremental operating margins, due to low pricing on favorable contractual terms and lack of critical mass. At present, this remains the most noticeable headwind to our international financial performance. Granted, we have over the past few years knowingly decided to enter into these contracts in order to protect our geographical footprints and provide future business opportunities and optionality. Still, most of these low return contracts are callout based, which means there is no firm scope offered from our customers, and we are, hence, free to respond to their callout requests, based on our available capacity, which today is already stretched. As for capital deployment, we maintain our CapEx guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion for 2019, with our CapEx deployment being entirely focused on the half of our international revenue that is already yielding the required incremental margins. For the other half of our international business, our near-term priority is to engage with our customers to establish pricing, contractual terms and a work scope that will provide us with the opportunity to quickly establish the needed financial returns. As part of this process, we will look to high-grade our contract base as needed and potentially redeploy existing capacity to contracts and customers who offers higher profitability until operating and incremental margins also have reached the required levels. Only at that stage will we consider deploying fresh capital into this part of our international business. Turning lastly to the industry macro where we continue to expect oil market sentiments to steadily improve over the course of 2019. Our view is backed by a solid demand outlook, the full effects of the OPEC and Russian production cuts, the slowing shale oil production growth in North America and the further weakening of the international production base as the impact of four years of underinvestment becomes increasingly evident. The recent strength in the price of crude oil, with Brent again breaking through the $70 per barrel level, is supporting this outlook. We also see clear signs that E&P investment sentiments are starting to normalize as the industry heads towards a more sustainable financial stewardship of the global resource base. Directionally, this means higher investments in the international markets simply to keep production flat, while North America land activity is set for lower investments with a likely downward adjustment to the current production growth outlook. In the international markets outside the Middle East and Russia, the inevitable production decline resulting from the record-low investment levels seen in the past four years is now becoming increasingly visible. First quarter oil production in the international markets outside OPEC was down 400,000 barrels a day versus Q1 of 2018 and 900,000 barrels a day versus Q1 of 2017. While the underlying decline in the aging production base in key oil-producing countries such as Norway, UK, Brazil and Nigeria has so far been offset by new project start-ups, the need for a stronger supply side response is becoming increasingly evident. Strong new investments are also needed in countries like Mexico, Angola, Indonesia and China where total production has been in noticeable decline for several years. Within this industry backdrop, we continue to execute our plans for 2019, targeting high single-digit international revenue growth with a business focus and capital deployment strategy as I have already outlined. Looking at the first quarter, the growth in the international rig count, both on land and in particular offshore, the rise in the number of new project FIDs and Subsea 3 awards and a renewed interest in exploration is all supporting our outlook. Conversely, in North America land, the higher cost of capital, lower borrowing capacity and investors looking for increased returns suggest that future E&P investments will likely be at levels dictated by free cash flow. We, therefore, see land E&P investment in North America down 10% in 2019. In addition to the lower investments, increasing technical challenges from well interference, step out from core acreage and limited further growth in lateral length and proppant per stage, points to a more moderate growth rate in the U.S. shale oil production in the coming years. The normalization of global E&P spending with increased international market investments and a reduction in North America land CapEx represents a positive market shift for Schlumberger and we welcome the return of a very familiar opportunity set given our unmatched global strength. With the efforts in investments we have made in recent years to modernize our execution platform, expand our technology offering, drive digital and technology system innovation, evolve our business models and strengthen our global footprint, we are better positioned than ever to capitalize on the opportunity set we now have in front of us, which at present is the overriding goal of the entire Schlumberger organization. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you very much. We will now open up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Thanks. Good morning, Paal and Olivier.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, James.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
James West: So Paal, it appears you've got the Board down in Latin America, in Quito right now. I'm curious similar to when you've held Board meetings in Saudi and Moscow and other places, there's usually a build up to the actual meeting, a lot of stuff that you guys do and see and talk about on the operational side. Could you maybe give us some color on what the Board saw, what you guys did this week in Quito or broader Latin America?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. Thanks James. So as you know, as you said, we always conduct our April Board meeting in one of our operating R&D locations. Last year, we were in Silicon Valley. And in previous years, as you referenced, we've been in Saudi and Moscow. So this year, we picked Ecuador mainly because we have a big operation here. We have three major SPM projects, which we review regularly with the Board. So part of the objective of our meeting in Ecuador this week is for the Board to see the projects up close and also meet the great people we have on the ground here, both executing these projects and also supporting the rest of our operations in Ecuador and in Latin America North. Now in addition to this, we also have an excellent working relationship with the Ecuadorian state oil company, Petro Amazonas, as well as the key ministries. So part of the purpose of this week's visit as well is to reinforce our commitment, strong ties to Ecuador and have the Board meet some of the key external stakeholders. So we are spending a couple of days in Quito concluding the Board meeting. Then we're also going to the field to give the Board a firsthand look at some of our operations. So this is in line with what we do in the April Board meeting.
James West: Got you. Okay, thanks. And then Paal, you talked about in the press release and in your prepared comments about higher returns. We did notice a change – some changes to the proxy as it came out. And how was Schlumberger – how are you guys thinking about focusing on driving higher returns as the industry gets back to more normalized spending patterns?
Paal Kibsgaard: So, I mean, if you look at the focus we have as a company, today, growing the top line is obviously the key to all that what we do. But beyond that, getting our return on capital employed and our operating margins back up to the levels we had in 2014 is a key objective. Higher revenue is going to be part of it. But beyond that, it is being very prudent in how we deploy capital and also how we manage costs in the operation as we now start to grow. And beyond that, we will also need to get some of our pricing concessions back in order to drive profitability. So we have a very comprehensive playbook and focus on this to drive all these aspects of returns in addition to the cash flow, which we are in the midst of deploying and focusing on in 2019. It is reflected in the objectives of the senior management team and also in the day-to-day activity of what we do.
James West: Okay, perfect. Thanks Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks James.
Operator: Next we go to line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Angie.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Angie Sedita: Nice to see a solid quarter here. So maybe, Paal, we can go into your comments that you made on the international market as well as what was in the press release and give us a little bit of color and maybe specifics around your visibility for high single, double-digit revenue growth in international markets and maybe in the context of normalized spending, exploration spending and the technology take up.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, thanks Angie. So I would say high-level summary, the year has started off, internationally, pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So we have indicated high single-digit revenue growth for us internationally. And with the 8% we posted in Q1, I think we are pretty much in line with that outlook. The key driver for this year-over-year growth is offshore, in particular shallow water. We've seen about a 20% increase in shallow water rig count year-over-year Q1 to Q1, which is obviously very good for us. We still have a very strong position in these markets. But in addition to this, we're also seeing a renewed focus on offshore exploration. I referenced some of the Wireline information that obviously is a key proxy for how we do in offshore exploration. So this is also very good news. Where we see the revenue growth coming, it is going to still be from the areas where we have had the highest revenue compression like Latin America, Africa and Asia. But also in the North Sea, Russia and the Middle East, we expect to see solid revenue growth off a large revenue base in these areas, right. So what’s going to drive the year is offshore and with some increased focus that we see on exploration as well. And what's driving the offshore, I think, is there's a rich opportunity set around short cycle projects. And we also see now that the number of FIDs is increasing fairly rapidly. There was about 50 offshore FIDs last year, and we see now, on the horizon, about 80 of this year. And these are not only step outs and brownfield kind of upgrades. This is also greenfield activity. So I think we have a fairly reasonable visibility on the year. And so far, it shaped up pretty much in line with what we were expecting.
Angie Sedita: Okay, that’s very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, two items, is do you think that we're going to see a shift? You talked about shallow water 20% growth year-over-year. Do you think we're going to see a shift as we go into 2019 and 2020 to more deepwater? And then can you also touch on the confidence around pricing opportunities around the world, both land and offshore internationally?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I think it's a bit early to kind of make those, I would say, projections on deepwater. We are seeing some increase in deepwater exploration but I would say that the 2019 will be shallow water. And I think as that continues to mature, I expect that we will see more on deepwater in 2020 and beyond.
Operator: And we will move on to a question from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: So I want to follow on Angie's question and stay on the international side, looking at the growth potential. I'm really curious about how you see long-term growth shaping up. So if we paint a scenario and take a look at the forward curve, and the crude stays around the $65 to $70 level on Brent how many years of reasonable growth, call it, mid single-digit can be reasonably expected as reinvestment rates normalize, and I'm assuming no major change in crude?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think if you look at where investment levels were back in the period, 2010 to 2014, obviously internationally now we are still almost around half of those investment levels. And if you were to say that the new normal is somewhere in between where we are and where we used to be, you still need multiple years of not even single-digit but probably double-digit growth in order to get back to the – even the halfway point between investment levels in 2014 and investment levels as of today. So we still see a fairly decent runway for increased international investments. And you also see the need for this in the production declines that we are now seeing in the mature production base internationally.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And you guys did a great job on margin performance in the first quarter, and I appreciate all the color on margins and the drivers of margins going forward this year. Can you just provide some color on the impact on incrementals going forward? Consensus says sub-30% incrementals in 2Q, and then moving to the high 30% incrementals in the second half of the year. Is it reasonable to expect incremental improvement of that order of magnitude in the second half could be better on some of the job mix and exploration and some of the start-up costs fading? Could you actually see incrementals above 40% in the second half of the year?
Paal Kibsgaard: That’s a good question. Olivier, you want to comment?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, thank you. So indeed, I think it's good to see that our top line sales is increasing in international market, and the mix is improving towards more offshore and more exploration. So that is certainly a play that is good and alarming for our strengths. This being said, I think the pricing environment internationally is still depressed compared to where we were and used to have in two or three or five years ago. And as Paal did comment, about half of our revenue is, indeed, getting a pull-through that is accretive to our margin and certainly in the expected pull-through that we have anticipated. But we still have one quarter of revenue base that is changed based on contract condition, based on execution and based on pricing constraints that we have, highly competitive environments that is challenging us to add a full mix, that is accretive as we could hope. So we are resolute to fix and to focus on this quarter revenue that is not building the right margins. And we are hoping that this mix, with the increase offshore, increased exploration will gradually improve our pull-through for the coming quarters, but I would not expect this to be a step change compared to what we have seen in the last two quarters.
Scott Gruber: Got it, appreciate the color.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Sean Meakim with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Thank you, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Sean Meakim: I thought I'd ask a little more on Cameron. The business showed a really good order rate in the first quarter after a nice pickup in the second half of last year. I think it's maybe one of the best quarters for the industry in terms of awards that I can remember. Could you maybe give us a little more forward detail on the outlook for orders for the balance of the year, maybe a mix of small versus large opportunities and your confidence in a bottom here by the middle of the year in terms of the P&L?
Paal Kibsgaard: Olivier, you want to comment?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes, thank you. Good question on Cameron. So as I did comment in my prepared remark, we do see, indeed, a gradual improvement of our book-to-bill ratio, the bookings parting subsea is supported by the shift to a more FID, offshore FID. The pipeline of offshore FID is increasing. As Paal did comment earlier from 50 last year, the pipeline is in excess of 80 this year. So we do expect that the Subsea 3 this year will be north of 300, similar to what we have last year. So that will fall-through into a set of bookings for integrated project or nonintegrated. So we believe that the Subsea will maintain its book-to-bill full year ratio materially above one. This will include some step outs infield with existing customer, and this will include integrated new field – larger greenfield project like the two that we have won recently with Woodside, one of which for gas development in Senegal. So we believe that the outlook is strong on the back of Subsea. With regards to drilling system, I think that this is a bit different as it is still a market where we benefited last year from quite a large set of land rig equipment and BOP take up, combined with mobilization and remobilization of deepwater rigs that we're preparing for the offshore companies. This will certainly change a bit going forward. But our land rig equipment will increase further as we step going forward. So I believe that the outlook is strong. Book-to-bill ratio above one for the remainder of the year and aligned with the subsea offshore development and, to a lesser extent, with the further mobilization of rig and the land activity being steady.
Sean Meakim: Great, Olivier for all that detail. Thinking about also the cash flow in the quarter, some of it to rely on the detail and the working capital swing was as expected. But perhaps we could just come back to your confidence level in terms of free cash flow for the year at or above 2018 levels. I think that's been the expectation that you set out there. And looking beyond free cash, beyond the SPM divestitures that you're working towards, are there any other noncore asset sales that could be contemplated? I'm thinking of that – a little bit in the context of Sensia JV and the SPM process that you've laid out.
Paal Kibsgaard: Simon, you want to comment?
Simon Ayat: Sure. Look, in summary, if you look at the working capital deterioration beyond what we used to see in Q1, it's basically two things: pockets of delays in receivable collection, which is not very big, but it's already sorted out itself in the second quarter; and the other one is the build of inventory, which we experienced normally in Q1, and it was higher because what you heard about Cameron book-to-bill and the preparation for the projects to come. So that's in summary, right. Normally, free cash flow in the first quarter, we struggle to keep it even because of the seasonality. Now as far as the total year is concerned, we're very confident on the free cash flow. We – as we already reported or declared that we will satisfy all our commitments from the cash that we will generate, and it's still the case. Actually, as I see it, is it's slightly improving as we go with our outlook. Now you spoke about some divestitures. There are divestitures in the pipeline. We're working on them, but there is nothing concrete to tell you about the timing. But it is certainly, it will be a positive, and we're keeping this for – further the growth of the business or anything else. As far as Sensia is concerned, Sensia, we signed it. We will hopefully close before – by the latest by Q3, and there is about $250 million of this will be coming as part of the valuation and the split within the joint venture.
Sean Meakim: Great, thank you for that.
Operator: Next we will move on to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Good morning, everyone.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Olivier Le Peuch: Good morning.
Kurt Hallead: So Paal, lot of emphasis rightly so on the international market. So I might want to maybe shift to Q&A and you mentioned what's going on in North America and activity level being down 10%. It sounds like that's maybe at the lower end of what you had previously discussed. So I was wondering if you could just give us some insights. Are you getting any better visibility now that oil prices have been higher than what these E&P companies had been budgeting for? And can you give us an update? I think you idled a couple of frac crews during the course of the fourth quarter and whether or not there's been sufficient enough activity now to kind of bring those crews back in. And generally maybe just – you talked about potential for pricing improvement internationally, so could you give us similar kind of context around pricing dynamics in the North America market?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, okay. So I will say, first of all, we see a fairly consistent discipline from the customer base at this stage around living within or at least much closer to their free cash flow. This, I think, is partly driven by the management teams as well as from the investors side. So with that, that's really what's driving our prediction of about 10% down in the E&P investments in North America land. As we go forward into the full year, visibility for the second half of the year is still fairly limited. For Q2, we are expecting the number of frac stages to go up, but a fair bit of that activity increase is going to be offset by the full impacts of the pricing concessions that we gave in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We do expect hydraulic fracturing pricing to stabilize in terms of the bid pricing in the second quarter. Now how this is going to evolve for the second half of the year, lack of visibility, I think, is still the case. I don't think though at this stage, that if we have a further run up of the oil price we're going to see the same, a rapid increase in spending as we've seen in previous years. There might be some increase but probably not as much as we saw, for instance, in 2018. So I think that calls for another challenging year on hydraulic fracturing. Our focus here is just to continue to drive the efficiency of our operations and then focus on the commercial terms we have with our customers. And the focus here is not necessarily top line or market share. It's about margins, earnings contribution and cash. We have no CapEx plans to be deployed this year for fracking. We reactivated all the warm-stacked crews that we have set aside in Q4. They are now back up and running. And we still have another eight fleets that we can deploy without any CapEx requirements. So that's on the frac side. On the drilling side, we saw the rig count come down a bit in Q1 as expected. It might slide a little bit further in Q2 as well. And for sure, we don't expect any major rebound in rig activity over the course of this year. So that will have some impact on our drilling business and mainly on the basic technologies. And we still see strong uptake on rotary steerable and still solid pricing and profitability on that. So it's a bit of a mixed outlook for U.S. land. I think it's going to be a challenging year. The other thing we are focusing on is to continue to build our position in the technology dialogue with the IOCs that are ramping up both drilling and completions activities. So we're quite excited about the IOCs taking a bigger position in U.S. land. We work very well with them in the international markets. And I think that calls for a much more rich technology discussion going forward in U.S. land.
Kurt Hallead: All right, I appreciate that color. Maybe as an additional follow-up, the emphasis points here on offshore. I seem to recall that maybe in prior cycle periods, shallow water offshore could generate somewhere like 5x the revenue of maybe a U.S. – equivalent U.S. land rig, and deepwater could be something around 10x the revenue opportunity. Given some of the changes that we've seen in the context of reservoir drilling complexity in the U.S. land business, wondering if kind of some of those ratios kind of still – kind of hold up. And as we're kind of hitting down that path, can you give us some insights to kind of differential growth Schlumberger may have relative to some of its peers.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I can't confirm your numbers, although I will directionally say that the earnings, I would say potential we have internationally and whether that is on land or offshore, probably more so offshore, is obviously a lot higher than what it is in U.S. land down to the technology, down to the – just the complexity of the operating conditions. And also if you were to kind of look at the E&P dollars spent by our customers, I would for sure say that our earnings potential internationally is about 2x – sorry, is 4x of what it is compared to our competitors mainly due to the fact that we have twice the market share and roughly twice the operating margins. So the return of international growth and in particular, the return on offshore activity and exploration is what we have been waiting for. It's been quite a while of a wait here. Last year we had growth internationally was in 2014. So this is five years of waiting. So we are more than ready for this.
Kurt Hallead: Appreciate that color. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Next is the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Bill Herbert: Yes. Hey, good morning. You mentioned in segmenting your international incrementals 1/2 of legacy was highly accretive, 1/4 was moderately accretive, 1/4 was highly dilutive. Can you just segment that geographically for us. The half of the legacy international incrementals that are highly accretive, where is that being generated? Ditto for the quarter that's moderately accretive and ditto for the quarter that's highly dilutive on a regional basis.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks, Bill, for the question. So I was expecting that is to come, and we're not going to give more color on it. It has to do with how we handle this from a competitive standpoint, both what product lines, what geographies. So obviously we know what this is, and we have a very good handle on how we segment the international portfolio of contracts and operations. So I don't really want to go into the details of it. We have specific plans for the contracts that fall into this fourth quartile of our international business. But I don't really want to go into the details of what it is. That wouldn't be beneficial for our business.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And then similar segmentation question. Lower capital spending outlook 10%. Referenced from the late public E&Ps, the 40% to 45% rig count. With your discussion with KLO for profitabilities was just 40% to 45% [indiscernible] then there's 15% to 20% of rig count. And with the backdrop, oil prices up 40% to 45% year-to-date and markedly improved well economics, not only due to rising oil prices but also well cost inflations. I'm just curious as to whether you think that, that 60% of the rig count is going to be more responsive to cash flows in the second half of the year.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, you're breaking off in part of the question. The way I would answer this is basically – we see the IOCs will increase their spend, which again I think is good for us. We are obviously quite active in working with them. But we also see the majority of the market, which is still the E&Ps and the smaller E&Ps, are going to stay much closer to cash flow this year, which is really what's driving the reduction in E&P spend. So our number of kind of plus/minus down 10% is pretty much in line with some of the third-party surveys that you've seen as well. With an increase in oil prices continuing over the course of this year, there could be some improvements to this. But I think directionally, I don't see the same significant increase that you might have seen in earlier years mainly because of this newfound discipline on staying much closer to the free cash flow.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And finally, do you have a comment with regard to the Q2 consensus estimate of $0.35? Do you feel comfortable with that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Olivier, you want to comment?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. So let me start by commenting on revenue outlook. So for Q2, we expect low- to mid-single digit sequential revenue growth in the international business. This is due to the seasonal rebound that we'll see in the North Sea and Russia in contrast with the first quarter. We expect steady growth in Middle East & Asia. And we expect a more nominal sequential growth in Africa and Latin America when we compare to what we have seen in previous quarter against the growth that we have seen. In North America, I think you heard the comment before, we expect limited sequential growth firstly, because of the seasonal breakout in break-up in Canada. Next because the – if we see and have other fracturing activity up in stage counts, this will be largely offset by the impact of the lower pricing that was set during the key tendering and during Q1. So for Cameron – that is Cameron, I think it will be a smaller limited sequential growth on the back of strong OneSubsea, offset partially by drilling system and steady single-digit growth for both drilling and surface. So that summarizes the increment of revenue from Q1 to Q2. So as it comes from the margin, we continue to improve our operational efficiency and our present contractual terms with customers, so impacting the international business as we discussed. And we hope to start to impact the most dilutive lower quartile for our revenue base. But based on all this, we expect this Q2 EPS revolving towards the current Street consensus. And we don't foresee no real room, at this point, to further improvement and upside revision for that.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next we move on to the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jud Bailey: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on thinking about Reservoir Characterization margins in the path, kind of for this year. First quarter was a little lighter than we thought. But with all the commentary on exploration activity and offshore being so constructive, if you could help us think about the path for margins there. And I guess specifically, is it still feasible we see margins flat maybe year-on-year? Or is there potentially upside given kind of the work scope you're seeing on the exploration and offshore front?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I would expect our Reservoir Characterization margins to continue to improve this year from what we saw last year. The characterization business should be and will be the business that is typically leading our incremental margin levels. So with the growth that we are foreshadowing, both in terms of offshore activity and even more so offshore exploration, this is all staying straight down the fairway for what we are excellent at doing in Reservoir Characterization. So I expect margins in 2019 for characterization to be up, and that they will be – being in the leadership of driving our incremental margins in 2019.
Jud Bailey: Okay, I appreciate that. And then if I could, my second – my follow-up is on CapEx. Question we get a lot is with the CapEx guidance this year. There have been concerns that you may be not investing enough in the business on a longer-term basis. Could you maybe give us your thoughts on how you're thinking about for capital spending and the sustainability of maintaining all your earnings power and investing as the cycle kind of continues to grow?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I’ll comment on that. So first of all, what we've done through the modernization program is that we have opened up several new ways of driving effective capacity. In the past, typically, one unit of activity was served by one unit of additional CapEx. At this stage now, we have done three ways of serving our additional activity growth. One is through CapEx, but only a subset will be served by new CapEx. The other one is through the underlying efficiency improvements from the modernization program, and they will be much more visible when we start growing, which is the fact now. And then the third thing that we are also getting much better at, and that is to drive capacity also through higher OpEx. That could be through running more maintenance shifts to improve our investments, operating investments in logistics to get higher returns and so forth. So first, we have a much more balanced view on how to drive full-cycle capacity. And obviously the advantage of efficiency improvements and OpEx-derived capacity is that you can manage that much better in the full cycle. Now for 2019, what we try to do with breaking down the international revenue base, which is basically where we are deploying all our CapEx this year, it is to show that where we are growing at good incremental margins and good base returns, we are investing. And we are investing sufficiently, accompanied by the OpEx-derived capacity and the efficiency improvements. Where we are not going to deploy capital is in the part of the business which is not yielding the right returns. And in that part, we will high-grade the contract base. We will potentially move capacity around to get better returns for what we have deployed. And we will not deploy new capital into that part of the business until the returns are adequate. That might create shortages here and there. But at this stage we are prepared to do that. And we will do that in very close dialogue and cooperation with our customers so they know what our position is. But we cannot, and will not, deploy capital into operations which are not yielding the right returns.
Jud Bailey: Okay, great. I appreciate the color, Paal. I’ll turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, our last question comes from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Dave Anderson: Thanks, good morning. So regarding the OneStim business in North America. As you mentioned, the IOCs, E&Ps private sale spend differently. So I'm just wondering when you think about deploying those eight remaining fleets or perhaps moving some of the others around, do you think about this purely from an equipment utilization pricing standpoint? Or is it important to pull in your sand mines or perhaps some of your other higher-margin businesses when you're looking at that – when you look at each one of those fleets?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, generally, we will look at the returns we are going to get for the frac fleets that we deploy. That's partly down to pricing, but it is also down to the operating efficiency and how well we work with the customers where we deploy this capacity, right? So some of these other considerations around the use of technology in frac obviously plays into it. But I think the sand mines at this stage, this is what – we treat this as a separate business. A fair bit of the sand that we sell today is all the – independent of the frac operations. It's sold directly to either other frac companies or directly to our customers. So we obviously look at optimizing the whole situation here. But generally, when we deploy these eight additional fleets, it's going to be ensuring that we get the right returns on them by themselves where we deploy them.
Dave Anderson: Great, thanks, Paal. And then your Sensia JV you announced earlier this year, a really interesting business that seems to be kind of going after your sort of untapped market here. I was wondering if you could perhaps just give us a fair bit of an example of a target application? Conceptually, I get what you're talking about. Maybe if you can – like give us sort of field example of what you – kind of what Schlumberger and Rockwell each bring to the table. I'm also curious as to the business model. Is the goal here to create a performance-based model? It would seem sort of ideally suited for something like that. Is that part of the pitch? Or maybe it's too early to ask these type of questions?
Paal Kibsgaard: Olivier, you want to comment?
Olivier Le Peuch: Yes. No. Thank you. So I think it's a fair question. It's a fair observation that some of the business could be and will be driven by performance model. So outside application first for this JV will be existing producing asset, brownfield assets where we believe in the land application, that the power of automation, data analytics and digital application will increase the efficiency, the amenability, and decrease the maintenance and increase the up line of those assets. So example, I think actually is pump surveillance and optimization or at least as well, or existing process productivity where the surveillance and automation could be – help optimize some of the producing outputs of those operating assets. So we are getting excellent feedback from the joint engagement we have with some customers around the – what Sensia could bring to the market. It's too early to say because the closing is still some time in the summer where this will start. But we expect the double-digit growth trajectory when we start this venture. And we will certainly get the benefit of the leadership, recognized leadership of Rockwell Automation, process control and having digital solution for the outfit. And we'll bring our domain – deep domain expertise, our measurement portfolio and obviously our digital capability with a debt-free solution. So we believe it's a combination that is unique to the market, very well received and first application onto producing oilfield assets with, indeed, potential for a performance contract that will give us the upside on this automation opportunity.
Dave Anderson: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we'll turn the conference back to the host, right.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So before we end, I would like to summarize the main points from today's call. Firstly, I'd like to clarify that we expect the Q2 EPS to be in line with the Street consensus of $0.35, and we don't, at this stage, see any upside to this number. Furthermore, global E&P spending is starting to normalize, which directionally means increased international investments to offset the accelerating production decline, while North America land investments are heading lower due to the E&P cash flow constraints leading to a likely downward adjustments to the current production growth outlook. Second, in North America, where visibility into the second half of the year remains limited, we are fully focused on maintaining operational flexibility and improving financial returns and cash generation, leveraging the strong execution platforms we have built over the past years in hydraulic fracturing, drilling and artificial lift. And third, we now see clear signs of a broad international activity upturn emerging both online and in particular offshore, seen by increases in rig count, new project FIDs and also renewed interest in exploration. All our 2019 CapEx will be deployed into the 50% of our international revenue base that is already producing highly accretive incremental margins. At the same time, we focus on securing improved commercial terms or return to the high-grading our contracts in the upper half of our international revenue base, which today is highly dilutive to our operating and incremental margins. That concludes our remarks. Thank you for participating. We now conclude the call.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-18 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning. Good afternoon and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call.  Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, Wells. We will as usual first go through our prepared remarks, after which we will open up for questions. For today's agenda, Simon will first present comments on our fourth quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro.  However, before we begin, I would like to remind our participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details on reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who maybe in the queue. Now, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.36. This represents a decrease of $0.10 sequentially and $0.12 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded the net credit of $0.03 per share. This consisted of a gain on the divestiture of the WesternGeco marine seismic business, partially offset by certain asset impairment charges. Our fourth quarter revenue of $8.2 billion decreased 3.8% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margin decreased 172 basis points to 11.8%. Highlights by product group were as follows; Fourth quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 1% sequentially. A seasonal decline in wireline activity in Russia and reduced OneSurface revenue in the Middle East were partially offset by year end SIS Software sales. As a result, pre-tax operating margins of 22%, was essentially flat as compared to the previous quarter.  Drilling revenue of $2.5 billion increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by higher activity in Latin America and the Middle East, offset by a seasonal decline in Russia. Margins decreased 105 basis points to 12.9%, largely reflecting again seasonal decline in activity in Russia and increased mobilization costs, which impacted IDS internationally. Production group revenue of $2.9 billion decreased 10% sequentially, while margin decreased 310 basis points to 6.8%. These results were driven by reduced pricing and activity in the OneStim hydraulic fracturing business in North America land. Cameron group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 3% sequentially, as increase sales in service systems were more than offset by lower revenue from OneSubsea and Valves & Measurement. Cameron margin declined 140 basis points to 10% largely driven by OneSubsea.  On the positive side the book to bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle business increased to 1.5 in Q4 and the OneSubsea backlog increased $1.9 billion. This all bodes well for the future. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 16% in the fourth quarter. This is similar to the previous quarter.  Before discussing cash, I want to share with you something I constantly repeat within Schlumberger. Profit is an opinion, but cash is a fact. During 2018, we returned $3.2 billion of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. During the quarter we spent $100 million to repurchase 2.1 million at an average price of $48.44.  We generated $5.7 billion of cash flow from operations for the full year 2018 and $2.3 billion during the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow was $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter and $2.5 billion for the full year of 2018. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $340 million during 2018.  Additionally, during the quarter we completed the sale of our WesternGeco marine seismic business and received cash proceeds of $600 million. As a result our net debt decreased by $1.2 billion during the quarter to $13.3 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $2.8 billion. We expect that we will meet all of our cash commitments for 2019, without having to increase net debt year-over-year.  And now, I will turn the conference call over to Patrick. 
Patrick Schorn: Thank you, Simon and good morning everyone. In my geographical commentary today consolidated revenues include the results of the Cameron product lines.  For full year 2018, our consolidated revenues grew for a second year in a row increasing 8% over 2017. Performance was driven by North America, but revenue increased 26% due to the 41% growth of our OneStim business. Full year international revenue was essentially flat with the prior year although the second half of 2018 showed year-over-year growth of 3% marking the beginning of a positive activity trend after three consecutive years of declining revenues. Full year pre-tax operating income improved 7% over the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue however decreased 4% sequentially with the pre-tax operating income falling by 16%. This performance was driven by significantly lower land activity in North America, due to the weakness in the Permian that began with a production takeaway constraints in the middle of the year. Internationally, revenues proved more solid, despite seasonal slowdowns with the greatest strength in activity seen in the Middle East and Asia area. In North America, revenue decreased 12% sequentially as customers dramatically cut fracturing activity in response to lower oil prices. Although we were expecting weakness in the Permian, its effects were exacerbated by a further drop in the oil prices.  In response, we decided to warm stack frac fleets for the second half of the quarter and focus on securing dedicated contracts for the first half of 2019, early in the tendering cycle. As a result revenue from our OneStim business fell by 25%. U.S. land drilling activity on the other hand, proved robust during the quarter, with the rig count being largely flat sequentially and the wells drilled per rig remaining stable, despite average lateral lengths continuing to increase.  In this market, our operational efficiency, new technologies and broad range of business models helped drive Drilling & Measurements revenue higher in both the U.S. and Canada. Cameron revenue on land was lower sequentially from weaker revenue in Valves & Measurements and service systems due to the overall decline in North America land activity.  On the SPM Palliser asset in Canada, drilling continued with four rigs and in 2018 we drilled 123 wells and more than doubled oil production from 10,000 to 21,000 barrels per day. Offshore North America increased drilling activity on development projects and higher WesternGeco multi-client seismic license sales drove revenue higher. But this was not enough to offset lower Cameron activity. Looking ahead through the first quarter, equipment is now tied with activity expected to strengthen on the new exploration season in Alaska and Canada. Moving to the international markets, fourth quarter consolidated revenue grew 1% sequentially, despite the seasonal slowdown in Russia and Central Asia. Revenue increased in the Middle East and Asia area and in Europe and Africa, while Latin America was flat compared with the previous quarter.  One of our main drivers in the international activity during the year was the continual ramp up of our integrated drilling services business. Further rigs were mobilized during the fourth quarter, with full deployment being reached on many projects with startup in mobilization costs complete. As a result, we started to see operational efficiencies. Among the areas, consolidated revenue increased 2% sequentially in the Middle East and Asia area, primary from higher revenue in the Eastern, Middle East geo market during the strong integrated drilling services project in Iraq, where new contracts were signed. These included eight additional wells for Eni Iraq and a 40 well award for another operator. In Saudi Arabia, all 25 rigs on the lump sum turnkey contracts are now fully operational. 90 wells have already been drilled totaling almost 1.5 million feet. Full deployment has meant that asset deficiency and crew sizes can be optimized and new technologies evaluated for the performance improvements they bring. Time to drill each wells are beginning to shorten with one well being delivered in a record 16 days from spots to total depth. The success of our LSDK model has already led to a new contract award for further work, this time for a three year contract with a two year option for integrated rigless stimulation work. Stronger hydraulic fracturing activity in Oman and more wireline and testing exploration activity in the United Arab Emirates also contributed to our performance during the quarter. However, revenue decreased sequentially in the northern Middle East geo market from lower one service revenue in Kuwait and Egypt as projects were delivered. Revenue in the Far East Asia and Australia geo market was higher sequentially due to increased drilling and well construction activity in China, including the startup of the SEP gas SPM project and strong shale gas activity in the Sichuan province. In the Southeast Asia geomarket revenue increased in India from integrated drilling services contract with an additional seven wells drilled and improved performance.  We also won a sizable tender from an NOC in the region for the provision of M-I SWACO technology on more than 300 wells. Cameron revenue in the area was flat with the third quarter as increased service system sales in India were offset by reduced activity in Saudi Arabia, and in the Far East Australia geomarket. In Europe, CIS and Africa consolidated revenue increased 1% sequentially despite the seasonal activity decline in Russia and the North Sea. This effect was partially offset by SIS year-end software sales. Area revenue also benefited from sustained activity growth in the sub-Saharan Africa geomarket and year-end software and product sales in Angola, Mozambique, Gabon in West Africa. The project pipeline is building across this region and multiple deepwater rigs are scheduled to mobilize in the first half of 2019. Higher revenue was posted by the North Africa geomarket from new drilling projects in Algeria, and the start of both a well intervention project in Libya and operations in Chad. In the North Sea activity in Norway was flat with only minor seasonal impact. Our performance was strong in integrated projects. In Continental Europe, exploration and drilling in Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece increased, while drilling in Austria and Germany offset weaker activity in the Netherlands. Revenue in the Latin America area was flat sequentially. In Mexico and Central Asia, a Central America geomarket, revenue declined due to lower WesternGeco multi-client seismic license sales following the strong performance in the previous quarter. On the positive side, we won additional integrated awards in Mexico, including integrated drilling services and integrated services management contract that will start up in the first quarter of 2019. In Latin America South, intervention and exploration work for international oil companies was sustained, while in Brazil, Equinor awarded Schlumberger, a total well delivery contract for 22 wells.  Revenue in the Latin America North geomarket was flat sequentially, and in Ecuador the Shaya SPM project achieved record production of almost 70,000 barrels per day in December on increased activity and the new water flood field development strategy. In Venezuela, where activity was also flat sequentially, the situation degraded further with production to continuing to decline in an environment where inflation is accelerating and international banks are increasing restrictions. On a final note, OneSubsea booked orders were strong during the second half of the year, with more than 600 million booked during the fourth quarter. Many orders came from multiple repeat customers awarding smaller projects. However due to the sizable install base, this provides a solid platform for growth. OneSubsea awards projects from Equinor, Chevron Esso and Butai [ph].  The Equinor contract is for the industry's first all electric actuated boosting system for the Vigdis Field scheduled for first delivery in 2020. Also in the quarter, the subsea integration alliance a venture forums by OneSubsea and OneSubsea 7 delivered the longest deepwater multi-phase boosting tie back of 22 miles in the shortest implementation time on Murphy Oils, Dalmatian developments in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Similarly, the Subsea Integration Alliance delivered a record breaking 18 mile tie back in UK North Sea sector for TAQA in the Otter Field. And with that, let me pass the call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Patrick. Starting off with the industry macro view, the significant drop in oil prices in the fourth quarter was driven largely by the U.S. shale production surprising to the upside as a result of the surge in activity earlier in the year, and by geopolitics negatively impacting global supply and demand balance sentiments. The combination of these factors together with a large sell off in the equity markets due to concerns around global growth and increasing U.S. interest rates created a near perfect storm to close out 2018. Looking forward to 2019, we expect the supply and demand balance sentiment and the oil prices to improve over the course of the year, as the OPEC and Russia cuts take full effect. The lower activity in North America land in the second half of 2018 impact production growth, the dispensations from the Iran export sanctions expire and are not renewed and as the U.S. and China continue to work towards a solution to their ongoing trade dispute. So far in January Brent oil prices are already up around $10 supporting this improving outlook. Not surprisingly, the recent oil price volatility has introduced less visibility and more uncertainty around the E&P spend outlook for 2019, with customers generally taking a more conservative approach to the start of the year, again delaying the broad based recovery in the E&P spend that we expected only three months ago. However, from our customer discussions, we are seeing clear signs of E&P investment sentiments starting to normalize in the various parts of the world and heading towards a more sustainable financial stewardship of the global resource base.  In the international markets, outside the Middle East and Russia this means that after four years of underinvestment and focus on maximizing short-term cash flow, the NOCs and independents are starting to see the need to invest in their resource base simply to maintain production at current levels. At present, the underlying decline from the aging production base in key oil producing countries like Norway, UK, Brazil and Nigeria are being offset by new project startups, as well as more exploration activity providing solid growth opportunities for our business in the coming year. We are also seeing to start a new investment programs in countries like Mexico, Angola, Indonesia and China, where total production has already been in noticeable decline for several years now, supporting the activity recovery for our product lines also in these regions. Based on this oil market backdrop, we still expect solid year-over-year revenue growth in the international markets in 2019, starting off in the mid-single digits for the first half of the year, as our customers take a conservative approach due to the recent oil price volatility. Growth rates would be led by Africa, Asia and Latin America as new investment programs are kicked off in these regions. While we continue to see solid but more nominal growth rates in the North Sea, Russia and the Middle East as existing activity on projects continue to expand. Conversely for the North America land E&P operators, higher cost of capital, lower borrowing capacity and investors looking for capital discipline and increased return of capital, suggests that future E&P investments will likely be at levels much closer to what can be covered by free cash flow. Assuming the trend of increased capital discipline continues in 2019 and WTI oil prices steadily recover to average the same realized level as 2018, we expect E&P investments in U.S. land to be flat to slightly down compared to 2018, with a relatively slow start to the year. In this scenario it is likely that the E&P operators would gradually lower drilling activity and instead focus investments on drawing down the large inventory or drilled uncompleted wells. This approach would still drive production growth from U.S. land in 2019, but likely at a substantially lower rate than the 1.9 million barrels per day seen in 2018 and potentially with a further reduction in the growth rate in 2020. It is also worth noting that with the continued growth in U.S. shale production, an increasing percentage of the new wells drilled are being consumed to offset the steep decline from the existing production base. The third party analysis shows that in 2018, this number was 54% of total CapEx and is expected to increase to 75% in 2021, clearly demonstrating the unavoidable treadmill effect of shale oil production. Add to this, the emerging challenges of production per well as infield drilling creates interference between parent and child wells, as drilling steadily steps out from the core Tier 1 acreage and as the growth in lateral length and proppant per stage is starting to plateau, we could be facing a more moderate growth in U.S. shale production in the coming years than what the most optimistic views have been suggesting. From a 2019 U.S. land activity standpoint, we expect a slow but steady recovery of hydraulic fracturing work over the course of the year. Although the lingering impact of the pricing reset that took place in the fourth quarter of 2018. For drilling, we expect some impact to our U.S. land business from a potentially lower rig count. However, our high tech drilling business remains sold out and is still at a relatively low market penetration and should therefore be quite insulated from a lower rig activity. And for our U.S. artificial lift business, which operates at a 12 to 18 month lag from the hydraulic fracturing business, we are expecting a solid year for both our ESP and rod lift technologies. With a lower rate of production growth from U.S. shale together with a cut from OPEC in Russia and no major change to the current global demand picture, we expect to see global inventory growth in the second half of 2019, supporting an improving sentiment for the global supply demand balance. In this market environment we have built significant flexibility into our operating plan for 2019 giving us the means and confidence to effectively tackle any investments and activity scenario. In terms of capital allocations field equipment CapEx will be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, which together with the OpEx and efficiency drive capacity gains from our transformation program will be sufficient to handle the range of activity growth we see. Multi-client investments would be flat with 2018 and we will continue to seek significant customer prefunding for the projects we decide to take on. Lastly our SPM investments will be down by around $200 million in 2019 and we will produce positive free cash flow from our SPM business for the second consecutive year, while being parallel continue to discuss monetization opportunities with interested parties. In terms of M&A, we do not foresee any significant consumption of cash in 2019. Needless to say the foundation for our 2019 plans is a clear commitment to generate sufficient cash flow to cover all our business needs without increasing net debt. After a very strong free cash flow performance in the second half of 2018 where we generated $1 per share in the fourth quarter alone, we are confident in our ability to further improve on this in 2019 through our focus on international top line growth with improving incremental margins, continued capital discipline and careful management of working capital. With the changes relating to the corporate transformation program and the organizational streamlining now well behind us the entire Schlumberger organization is fully primed and ready for the business opportunities and challenges that lies ahead, with a clear objective of clearly exceeding the expectations of all our stakeholders. Thank you. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
James West: Hey, good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, James. 
James West: So Paal, lot of good financial positives that we're looking at, strong free cash flow, the lower 2019 CapEx, heavy prefunding for multi-client. I especially loved Simon's comment on profit versus cash. But it seems to me there's a large dichotomy developing in the market, it looks like you and probably your largest competitor are very much returns focused whereas in -- particularly international markets, whereas the North American market seems to have almost unbelievable lack of discipline in here.  I guess, so the question is, one, is that a fair characterization of your strategy and kind of how you see the differences in those in the big international market versus North America. And then two, are you comfortable that with the capital previously spent you can handle the contracts that are coming your way and that you haven't starved the asset base particularly internationally.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks for the question, James. So, starting with the first part, I think it's a fair representation of our strategy and how we look at things. We have always been disciplined in terms of how we deploy capital. But I think the last four or five years have made us I think further elevate the focus and the approach we take to this. We've obviously have very clear benefits now from having done a lot of work around the transformation program, which allows us firstly to drive down our working capital as a percentage of revenue, which is basically I think an all-time low now. At the same time as we can be lot more prudent in terms of what CapEx we need to spend to take off new work and higher activity. So from our standpoint this is along the plans of what we have been working on in recent years and I'm very happy to see this coming to fruition now. And obviously driving programs that are focused on efficiency are a lot more effective and visible when you have some growth. If you are flat or you’re declining, these are obviously less visible. So this is the first year 2019 that we are seeing growth in the international market since 2014. So we are ready for this and you are right in pointing out that we are very focused on the capital discipline. But at the same time, we also have the capability firstly to scale the level of investments we have, we are working very actively on drawing down the lead times for things like new equipment and so forth. But at the same time, we have the ability now to drive our effective capacity not only through CapEx. The underlying efficiency in how we turn our tools and also the utilization we have of our field workforce is steadily improving. And we also have through the modernization program, the opportunity to actually increase effective capacity to OpEx investments, which are, they have lot shorter lead time and they're also a lot more scalable up and down, which is highly needed in our cyclical business. So, I truly agree with what you point out, and we are very much focused on continuing along this direction. 
James West: Okay, that's great to hear, Paal. And then you'd made some comments towards, I guess, early last year and even toward the end of the year that you would effectively be sold out of capacity internationally by the end of 2018 based on contract awards. Is that still the case? And so that the -- what we see today is much tighter utilization of assets international, it could lead to some pricing power in 2019?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I think we are for the high-end product lines and the high-tech offering around those lines. We are more or less sold out at present and I think you'll -- it's safer to assume that a large part of the CapEx budget for 2019 is going to be focused in on making sure we do have enough capacity to take on that work.  But absolutely, I think there are going to be opportunities to get pricing for end markets where we are at balance capacity wise, and also where the technology and the performance that we bring value to our customers. So I think we need to have that as a basis for the discussions. And I think we're starting to see opportunities around the world to now continue to have those discussions as we go into 2019. And I would also just point out, James, that actually a significant part of the drop in the CapEx investments between 2018 and 2019 is actually North America. So there is no real significant drop in our allocations towards international.
James West: Okay, perfect. Thank you, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks.
Operator: Next we go to line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: So as we sized up the growth potential abroad, one important inflection that our team forecast was actually increased spending by the majors abroad for the first time this cycle. In the release, you mentioned spending increases by NOCs and independents, but there wasn’t a mention of increase by the majors on the international front. Paal, what's your outlook for spending by this group outside the U.S.? Do you see them increasing CapEx as well? And if you do, roughly how much? And just in general, do you sense any greater urgency by this group to improve the reserve replacement ratio, which has been quite low, as you know, over the past few years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, in the commentary, we did highlight the NOCs and the independents, because that's where we have most clarity around plans and where we see the most visible programs being in place. I still expect that there will be some increase on the IOCs. They are -- at present, they are a little bit less visible and maybe a little bit less pronounced. But I'm sure that all our customers are continuing to kind of work through their budgets and look at their plans and opportunities and the IOCs have, I'm sure plenty of opportunities to ramp up spend if they decide to. Some of the IOCs are already quite active in new areas and we’re obviously working closely with them. So, I think for me it's more lack of visibility at present for me to point out IOCs. We have a very close working relationship with them. And I'm sure that for the right opportunities, they might also increase their investments. But what stands out where we have pretty clear visibility at present is the NOCs and the independents.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And I may have missed this in the prepared remarks. But how should we think about the budget for SPM in 2019? I heard the free cash positive outlook, which is great to hear. But it sounds like it's coming down some, but how should we think about it?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, like I said in the prepared remarks our CapEx investments for SPM is down by about $200 million to roughly $800 million. And this is -- it’s a combination of all the several of our projects maturing, reaching more of a plateau stage. Some of the investments that we made have been very effective and we're also obviously scrutinizing every dollar we spend in all parts of the business including SPM.  So there's nothing dramatic in it coming down other than that there has been successful deployments of programs on many of the projects, as well as we are very prudent on how we allocate capital. 
Scott Gruber: Got it, thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you. 
Operator: Next we have a question from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead. 
Kurt Hallead: Hey. Good morning. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning. 
Kurt Hallead: Hey, thanks for all the color here. I think follow up I had was, when you think about the opportunity set in the international market and you kind of reference the type of customer base, I was wondering, Paal if you can kind of give us a general rank order of what region do you see offering the highest growth in 2019? Maybe you could talk about it top three or four markets and again that could be outside of the Middle East and Russia, because I think you expect those probably be the best growth areas. So any color on that would be helpful.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So I think I'll split it into two buckets here where, if you look at our business today compared to say 2014, where we still have by far the highest revenue and activity compression it is in Latin America, it is in Africa and it is in Asia. Both the North Sea, Russia and the Middle East have invested much more sustainably through the downturn we've been through. So actually it's very clear to us where the highest growth rate is coming from and that is in Latin America, it's in Africa and it's in Asia. Now -- so very solid growth rates coming from these regions. Now we're also expecting growth from the North Sea, the Middle East and Russia, but at a lower rate. But in spite of the lower rates, we have very significant presence in these regions big businesses. So in terms of earnings contributions, it's actually quite meaningful even from these regions although the actual growth rate is somewhat lower than what we see in Latin America, Africa and Asia. 
Kurt Hallead: Okay, great, and then significant emphasis on free cash flow generation and prudent use of capital. So in the context of that when you factor in CapEx, dividends, SPM and investment in multi-client data, to what extent do you expect to be cash -- generating positive cash after those expenditures in 2019.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, Simon, do you want to take that?
Simon Ayat: Yes, sure. Okay. Look I will probably repeat a little bit what I said on the -- in my comment. So you saw that Q4 was extremely strong cash flow. It is what we expected and what we planned. Maybe it came a little bit surprise to other people, but we have always expected to make this cash flow.  We made during the year some exceptional payment mainly in the severance of about $340 million. When you factor back these in, we produce enough cash to return capital. We get some also proceeds from options and some of our plans like discounted stock purchase plan that brings back. So we see 2019 as good as 2018 if not better. As we said, that we will meet all our commitments without increasing our net debt. This will be mostly free cash flow. Our working capital at very significantly low as compared to what can we have done before. During the quarter, we improved receivables by over $500 million. So just back on for your question about 2019, yes 2019, we're going to meet all our commitments and probably we’ll do better than what we’re expecting.
Kurt Hallead: Yes, appreciate that. Paal, maybe one follow up, in the past you've been willing to provide some qualitative commentary about where you think Schlumberger is headed vis-à-vis the street consensus numbers. So you would be willing to take a whack at that for both first quarter 2019 and for all of 2019.
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I'm not going to take a whack at the full year or 2019. What I would say directionally, on 2019, is that we do expect solid growth in the international. We expect in North America the investments total E&P investments to be flat to down, which means, I think it's going to be fairly tough year in North America. The impact of this on earnings, I think it's too early to say. I think we're going to have to just monitor that closely and be ready to act and deal with it. But I mean for us the main focus at this stage now is to capitalize on the growth opportunities International.  And we also see the long cycle businesses of Cameron, I think dropping in the first half of the year. And we should start to get some overall positive contributions from Cameron in terms of growth rates in the second half of this year. So full year the main I think direction is solid growth internationally, a bit of challenge in North America land, which we are fully equipped to handle. Now for Q1, normally we see about a 10% to 15% drop in EPS from Q4 to Q1. This is typically due to the seasonal slowdown due to winter weather. And also we have generally lower product sales in the first quarter after the search typically in the fourth.  Now for Q1 of 2019, we expect to be in the low end of this range. Now we're going to have the normal impact of winter, but we're going to see the continued growth in parts of international which I think is continuing in from the relatively strong performance we saw in Q4. This is likely going to be offset by a relatively slow start to U.S. land. But on the positive I think we'll see a lower sequential impact from product sales given that the year-end effect was quite low in Q4.  So I would say sequential into Q1 in the low range of the historical drop in EPS and then we should -- and obviously Q1 should be the lowest quarter of 2019. And again growth sequentially and year-over-year is going to be driven by Latin America, Africa and Asia.
Kurt Hallead: That's excellent. Thank you so much, appreciate it.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you. 
Operator: Next we have a question from Bill Herbert with Piper Jaffray Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Bill Herbert: With regard to M&A you mentioned no significant M&A in 2019. Where do you stand with regard to the acquisition of EDC at this stage?
Paal Kibsgaard: So where we stand is that we have satisfied all our obligations relating to the approval process for the transaction with the Russian authorities. We've been working on this now since we announced the transaction back in July of 2017. Now unfortunately we have not yet been able to obtain the needed regulatory approval from the Russian authorities. So our plan here is that we are going to make one final attempt an approach over the coming weeks. And if we see no clear path to obtaining the needed approvals we are likely going to withdraw our application. But instead we will seek alternative avenues in partnership with Eurasia Drilling to again further our participation in the conventional land drilling market in Russia, which we still see as very attractive.  So basically bottom line we’ll make one final attempt in the coming weeks. And if we aren’t successful there we will likely withdraw.
Bill Herbert: Okay, thank you. And Patrick, with regard to the monetization of the SPM portfolio, this is not the most hospitable time for oil. So I'm just curious as to what you think is the realistic timeline for dispositions of assets an order of magnitude?
Patrick Schorn: Yes. I think that is a fair question, Bill. So clearly this is something that we continue to work on and the program that we have currently, when you're talking about the sizable deals that would be visible to you. We have the full intent to conclude one in 2019 and one in 2020 the way it looks at this moment and this is really talking about some of the largest projects that we have.  There might be some smaller ones that might not necessarily make the headline, but significant ones count on one in 2019 and one in 2020 some of that is related to where we are in the value generation in the field. And some of the fields that we have, have some contractual limitations that make the timeline that I just mentioned the most appropriate one.
Bill Herbert: And when you say significant, what exactly does that mean, just kind of a broad range of expectations. 
Patrick Schorn: So that means that would be fields that would be for instance the one that we have in Canada that could very well include the activity that we have in Argentina. So think about the Palliser field, think about Bandurria Sur and there might be some North Africa ones and some smaller projects in there as well. But mainly the ones that we'll be focusing on is Canada and Argentina.
Bill Herbert: Okay, thank you.
Patrick Schorn: Thank you.
Operator: Next is the line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
James Wicklund: Good morning, guys. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, James. 
James Wicklund: You have grown production to be about 35% to 40% of revenues. And this segment is the lowest margin business it's 7% in the quarter down I think it was 310 basis points. You noted the pricing reset in Q4 in U.S. pressure pumping and never in my career, here's the first cut estimates in a slowdown been the only one.  Can you give us an idea as to where production margins might go over the next several quarters? When they might bottom? And more importantly, what can they get up to in three to five years in a good market, what's the potential?
Paal Kibsgaard: Good question. I would say that if you look at the margin performance of the production group, I think there are parts of it that we are, I think, quite happy with. And I think there are other parts that we are actively working on improving. If you look at 2018, we had -- we carried significant costs surrounding the capacity deployment that we did in U.S. land, which obviously impacted the total year margins. And as you point out, we are heading into some headwinds in U.S. land on the production side going into 2019. But I would say that we have a lot of focus on it. We have I think we know where the upsides are in terms of both our execution and how we handle all the commercial aspects of the business.  So I would say to answer the second part of the question first, our production margins should for sure to be in the double-digits going forward. And I think I would say steadily improving from where it is today in the coming years, with a caveat around what could happen over the next couple of quarters in U.S. land? But we have a very clear view on how we are going to drive these upwards. And I think getting it into double-digits is something that there is an urgent priority for us. And there is a lot of work and thought that's gone into how we are going to do that. 
James Wicklund: Okay, thank you for that. And the pragmatic view of that you guys are putting out today I think is very positive. My follow up if I could, return on invested capital, we did a little screen here recently and there was only like eight companies out of 85 public oilfield service companies that even earn their cost of capital in the trailing 12 months. And the trailing 12 months arguably may be the peak of results for a little while.  You guys have championed for the last six years trying to get the industry to use different forms of contracting and payment. And I've got a whole industry that has round trip market value in 16 years, basically tripling the value of the E&P industry and capturing none of the value for themselves.  How does that change going forward? How does the industry -- and you're the leader in the industry. How does the industry finally get to a point, where they can earn their cost of capital at some points other than the peak of a seven year cycle?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think that the way we do that is to continue to drive forward. Firstly, the underlying value and the performance of the service and the products that we sell to our customers that's number one. But beyond that, I think it's a matter of having contractual arrangement, contractual terms where we capture a fair value of what we generate.
James Wicklund: Are you making any progress on that?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think we are. Obviously in the commercial environment that we have been facing, it has been very difficult to translate all of this into visible improvements in return on capital employed. But if you look at the underlying performance of these key businesses, in particular in international market, we continue to do well. And again there is significant upside potential in terms of both how we are performing technically and again how we convert that technical performance into commercial results through the contractual arrangements as well. So I think we have a good view on again, what needs to happen. We have a good dialogue with our customer base. And there is a general shift in acceptance of moving towards these performance-based contracts, whether this is all the way off to lump sum turnkey or smaller it has smaller performance elements of it. So I think when the market at least now internationally stabilizes so that you have no longer pricing headwinds. If we can get into a stable pricing environment and improving technical performance, I believe we have the contractual framework and the contract base to start demonstrating to you and the rest of the investment community that this is going to head in the right direction. 
James Wicklund: Paal, thank you very much. Appreciate it, guys. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Jim. 
Operator: Our next question is from line of Edward Muztafago with Societe Generale. Please go ahead. 
Edward Muztafago: Hi, guys. Appreciate a lot of the great insight you gave this call. One other things I wanted to focus on and we're trying to get our heads around a little bit here is really the subsurface challenges that you've highlighted in the U.S. and I think we're all starting to see in some of the production data now.  The ability to offset this with technology, Paal, I'd like to maybe get your thought processes to whether you think the industry can or is on the costs of another, we call it technology genesis, effectively figuring out the subsurface sauce a little bit better, and if that's a risk to the upside on production.
Paal Kibsgaard: I think it's very clear from our standpoint and we believe there are technologies and innovations beyond just higher efficiency and doing things faster and using more things to get higher production. I think there's a lot of other things that can be done. Things around subsurface measurements understanding much more of the production dynamics, the rock itself and what's going on down whole we obviously invested in that for a number of years and I think we have -- we are starting to get quite a good understanding of this. And then beyond that I think a lot of it has to do with the conformity of the fracking that we do today. I mean, today there are, for every stage there are proliferation clusters that we likely are not reaching and tracking and with that you don't get the optimal conformity of how the fraction effort propagate. So there's a lot of work already we've done, at least in our behalf both on the subsurface understanding as well as how you can put more science into how you design and do the down hole part of the fracking, right? I think with this I think things like parent child production interference for sure can be mitigated. And there are probably other things that can be done in terms of orientation on wells, in terms of the completion technologies, and so forth. So I think there is still a significant upside potential in technology deployment into the shale industry.  And again, this is why, we have continued to invest into this business in terms of having capacity, because if you want to be part of changing the outcome of the game, you need to be on the pitch playing. So I think it's a very good question and something that we continue to invest into and that we continue to engage with our customers on in particular in U.S. land.
Edward Muztafago: Well, unfortunately there's only a handful of companies who can do that. So that's good. I wonder if we can maybe shift gears a little bit to the offshore market as well, certainly highlighted what you think the NOCs may do. Given the commodity price backdrop, but also the fact that number of these companies are really kind of facing the reserve cliff, and not too many years ahead?  Do you feel like the offshore market or the deepwater market specifically is at the point where it largely is going to shake off the commodity price and we're going to continue to see the deepwater recovery progress in 2019?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think simple answer is, yes. We're not going to have a dramatic surge deepwater activity, I think we have it down probably in between 5% to 10% increase in deepwater drilling activity, which is nice step in the right direction. I think what the operators that sits on these opportunities in offshore deepwater. A lot of the focus is obviously now on tie back into existing infrastructure, which shortens the cash cycle. We mentioned several awards and several projects that we've done around this through our OneSubsea product line.  So we see a continuous kind of steady recovery in deepwater and I think even at the current oil prices of $60 Brent, I think many of these projects are quite valuable. I think where the potential nervousness has been in terms of investment is, where is the floor. And I think what we have done over the past couple of years now, at least, is to establish, I think, a fairly visible floor at roughly $50 Brent. And I think with having that as a backdrop, I think more of the operators are prepared to make investments, and if they can make them shorter cycle by tying into existing production facilities. I think this is the trend we're seeing and I think this is what's driving the increased activity in deepwater.
Edward Muztafago: Okay. Thank you, Paal. Appreciate that.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Chase Mulvehill: Very good morning. I guess, I'll follow up on kind of the technology adoption here in U.S. shale. Can you maybe just talk about how you've seen technology adoption over the past couple of quarters. And do you see more opportunity for technology on the completion side or the drilling side in shale?
Paal Kibsgaard: We see opportunities actually in both. We have part of our CapEx investments in 2018, we had a big priority and continuing to deploy high end drilling technologies into U.S. land. This is basically primarily driven by Rotary steerable deployment, but also with I would say purpose designed bits that goes together with our Rotary steerable system. So there's a lot to be done in the -- I think in the drilling space in terms of how fast we drill these super long laterals now, which is obviously getting more complicated to do. And just a simple motor solution I think is obviously largely inferior compared to the high end Rotary steerable systems. But at the same time on the frac side, I think there are a lot of things that can be done actually both on the surface and downhole. Surface is all about how we drive efficiency, how we use I think digital solutions to operate the entire frac spread.  So we've done a lot of work in terms of software control and optimization on how we run the pumps, how we start up the pumps, how we drive reliability and at the same time downhole both in terms of the completion activity how do we minimize the time we use in between each stage and also how do we get the conformity up in terms of hitting each proliferation cluster and getting the maximum connectivity of the fracture. So, we are seeing some uptake on this, but the penetration is still relatively low. But again, we continue to engage with our customers and I think the performance is really what tells the story here and we starting to get more and more case studies around the success of the technologies that will be deploy.
Chase Mulvehill: Do you think that the pricing strategy has to change to go to more towards performance-based to kind of see more technology adoption.
Paal Kibsgaard: In U.S. land I don't think we necessarily need a dramatic change to the commercial framework. That would probably take a bit more time. I think as long as -- from our standpoint, as long as our customers are ready to see the value in what technology brings and there is a reasonable sharing of the additional value that is created, we are happy to do that on a conventional type of contractual setups. So that's not a problem.  I think the main thing is to demonstrate the value of the technology. And then having a reasonable split of the upside value between us who have been invested into the technology and the customer who gets the benefit.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. One quick follow up, U.S. shale just seems like there's going to be more scaling up and scaling down as we move forward. How does your strategy change as we kind of think about U.S. shale going forward just given the cost of scaling up and scaling down?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think scaling up and scaling down is going to be a significant part of how you drive full cycle returns and being able to do that, like you say cost effectively I think is important. So I think for us when we scale up I think we will focus probably more on doing it in increments and having a view of okay what's the growth trajectory of this cycle. And then having plans in place to make a step change in activity maybe rather than a steady increase over time which is -- in which case you carry a lot more cost with you continuously. The vertical integration, I think is a key part of how we scale up and down. This has actually turn out to be a very good investment for us and highly accretive in 2018 to our frac margins and what we’re doing here is as we scale up we will obviously use our own vertically integrated product and transportation system. However in the downturn in some cases we can actually mothball a fair bit of this, the mothball in costs are quite low and if other providers all product and transportation are willing to sell it at way below cost price level we will just buy off the market in a down cycle. So I think we have a lot of flexibility and we have built these plans with the eye on being able to effectively scale up and scale down and thereby maximizing the full cycle returns. 
Chase Mulvehill: Got it, very helpful. Thanks, Paal. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you. 
Operator: And our final question is from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Sean Meakim: Hi, thank you. Somewhat related to maybe near-term, can you just talk a little bit about specifically your plan to approach OneStim this year, balancing utilization versus pricing concession depending on how demand unfolds. And I'm sure if there are scenarios in which you could end up staking some fleets to preserve margins for the production group.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, we've obviously warm stacked a number of fleets in the fourth quarter. We have brought back quite a few of them already as we speak, but beyond that we have cold stack capacity also ready to go if activity dictates. So -- but I think what you'll see at this stage now is we're going to make sure that we focus 2019 on two things. And that is to have reasonable margins coming out of this business and to have very good cash flow. Those are the two priorities with where we stand today. And then we have ample capacity to pursue I would say growth opportunities towards the backend of 2019 into 2020. But again we're probably look at during this much more in increments where we're going to take a view on a market saying two to four quarters out and we might activate a number of fleets in a short period of time and then stabilize operations and again drive margins from that. So we have a lot of flexibility in the system of how we are going to attack this market. Initial focus now is operating margins and strong cash flow.
Sean Meakim: That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then thinking about your leading positions in some of the other parts of that market's drilling services, cementing. Can you talk about what your teams seeing in the field in terms of pricing pressure or your expectations for how those product lines going to unfold in 2019?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, in drilling we haven't seen any real pricing pressure as of yet. We have seen a few rigs dropped off here and there mainly I think as some customers now with taking conservative spend approach to 2019, we'll probably prioritize drawing down their duct [ph] balances instead of drilling new wells. But nothing dramatic as of yet. Little bit impact on activity, nothing really on price and drilling. And on the artificial lift side, really no impact on price, this product line operates at the sort of a 12 to 18 months lag from the frac activity. So we actually expect to see a solid year on artificial lift in 2019.
Sean Meakim: Great, thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you. So before we close today's call, let me summarize the main messages. We expect solid year-over-year revenue growth in international markets in 2019, despite customers likely taking a conservative approach to spending due to the recent oil price volatility. In North America on the other hand, the range of customer spending is probably more varied. We expect E&P investments on land in the U.S. to be flat to slightly down compared to 2018 with a relatively slow start to the year. And finally, the foundation for our 2019 plan is a clear commitment to generate sufficient cash flow to cover all our business needs through continued capital discipline without increasing net debt. Thank you very much for listening in.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning. Good afternoon and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2018 earnings call. Today’s call is being hosted from New York following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, Wells. We will as usual first go through our prepared remarks, after which we will open up for questions. For today’s agenda, Simon will present comments on our third quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro. However, before we begin, I would like to remind our participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details on reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who maybe in the queue. Now, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share was $0.46. Excluding charges and credits this represents an increase of $0.03 sequentially and an increase of $0.04 when compared to the same quarter last year. There were no charges or credits recorded in the current quarter. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion increased 2% sequentially primarily driven by strong international drilling activities. Pre-tax operating margins increased by 36 basis points to 13.5%. Highlights by product group were as follows. Third quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 2% sequentially primarily due to higher wireline and integrated services management activity in the international markets. This was partially offset by the completion of the first phase of an integrated production system project. Margin increased 88 basis points to 22.3% primarily driven by the increase in higher margin wireline activity. Drilling revenue of $2.4 billion increased 9% sequentially. This increase was driven by strong international growth and benefited in integrated drilling services. Drilling and measurements and MIs were core activities. Margins increased 103 basis points to 14% as profitability improved in certain IBS projects that started in the prior quarter. The overall increase in drilling activity also contributed to the margin improvement. Production revenue of $3.3 billion and margins of 9.8% were essentially flat. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion was also flat sequentially. Increased sales in surface systems and drilling systems were offset by lower revenue in OneSubsea and valve and measurements. Margins declined 140 basis points to 11.4% primarily driven by the lower OneSubsea revenue. The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle business was at 1. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16.4% in the first quarter compared to 17.2% in the previous quarter. We generated $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations during the quarter. Our net debt slightly decreased during the quarter to $14.5 billion. We ended the quarter with total tax and investments of $2.9 billion. During the quarter we spent $100 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $64.98. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $565 million and capitalized cost relating to SPM projects of $285 million. During the quarter we also made $692 million of dividend payments. Full year 2018 CapEx excluding SPM and multi-client investments are still expected to be approximately $2 billion. And now I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.
Patrick Schorn: Thank you, Simon and good morning everyone. Schlumberger revenue in the third quarter of 2018 increased 2% sequentially with pretax operating income increasing 5%. In North America while we continue to gain market share in artificial lift and drilling, takeaway constraints in the Permian led to lower activity for our OneStim hydraulic fracturing business. Internationally, we continued to benefit from the broad based recovery that began in the second quarter seeing solid growth in all operating regions, driving international sequential revenue growth ahead of sequential growth in North America for the first time since the second quarter of 2014. As usual I will first discuss the revenue growth by geography without Cameron before concluding with a few remarks on Cameron’s third quarter performance. In North America revenue of $2.6 billion increased 1% sequentially, on land drilling revenue grew 5% sequentially to outperform the 3% increase in the land rig count. Rotary steerable systems were again in demand to meet customer needs for longer laterals required in shale oil development for optimum well performance. Higher product sales for artificial lift systems which grew by 10% also contributed to third quarter performance. These positive results however were largely offset by the weakness in the hydraulic fracturing market that developed during the quarter. While the quarter began by leveraging second quarter fleet additions, customer activity weakened during the third quarter as takeaway constraints in the Permian limited production growth. The resulting excess hydraulic horsepower in the market led to softer pricing and as a consequence of this we did not add more of our spare fleet capacity during the quarter. The rapid changing in the dynamics of the hydraulic fracturing market again highlighted the operational agility and execution needed to efficiently manage resources and to effectively control supply chain costs. The robust performance of vertically integrated sand mining and delivery business is one of the key elements of this where we in addition to supplying our OneStim operations with sand now also are successfully completing in the third-party sand market as an integrated hydraulic fracturing company. The multistage stimulation business for completion in North America land saw a record number of stages installed in Q3. Broadband precision technology has seen steady uptake throughout the year from multiple customers in Canada and the Permian. The reliability of this technology allows not only efficient fracking of wells with 20 stages per day, but also selective sleeve closing and reopening to better manage water and sand production as the well cleans up. We also continued to see solid new technology sales in the U.S. land market. The growth of our drilling business has been underpinned by technologies such as PowerDrive rotary steerable systems and AxeBlade drill bits, which have become the key enablers for drilling longer lateral sections. One new bit technology introduced during the quarter was the HyperBlade hyperbolic diamond element bit, a development of our market leading StingBlade and AxeBlade bits. HyperBlade bits lowered drilling costs by improving the rate of penetration while maintaining steering response and directional tracking in the soft and plastic rock formation that make up many of the unconventional reservoirs. At the same time the emergence of well and reservoir performance issues are leading to new focused cementing technologies, such as the CemFIT Shield mud-sealing cement system that provides the industry’s first zonal isolation technology, specifically designed to improve isolation between hydraulic fracturing stages in long horizontal wells. On the major SPM Palliser asset in Canada, drilling continued with 4 rigs. Drilling efficiency and advanced drilling systems continued to drive performance. So far, 93 wells have been drilled and a further 30 are expected by year end. On the completion side, OneStim has enabled higher efficiency and reduced cycle time between drilling and flowback, accelerating production of new oil. Overall, well production has met or exceeded type curve expectations and total oil production is up 54% year-to-date. Offshore in North America, revenues decreased 4% sequentially as drilling activity was impacted by scheduled platform maintenance. At the same time, activity also shifted to work-over operations and the combination of these changes led to a less favorable activity mix for us. Turning now to the international areas, third quarter revenue, excluding Cameron, increased 4% sequentially as the broad-based international recovery continues across all regions. Our sequential performance was led by growth in Latin America and the Middle East due to higher activity for both national oil companies and independent operators, while Europe, CIS and Africa saw solid growth boosted by strong activity in Russia. The ramp up of our international IDS activity continued with an additional 19 rigs being mobilized in the quarter and revenue climbing on the back of the previous quarter’s mobilizations. We expect our excess international equipment capacity to be fully absorbed by year end after which we see increasing opportunities for pricing leverage as customers seek to secure services for new projects. Excluding Cameron, revenue in Latin America increased 7% sequentially driven by strong performance in the Mexico and Central America geomarket from increased drilling and reservoir characterization activity. Revenue in the Latin America North geomarket was also up from higher activity on SPM projects in Ecuador. In Shushufindi, we reached a resolution of legacy payment issues and we amended commercial terms to establish a solid and stable operating framework that will enable future investments for further increasing production. Elsewhere in Latin America North, strong activity growth in Colombia as operating capacity tightened further created opportunities for increased pricing. We also saw progress in Latin America South, where increased activity in Brazil was fueled by international oil company intervention and exploration work, while in Argentina higher operational efficiency drove increased fracturing activity. Also in Argentina, results from the first two wells on the YPS SPM project exceeded expectations and can be considered among the best producers in the Vaca Muerta formation to-date. Revenue in Europe, CIS, Africa, excluding Cameron increased 4% as strong activity in Russia and sub-Saharan Africa more than offset the impact of labor disputes and scheduled summer maintenance in the North Sea. The activity growth in Russia and Central Asia was driven by summer campaigns in Russia land, Sakhalin and Kazakhstan. Wireline, drilling and measurements and testing services were the main beneficiaries of this growth. Eastern Europe also saw stronger activity. Revenue in the sub-Saharan Africa geomarket increased with the start of new projects in Ghana and Mozambique, stronger drilling activity in Central and West Africa, and higher product and equipment sales in Nigeria, Angola, and Namibia. Customers are returning to exploration activity in the region and consequently, we are beginning to see demand return for higher technology services. The offshore market strengthened further during the quarter, including demand for a stimulation vessel fleet, where available capacity in West Africa is nearly sold out ahead of the 2019 ramp up. This is paving the way for market share gains and improved pricing. The North Africa geomarket benefited from solid activity in Libya despite the volatile security environment and from strong operational execution in Chad on integrated services management contracts. Middle East and Asia revenue, excluding Cameron, increased 3%, led by the continued ramp up of lump-sum turnkey projects in Saudi Arabia and by strong IDS activity in Iraq and United Arab Emirates. We added additional rigs during the quarter in Saudi Arabia, keeping us on track to have mobilized 25 rigs by the end of the year. These positive effects however were partially offset by lower hydraulic fracturing activity as a major contract was completed and demobilized in Saudi Arabia. In Asia, the South and East Asia geomarkets posted sequential growth on increasing IDS work in India and on new ISM projects that mobilized in Malaysia. In the Far East Asia and Australia geomarkets, revenue was driven by increased drilling activity offshore Indonesia and by a return to exploration work in Australia. Turning now to Cameron, revenue was largely unchanged from the previous quarter. Increased sales for service systems in North America and service activity for drilling systems in Europe, together with increased pressure control system sales in the Middle East were offset by lower revenue and backlog from OneSubsea. Looking at the Cameron backlog for drilling systems however, the total figure added at the end of the third quarter in 2018 was already significantly higher than that added for the whole of 2017. This is a further indication of the moves being made by offshore drilling contractors as they prepare for increased activity. And with that, let me pass the call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Patrick and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, the broad-based international recovery continued, while the business environment in U.S. land hydraulic fracturing changed rapidly with both activity and pricing softening more than expected over the course of the quarter. In parallel with this, the global supply and demand balance tightened further with another draw in global oil inventories and a $10 increase in oil prices during the quarter. Based on this industry backdrop, I would like to address three key questions that are central to our business outlook. First, why is there a strong need for a significant multi-year increase in global E&P investments? Second, why is Schlumberger best positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities? And third, why will Schlumberger generate the best operating profits and cash flow in the coming up-cycle? The international production base still accounts for around 80% of global supply and its critical to the stability of the oil market as a mere 1% net decline would represent around 800,000 barrels per day of lower production. Production growth from the international market has, since 2013, been driven by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran and Russia, which combined have added 3.7 million barrels per day, while the rest of the international production base is down by 1.5 million barrels per day over the same period. Since 2014, many of the international operators have focused on maximizing cash flow by producing their fields harder and by prioritizing short-term actions at the expense of the required full cycle investments. This short-term investment focus offers a finite set of opportunities over a limited period of time and this period is now clearly coming to an end as seen by accelerating decline rates in many countries around the world. In addition, reduced production tailwind from new projects that were sanctioned and largely funded prior to 2014, are now uncovering the underlying weakness in the international production base. Furthermore, additional investments will also be required to replace the Venezuelan and Iranian barrels that are now rapidly disappearing from the market. So, in our view, after 4 years of low activity, the international production base now needs significant growth in investments for the foreseeable future simply to maintain production flat at current levels. The North American production base, which makes up the remaining 20% of global supply, has absorbed close to 70% of the demand growth since 2010 initially supported by the Eagle Ford and Bakken and more recently by the Permian basin. However, the well-established market consensus that the Permian can continue to provide 1.5 million barrels per day of annual production growth for the foreseeable future is starting to be called into question. In this respect, we do not believe that the temporary off-day constraints are the main issue as this will largely be addressed within the next 12 to 18 months. Instead, we believe the main challenge in the Permian going forward is more likely to be reservoir and well performance as the rate of infield drilling continues to accelerate. At present, our industry has yet to understand how reservoir conditions and well productivity change as we continue to pump billions of gallons of water and billions of pounds of sand into the ground each year. However, what is already clear to us is that unit well performance normalized for lateral length and pounds of proppant pumped is dropping in the Eagle Ford as the percentage of child wells continues to increase. Today, the percentage of child wells drilled in the Eagle Ford has already reached 70% and in the 3-year period since this percentage broke the 50% level, we have seen a steady reduction in unit well productivity. In the Permian, the percentage of child wells in the Midland Wolfcamp basin has just reached 50% and we are already starting to see a similar reduction in unit well productivity to that already seen in the Eagle Ford suggesting that the Permian growth potential could be lower than earlier expected. Therefore, assuming that oil demand will remain robust despite the trade war worries and market concerns around economic weakness in the emerging markets, we believe that the level of E&P investment must increase both internationally and in North America first of all to counter the multiyear drop in investments and second to develop and deploy the new technologies needed to overcome the emerging shale oil production challenges. So, with this market outlook, why is Schlumberger best positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities? First, we have an unmatched global footprint that enables us to cost effectively pursue growth opportunities in every corner of the world. In the majority of the 120 countries where we generate revenue, we have a rich history, deep industry relations, unmatched operating infrastructure and detailed knowledge of local business conditions. Second, we have the broadest technology portfolio in the industry, where our market leadership positions enable us to compete for growth opportunities in all parts of the E&P value chain. Over the past 8 years, we have actively expanded our technology portfolio through targeted M&A activity and organic R&E investments. In the past 3 years alone, we have increased our total addressable market by 50% and we today hold market leading positions in 17 of the 20 product lines we currently operate. Third, we mastered the widest range of business models, which allows us to partner with our customers in their preferred way and this provides us with multiple avenues to increase our participation and share in markets all around the world. These models, which we have evolved over the past decade, now include equipment sales and rentals, traditional provision of standalone products and services, project coordination and bundled services, lump-sum turnkey contracts, and lastly, full field production management through our SPM models. And fourth, we lead industry in designing and engineering new high-performing technology systems spanning our entire data, software and hardware capabilities and fully leveraging the latest advantage in collaborative and digital technologies. To enable this, we last year reorganized our entire R&D effort into several distinct technology platforms, directly supporting our stated goals of pursuing the highest level of technology system performance for the benefit of our shareholders as well as for our customers. So, with our differentiated growth potential, how will Schlumberger generate the best operating and cash returns in the coming up-cycle? We already consistently deliver superior full cycle EBITDA margins and cash flow from operations compared to our competitors, and in particular in the part of the cycle where the international markets are growing. In 2014, which was the last year of growth for our international business, we generated 69% incremental margins on only 4% revenue growth with no support from pricing. In the same year, we generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, which represented a conversion rate of 83% of net income from continuing operations. This performance was driven by solid execution from our global organization and the early benefits from our transformation program. By advancing our transformation program further over the past 4 years, we have completely modernized our internal workflows and organizational structure and created stronger and more professional support functions with cutting-edge planning, execution and collaboration tools. This allows us to significantly improve the utilization and reduce the operating cost of our asset base through improved planning, distribution and maintenance. At the same time, we continue to deploy our people and expertise more effectively by applying multi-scaling and remote operations, which will allow us to reduce our annual recruiting numbers by at least 1,500 to 2,000 people in each of the coming years. These operational efficiency improvements all support our goals of delivering superior incremental margins in the coming up-cycle and at the same time lowering our need for capacity-related CapEx investments compared to previous cycles. Based on our market outlook and strengthened execution capabilities we have defined the following set of performance targets for the coming cycle. We will outgrow the market in terms of top line through our unmatched global footprint, our industry leading technology offering, a broad range of business models and the investments we are currently making into our next generation technology platforms. We will deliver 65% incremental margins driven by our modernized operating platform and the recovery of the pricing concessions we have made over the past 4 years. Our SPM business will at least be cash flow neutral in 2018 and 2019 after which we will see a significant free cash flow tailwind as our recent project additions reached their planned production rates. The CapEx requirements from our seismic business after adopting the asset-light model will be limited to specific multiclient projects, where each project we undertake continued to require a significant level of customer pre-commitment. At this stage we are not planning any M&A transactions that would involve significant cash outlay other than the pending Eurasia drilling needs, where we now have met and accepted all the requirements deflated by the Russian authorities and await their decision. These targets mean that we should meet or exceed our stated goal of converting more than 75% of our net income into pretax growth and generate an increasing amount of excess cash which we intend to return to our shareholders in the form of increased dividend and stock buyback. At present the entire Schlumberger team of 110,000 women and men are ready and primed to outperform in the market upturn that we are now entering. And through the hard work we have collectively undertaken over the past 4 years to expand our external offering and modernize our internal execution platform, we have never been better positioned to outscore the market in the coming up-cycle and to generate superior operating margins and cash returns to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning James.
Operator: His line has accidentally disconnected. We will go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning Scott.
Scott Gruber: Paal, good to hear some additional color on the transformation this morning, now your peers have programs as well, one I actually recall there is the transformation program, now when we look at peers they are reducing costs through internal programs and also through some merger synergies, but overall are you surprised by the level of cost reductions at peers? It doesn’t sound like what peers are doing changes your view on eventually achieving the very robust incrementals that you originally laid out with the transformation plan, but is it delaying the ramp in incrementals, the timing of seeing those robust incrementals via the pricing dynamics in the marketplace there?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I mean I can focus my comments on what we do. I am not really into the details of what our competitors are doing, our peers are doing internally. But we have been working on our transformation on modernization program since 2012. And it’s being a very meticulous and systematic approach to understanding what part of our operations or what in our operations can we improve in terms of both quality and efficiency. It takes time to change these type of things in a big organization that is actually functioning quite well from the get-go, but our job is to make sure that we pursue the upside potential and that’s what we have been doing. So this will translate and be a significant part of how we drive incremental margins in the coming up-cycle. Now the incremental margins are still a function of a couple of other things in addition to the transformation and one is we need growth. And secondly we have also been very clear that we need some tailwind from pricing. And if you look at this year, we have internationally very low growth, quite nominal. And at the same time we are working through some let me say crosscurrents in pricing. We are still absorbing new contracts, the pricing is actually diluted to the base price that we have through the bidding we have done over the past year. But then that was all normalized and we get a bit more consistent sequential and annual growth with a bit of help from pricing and the modernization program is going to be the real driver for us delivering on the promise of the 65% incrementals. And this is something that will evolve I would say over the coming 1 to 2 years.
Scott Gruber: Got it. What aspects of the transformation program do you think were most profound, what aspects will peers struggle to replicate that you think really gives you an edge into the next cycle?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, let me again focus on us. I mean, the most profound part of what we have done has been firstly to update the entire blueprints of all the activities we do as a company and put that together into one companywide map. When you have done that, you can start breaking down these things and streamline them in terms of how each part of the company comes together in a huge element of teamwork to drive again both the quality and efficiency of what we do. So, having a deep understanding of how everything is interconnected, you can also then start to professionalize more the individual parts – things like procurements, sourcing, transportation, these are all actually huge aspects of what drives that performance. And when you are as big as we are, I think it’s very, very smart to actually address these things with a lot more professionalism than what we have done in the past. I wouldn’t say that we have done a bad job at it, it’s just that when you are as big as we are, then there is huge opportunities to drive efficiencies and quality by further professionalizing these type of functions.
Scott Gruber: Got it. I appreciate the additional color. Thanks.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Kurt Hallead: I was just kind of curious, thanks for that color on the incremental margins and what’s going to be necessary to get there. On the interim basis, right, can you give us your perspective on how you see the North American frac market mapping out over the course of the next year or so? And then given some of the challenges, can you kind of give us some insights as to how you are kind of managing the cost dynamic and how you are trying to maximize your margins through this interim lull?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I will. So, let me focus on the next quarter and maybe the quarter after that. The North America land market is changing pretty rapidly. So how this will play up over the full course of 2019, I think it’s still a bit early to say, but let’s talk first about Q4. So, it is evident that the rapid softening we have seen both in frac activity and pricing over the I would say second half of the third quarter is continuing more or less with the same pace in Q4 and this is obviously representing challenges in terms of white spaces in the frac calendar. In addition to this which sort of further aggravates the situation is that several of our key customers have decided that they are going to lay down all their frac fleets from about middle of November and up until middle of January, which again is a fairly significant challenge in terms of how do you approach the cost base at that stage. So, what we have decided for the course of Q4 is to actively try to reduce the variable part of our cost base, but we aren’t going to do any significant adjustments to the structure, because what we see in the outlook for hydraulic fracs is that there is going to be a couple of quarters where there will be lower activity, but this is more of a pause than I would say a long-term structural issue. Whether this is Q4, Q1 or it lingers into Q2 I think is to be seen, but we will do what we can to manage the variable cost, but we aren’t going to take any significant actions or charges or anything like that when it comes to our structural setup in the market. We are committed to this market and we have a very good position, both in the frac services and also, as Patrick alluded to, on the vertical integration through the entire sand value chain. So, you are going to have to absorb some of the headwinds from the costs that we choose not to do anything with in the next couple of quarters, but beyond that, we are going to continue to leverage our strong position in the market following that.
Kurt Hallead: That’s great. And then I have a follow-up for you then in that context. Do you think that over the course of the next few quarters that the momentum that you have in the international market will be enough to offset the weakness in North America?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, let’s be specific on Q4 to take that first. I mean, if you look at international markets in Q4, we expect flattish revenues. There is a few moving parts on that, that leads to it. There is no change to our outlook on the international market and the momentum we have seen in the past couple of quarters we expect to continue into 2019 and we are still very confident about the north of 10% revenue growth for our business internationally in 2019. But for Q4, we do see sequential growth in EMEA, but this is going to be offset by the normal winter slowdown in Russia and the North Sea and Latin America is going to be flat and we don’t see any significant year end sales this year, mainly because I don’t think our customers have budgeted for that. So, international, both on revenue and earnings, we see as relatively flat with Q3. Now, based on what I just said on North America land, our earnings from North America land and our revenue will be down in Q4, so EPS sequentially is going to come down, I think how much, I am not going to give a specific number; I think it’s going to be a function of how severe the shutdowns are going to be in November and December, but in a normalized kind of outlook for going into next year, I would still believe that the strength of the international going forward beyond Q4 should outweigh any further challenges that we have in North America land.
Kurt Hallead: That’s great color. Thanks, Paal. Appreciate it.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we will go to the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jud Bailey: Thank you. Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Jud Bailey: Paal, I wonder if I could just follow-up on one of your comments from the prior question on international growth for next year, still confident in 10% plus growth. Could you maybe give us some insight as to what you are seeing maybe the difference in what you are seeing from your IOC customers versus NOCs and maybe from a regional standpoint, how you kind of see any difference in growth between kind of those customers and market segments?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So like I said, we are still very much committed and clear on double-digit revenue growth internationally for us next year. Looking at it from a customer base standpoint, the growth will be driven by the NOCs and the international independents and I would say less so at least from where we stand and what we can see today from the IOCs. I do expect at some stage that the IOCs will potentially open up a bit more in terms of their investment levels as well, but at present, next year’s growth, the way we have it on the board is going to be driven more by the NOCs and the international independents. And if I look at where the growth will come from percentage wise, we still see the areas that have been the most compressed since 2014 that is going to have the highest percentage growth and that’s still Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, still expect to see solid growth in the other areas, but North Sea, Russia and the Middle East will probably be lower in percentage growth, but overall, double-digit revenue growth for us. We are still quite confident with it.
Jud Bailey: Okay, great. Thank you for that. And my follow-up is, is maybe if you could give us a little more color on your thoughts on the offshore market kind of broadly. You mentioned in your comments and Patrick did as well on some of the positive things we are seeing offshore both with Cameron and other parts of the business. Maybe if you can maybe talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of maybe deepwater versus shallow and just some more general market color there would be great?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So, if you look at the offshore market, I think what’s going to come back first is still going to be shallow. And I think we are starting to see movement on shallow water both drilling activity as well as on rig rates, and obviously, rig rates for us are key, because our differentiated technology increases in value proportionally to the increases in the drilling rates, right. So, this is a very good indicator for us both in terms of effective pricing as well as activities. But as Patrick alluded to offshore, we see starting good signs of higher drilling activity in particular on shallow water, but it’s actually there is a little bit of movement on deepwater as well. We expect in 2018 deepwater drilling activity to be up about 8% versus 2017 obviously from a low base, but I think it’s moving in the right direction and we expect this trend to continue into 2019. So, drilling, we are already starting to see some movement and from the subsea or SPF standpoint also increasing amounts of tiebacks and more activity coming into the subsea arena. So, we are quite focused and we are quite upbeat about what’s happening in subsea at this stage.
Jud Bailey: Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Thank you. Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Sean Meakim: So, on the international cycle, just we talk a lot about capacity getting tight here by year end and thinking about a little more elaboration around which product service lines and/or geomarkets are already fairly tight and which do you think you will still have some more slack into next year, just thinking about that progression and the consistency which you think you will see pricing power come to fruition next year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. In terms of product lines, I would say where we are. We don’t have a lot of spare capacity in any of them, but it won’t that we will I think be out of capacity first, it’s going to be everything related to drilling and broadening that, the other product lines that we have as part of our lump-sum turnkey projects as well, so that includes part of our services, part of wireline, part of testing, which are all contributing to these type of projects. So, a pretty broad-based drive on our capacity we have seen in the past couple of quarters and that’s why there is no one I would say product line that stands out, maybe drilling and measurements and their high-end technologies given the fact that we have a strong pull on that internationally, but also in North America land. So if anything, I would say high-end technologies from drilling and measurements is probably the one that is in the highest demand, but I would say it has been a pretty good pull on our broad-based capacity for most of the product lines related to well site activity. As to where the growth is coming from, it’s back to what I said earlier. The highest percentage growth we have seen in the most compressed area, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, we have over the past 12 months or so, steadily redeployed capacity to make sure we have an ideal setup of capacity where the growth is going to come, but in terms of pricing, it is probably likely to say that Latin America, sub-Sahara and Asia is where we would get pricing maybe stronger than in the other regions given the stability of activity we have had over the past couple of years.
Sean Meakim: Got it. Thank you for that. That’s very helpful. And then on Cameron, I was curious if we could get a little more update on how the customer uptake has been to the enhanced JV with Subsea 7? I am just curious if the Katmai award from Fieldwood, if that was at all influenced by some of the changes there or maybe that project was already a bit far along. I was looking to see your thoughts on how that enhanced relationship is progressing with customers?
Paal Kibsgaard: Patrick, you want to take that?
Patrick Schorn: Yes, just I will make some general comments around the JV, but also around Cameron. Clearly, with the majority of the work that we do today around feed and the comment that Paal was making that quite a bit of it is actually related to tiebacks, there is a tremendous amount of engineering work being done that benefits from the cooperation that we have in the JV. So, there is clearly value there that we are very pleased to see. I will refrain from making specific comments on whatever contracts they are working on, but we are quite happy with the type of cooperation and the action that we are seeing in that relationship. Just to give you maybe a bit of an idea of what’s happening with the rest of Cameron, so the book-to-bill ratio was over 1 for the full Cameron in Q3 and actually, it was well over 1 for service drilling and V&M for the fourth consecutive quarter. Of course, booking orders for OneSubsea were flat and the total revenue of OneSubsea is actually down 3% year-on-year. Total Cameron revenue flat sequentially and flat year-on-year, but clearly, the long-cycle businesses are down 5%, but seeing what the short-cycle businesses are doing, it’s up 12% and this is mainly driven by North America land. On the margin side, Cameron is down 140 basis points sequentially and down 350 basis points year-on-year, but noteworthy is that Q3 short-cycle business margins are greater than the long-cycle business margins for the first time in this cycle. So clearly, there are some good things happening there, maybe not in the traditional part of the OneSubsea yet, but clearly the other businesses are picking up as we go. I will leave it at that.
Sean Meakim: Fair enough. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next, we have a question from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Good morning. Paal, thanks for the color on Q4. I am just curious with regard to Q1, can you comment, I mean typically we see sequential weakness and seasonally less internationally, do you think that’s inline with historical norms at this stage or is it a little bit less threatening given the absence of product sales for Q4?
Paal Kibsgaard: To be honest with you Bill, we don’t – you don’t have a lot of visibility as of yet on Q1 in terms of those type of details. But I would agree with your kind of high level analysis that with less, yes year on product sales, the sequential impact Q4 to Q1 should be somewhat bumping. That I would agree with. But we have – we always had a view on next year, we have high level view of how the market is shaping up. We have been run into kind of the detail analysis of Q4 – sorry Q1. We will do that during the course of the coming quarter. But I agree with you that the absence of year-end sales should ideally dampen some of the sequential drops that we typically see in Q1.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And Simon a question for you with regard to cash flow and cash balances. Cash flow was much incurred in Q3 with your cash balances, keep leaning lower and so I guess the question is the required amount of cash on hand to run the business and what do you expect the cash outflow to be for Eurasia when that happens?
Simon Ayat: So as you know that Q3 was the pretty good performance cash wise. We typically see that kind of a performance during the second half that should continue into Q4 actually. The cash outflow for Eurasia we already as you know this has been long presence, so this plant that Eurasia is going to come with it’s own cash flow and it’s on strong EBITDA actually. So we are – we will fund this through additional borrowing. The cash on hand we have today is still 0.9 and we continued to be at base level and this was the comfort level I like to keep or we like to keep for the company. So as I said before for Eurasia we will fund it when it gets approved through more borrowing and we will see how the final transaction format and structure will be at that time. But just worth noting that the cash generation in the second half will be like every year, stronger than the first half and we should be back on target by the end of the year.
Bill Herbert: Alright. So you want to quantify it’s going markedly lower from current levels?
Paal Kibsgaard: Sorry, it’s a bit difficult to hear you, can you repeat question?
Bill Herbert: Sorry you don’t see cash balances going markedly lower from current levels?
Simon Ayat: Well, I am not ready. I mean our Q4 cash outlays are already planned and the cash generation, we don’t see a drop right now.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Thanks very much.
Simon Ayat: Thank you.
Operator: Next we have a question from James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
James Wicklund: Good morning guys. Labor, I noticed that your severance charges this quarter were up from Q2 and Q1 and so I am curious to know where those severance charges here are and in contrast of against what we are hearing about the tightness of labor onshore U.S. was some people expecting labor inflation of 10% to 15% in 2019, can you talk a little bit about your workforce and your personnel where these severance charges are, why they keep ramping up, when do they peak and what do you say for in U.S. labor inflation?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, alright. So the outlay we had on severance in Q2 is basically the implementation of the reductions we did earlier this year associated with the lost step and the change of the organization. So this is not something new. In certain jurisdictions, there is a bit of time needed from the notification of the individuals we have to let go and feel that is implemented. And just reflecting the cash payments or that charge that we took earlier this year associated with that organization. So, beyond that, there is no continuous charges or outlays we have on severance, it is all linked to that one bigger thing we did earlier this year with a bit of lingering in the implementation due to local labor laws.
James Wicklund: Okay, that’s helpful. And onshore U.S. expectations?
Paal Kibsgaard: Onshore U.S., it is a tight market obviously for the coming quarter or two. On the frac side, there is lower activity in which case some of the crews that we have operating today we will need to temporarily lay down and the way we do that, we look at these things individually whether we have to lay people off or we can try to furlough or try to bridge it in other ways with respect to the other businesses we have in U.S. land. So, this is what our operating people are looking at on a daily basis to try to minimize the impact on our individual employees. And at the same time, I would say maximizing our ability to ramp back up quickly again both in time and in terms of quality. So, it’s a balancing act and this is just the nature of the very dynamic U.S. land market and that’s something we are used to dealing with and we are dealing with as best we can. But, you are right directionally, that it’s a tight labor market in U.S. land and actually the only thing that’s impacted really in terms of both activity and pricing at this stage is frac. The drilling business and our lift business is more or less unaffected by the softening or these off-take constraints. It’s the frac that is the main driver. So, we are going to be managing this, Jim, as best we can and it’s just another curveball that we need to deal with and that’s what we do for a living.
James Wicklund: My follow-up if I could, you noticed Latin America was up well in Q3 and then you commented that it will probably be flat in Q4. On Q2, you talked about how Latin America and other places would have to recover in ‘19 to get the total global international growth we expect. Can you talk about your expectations for Latin America in ‘19 as we sit here today? And before we get cutoff, I want to thank you for helping reestablish, resetting the bar for expectations going forward, so investors can have a better idea of what we can earn in this business if the world in, so, thank you on that. But, Latin America, what’s your outlook for ‘19?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, thanks for that, Jim. Latin America for next year will be solid. I think like I said earlier, Latin America, sub-Sahara and Asia are the ones that we still have seen the largest revenue compression. There has actually been a couple of quarters now with quite decent sequential growth in Latin America. Due to mix and just various ways things are panning out, it’s going to be flattish in Q4, but it doesn’t change our view for ‘19. I think we are looking at solid year-over-year growth again in Latin America in 2019.
James Wicklund: Excellent. Thank you guys very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning. Paal, I guess a question about your U.S. customers and their outlook for 2019, have you had any discussions about 2019 yet with the U.S. customers? And I realized in the near-term, you have got the Permian bottlenecks, but are you starting to see kind of accelerated activity in other basins outside the Permian yet?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, we have not seen any major shift in the activity projections for the other basins. So, I think that’s going to be continuing along the path that we already had established whether this is the Northeast Bakken, Haynesville or Eagle Ford. So, no real change to that. And I think the interactions we have with customers around the Permian is that there is still a very positive outlook. The growth we have seen production wise over the past couple of years was almost bound at some stage to kind of hit the infrastructure constraints and I think the industry there is very active in de-bottlenecking both the infrastructure when it comes to pricing, but it’s a lot of other challenges that we have as an industry in the Permian region from all sorts of infrastructure, which we are obviously participating in those discussions. So, although there is going to be a couple of quarters with the challenges there, I think the overall customer sentiment on the Permian is quite upbeat and we are also committed to them and to the activity in the region, right. But we are just going to have to manage now the next couple of quarters. And I think there are three dimensions of infrastructure challenges. It’s oil or crude, which I think will be addressed the first, but there is also challenges around gas off-take and NGLs, which also is going to have to be addressed right and the industry is working on all three aspects.
Chase Mulvehill: That’s very helpful. Appreciate the color. The follow-up, you talked about U.S. shale production and the challenges around that that you are starting to see. These challenges – is this something that can be solved through technology or is this just reservoir challenges that we have to deal with?
Paal Kibsgaard: No. I think it can absolutely be solved through technology. A lot of this has to do with the conformity of the frac to make sure that we frac every cluster that we perforate and we have diverse technologies that we have been promoting to the market for several years with some off-take, but I think this is likely to accelerate and it’s also about how you ensure that your frac stays within the allocated rough volume that you have for the well, which is more of a far-field conformance that you are looking for and we have technologies in terms of how we design the frac fluid to address that too. So, all of these things I believe are addressable, but it requires a bit more of a reservoir focus on how the wells are drilled, how the wells are fracked, and we need a little bit more data to make sure that we do the right things here. But the measurements are available, the analysis and interpretation of the measurements are available and the remedies that we need to do to the frac fluids are also available. It’s just a matter of adopting these technologies. We have them all ready to go.
Chase Mulvehill: Awesome. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hey, good morning. Paal, I was wondering if you can just kind of walk us through some of the LSTK projects and how they are ramping up in the Middle East. Do you think by the year end of this year that you will get all of those costs absorbed – all startup costs absorbed and as we progress kind of the next couple of years of these projects, how should we think about kind of revenue and margin? Should revenue be largely flattish the next few years with margins continuing to pickup? I was just wondering if you just kind of help us walk through how to think about these projects as they move through?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I mean, we have integrated drilling projects, of which LSTK is one of the business models of it. We have project of this ramping up in many parts of the world. You rightfully allude to the Middle East, where a lot of them are happening. We have these types of projects in Saudi Arabia, in the Emirates, Iraq, India we will be probably starting up soon in Kuwait. So, there is a lot of activity along this business model, which we like, because we are entirely in charge of our own destiny. So if we drill better, if we outperform what the norm is in the market, we benefit our customer and at the same time, we are able to drive our margins up. So, to your questions about the ramp, it’s been a big ramp for us this year, which we are happy to take going one way, because it means we won a lot of work, but at the same time, it impacts the incremental margins and the cost base, but I would say that by the end of this year, these projects should be fully mobilized, the cost should be absorbed and we should have a very, very good platform for growth in all these areas as we go into 2019. So, I would expect 2019 for sure to be up in terms of IDS or integrated drilling services revenues and the margins should start to come up as well. We have both the benefit of less mobilization cost, but also as we get quickly off the learning curve on these projects, that again is going to further give us tailwinds on margins. So, I think you will see very strong growth for our integrated drilling business in 2019 and we expect that to continue into 2020 with a steady improvement in margins as we go along.
David Anderson: Paal kind of a separate subject turning gears to the North America, I was wondering if you could just talk, expand a little bit more about your strategy regarding sand and proppant in the U.S. land market. My understanding is you acquired another Permian sand mine during the quarter? And then you talked about third-party sales during the quarter. Can you just kind of talk about, I mean, I would assume a big part of this is to ensure your supply chain for kind of maximizing utilization on your pressure pumping, but what else is this for? Is this also a strategy to kind of add more revenue in from North America markets? Can you just kind of expand a little bit on kind of how last mile solutions might fit into this? I know you have some of that, but is that something you think you need to expand out as well just kind of your overall strategy regarding sand in North America, please?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, that’s fine. That’s a good question, Dave. So, we started on this about 3 years ago in terms of investments. And our view at the time was that to further improve full cycle returns in this market, we wanted to have part of our sand value chain internally sourced. The main reason for that is that in the up-cycle, there is always a massive inflation in both the sand cost at the gates of the mine, rail, transloading, and trucking. So we decided at the starting point that we wanted to internalize part of this, because that would significantly reduce our cost base in the upturn and these things are easily mothballed in the downturn as well. So, if we chose to actually buy it off the market entirely in the downturn, where certain players are willing to sell it probably below cost, that would be one contributor to driving full cycle margins. Now, since then we have seen an emerging trend from our customers, who have also seen that there is a lot of inflation in this part of the value chain to the point that are starting to break at the way they bid the frac work up into individual products as well as services. This has always been integrated in the past, where the frac company is the one that basically handles the supply chain for sand. But at an increasing pace, we see a separation of sand and service in terms of how the work is bid out. So, in this process, we have stepped up a bit further, our investments into the value chain to the point that we are now pretty much self-sufficient. On sand, we have a pretty good fleet when it comes to last mile and we have also bought mines which are fairly closely associated with where we do most of our activity. So, we have a couple of mines in West Texas, in particular, which is very, very key for our operations there. So, what started off to kind of drive full cycle margin has now kind of played into our favor into a major industry trend, which is the separation of sand and services in the frac market. So, we have done this through organic investments. I think we have made some very good deals in the process. We don’t have anymore sand mines that we are looking to buy at this stage. We are where we need to be. So the vertical integration is done and we see now the opportunity, like I said, obviously, first of all to supply our OneStim frac business with very competitive costs for sand, but at the same time, there is now a flurry of individual sand bids which we can also participate in using the investments and the capacity that we have already sunk in. But we have no plans on investing further into this. We have done the investments. We have done them I think at the right time. And we kind of saw that industry trend coming and that’s what we are now benefiting from.
David Anderson: Great. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you very much. Okay, that concludes today’s call. Thank you very much for listening in.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning. Good afternoon. And welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2018 earnings call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris, France following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, Wells. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we'll open up for questions. For today's agenda, Simon will present comments on our second quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and an updated view of the industry macro. However, before we begin, I'd like to remind our participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you at our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details on reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll hand the call over to Simon Ayat.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.43. This represents an increase of $0.05 sequentially and up $0.08 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the second quarter, we recorded $0.12 of severance charges. Our second quarter revenue of $8.3 billion increased 6% sequentially, largely driven by the growth in OneStim in North America and higher reservoir characterization and drilling activity internationally. Pretax operating margins increased by 75 basis points to 13%. Highlights by product group were as follows. Second quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.6 billion increased 5% sequentially, primarily due to higher wireline activity in offshore North America, further progress on OneSurface integrated production system projects and increased SIS sales internationally. Margins increased 166 basis points to 21.4%, primarily driven by the recovery of higher margin wireline activity and stronger SIS software sales. Drilling revenue of $2.2 billion increased 5% sequentially, while margins decreased 83 basis points to 12.9%. The revenue increase was primarily driven by strong international drilling activity as a result of the start of integrated drilling projects. Margin was negatively impacted by startup costs associated with new projects as well as operational delays. Production revenue of $3.3 billion increased 10% sequentially and margins increased by 239 basis points to 9.7%. These results were primarily driven by OneStim growth in North America combined with higher activity in the Middle East and Asia area. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 1% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by declining project volumes in OneSubsea, which were partially offset by higher sales for surface systems and valve and measurements in North America. Margins were essentially flat at 12.8%. The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle business was at 1.  Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 17.2% in the second quarter compared to 17.6% in the previous quarter.  Looking forward, the ETR will be sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. As a result of the continued recovery in North America, we anticipate that the ETR will increase next quarter and over the remainder of the year. We generated $1 billion of cash flow from operations during the quarter. Our net debt increased $600 million during the quarter to $14.6 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $3 billion. During the quarter, we spent $103 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $68.45. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $520 million and capitalized cost relating to SPM projects of $194 million. During the quarter, we also made $693 million of dividend payments. Full-year 2018 CapEx excluding SBM and multiclient investments is still expected to be approximately $2 billion. And now, I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.
Patrick Schorn : Thank you, Simon. And good morning, everyone. In my comments today, I will first discuss revenue growth by geography without Cameron and then conclude with some Cameron-specific remarks on second quarter performance. Looking at our results in North America, revenue increased 12% sequentially. Or more precisely, revenue grew by 9% on land and by 22% offshore. The land revenue increase outperformed both the 7% increase in the US land rig count and the 8% improvement in the US land frac market stage count. In Canada, activity dropped as expected as the spring breakup took effect. Offshore revenue grew due to market share gains in the well construction arena. Multiclient seismic license sales were also higher as we continued to focus on the new asset-light model at WesternGeco.  OneStim pressure pumping revenue grew by 17%, driven by the deployment of additional frac fleets. Net pricing remained stable as increasing capacity across the market matched increasing customer activity. We were also able to leverage the improved efficiency of our operations to grow revenue and gain market share. in particular, the investments in vertical integration supporting our pressure pumping operations has allowed us to respond rapidly to the increasing customer trend of separating pumping services from sand supply. This means that we're able to bid competitively on both integrated or standalone sand supply contracts to participate in the full revenue potential of each, particularly as we add more capability in sand supply on a regional basis. In the US land drilling market, activity was also strong with a growing customer interest in integrated well construction services, while demand also remained robust for rotary steerable systems. Based on industry figures, the average length of laterals have increased by 30% over the past four years and new well designs that balance lateral length with optimized stimulated reservoir volume to maximize productivity and manage cost continue to be tested. This approach is evident in SBM projects as well. The Palliser asset in Alberta, for example, restarted drilling activity after the breakup in June, initially with one rig, before quickly ramping back up to four rigs in early July. Drilling technologies have been key to increasing performance here. PeriScope mapping service was combined with the PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable system to enable drilling within a thin pay zone in three wells. A 100% reservoir contact was achieved in the same pay zones, which exceeds the previous reservoir contact of 85% to 90% in offset wells. In addition, PowerDrive Orbit enabled a higher ROP than wells drilled by others and also achieved the longest lateral level drilled on this asset at a length of 4,244 meters. Turning now to our international business, second quarter revenue, excluding Cameron, increased 6% sequentially as we responded to the challenges of mobilizing 29 rigs for new integrated drilling projects simultaneously in various geographies. With the commissioning of the newbuild rigs in places and the reactivation of stacked equipment in others, startup costs and operational delays impacted our financial performance in the quarter. In Latin America, revenue increased 3% sequentially. In the Mexico and Central America geo market, additional rigs mobilized for an integrated drilling services contract on land, while work over and production services also experienced increased activity. In the Latin America South geo market, activity strengthened with projects restarting in Brazil and increased hydraulic fracturing and coiled tubing activity on an unconventional land SBM project in Argentina. In Latin America North, activity was stronger in Colombia, while revenue was sequentially flat in Ecuador due to operational delays. Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa, across the product lines, excluding Cameron, increased 5% as drilling activity in the North Sea and Europe recovered from the winter slowdowns. This activity increase was concentrated around development work in the UK in addition to exploration activity in Norway after recent Equinor contract awards. Drilling activity was also higher in Continental Europe and, in particular, in Romania.  Revenue in Russia was essentially flat sequentially due to delays in the startup of summer offshore campaigns, while land drilling activity remains solid. Revenue in sub-Saharan Africa increased with the start of new projects in Angola, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Cameroon with well intervention activity accelerating and development work resuming in response to higher crude prices. The North Africa geo market benefited from solid activity in Libya despite a challenging security environment and from integrated services activity in Chad. Middle East and Asia revenue, excluding Cameron, increased 7% led by the Far East and Australia geo market. In the northern Middle East geo market, good progress was made on OneSurface production projects in Kuwait and Egypt, while the Eastern Middle East geo market benefited from the startup of integrated drilling projects in Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, an additional 8 rigs have now been mobilized for lump-sum turnkey work on the Ghawar Field, with limited revenue growth in the quarter due to delays and logistical challenges in the startup phase of the project. In Asia, growth in the Far East and Australia geo market was due mainly to increased activity in Indonesia and offshore Australia, while China benefited from a ramp up in activity for shale gas and tight oil plays, including first gas production on a China SBM project. In Southeast Asia geo market, operations began on drilling projects in Myanmar, Vietnam and India despite some startup inefficiencies. Southeast Asia experienced also some delays in Malaysia, although work on recently awarded contracts is strengthening as we move into Q3. Last, let me turn to Cameron where increased revenue for Surface Systems and Valves & Measurements was more than offset by lower project backlog at OneSubsea. Revenue declined 1% sequentially as a result. Geographically, the revenue growth in North America and Latin America was more than offset by weaker revenue in the Middle East and Asia, while Europe, CIS and Africa remained flat sequentially. Beyond the numbers, I would like to highlight a series of contract awards that point to anticipation of more offshore activity restarts. For example, awards by Transocean marked the sale of the seventh new Cameron managed pressure drilling system. In addition, we extended existing service contracts to cover maintenance and service on BOP systems on 13 of Transocean ultra-deepwater and harsh environment fleet, as well as an order for a complete drilling package for deployment on a newbuild rate for service in the Caspian Sea. These orders support our view that the broad-based recovery is now also reaching the offshore market where drilling contractors are beginning to order equipment to upgrade rigs in anticipation of increased activity. And with that, let me pass the call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard : Thank you, Patrick. And good morning, everyone. The broad-based recovery in the international markets has now finally started, which led us to recover sequential revenue growth in almost all geo markets and nearly product lines in the second quarter. One of our many growth drivers in the emerging international upcycle is our integrated drilling business where we, through our systematic R&D investments and domain leadership in drilling hardware, fluids, software, have created a highly-differentiated well construction platform which today enables us to win most of the tendered work, while at the same time delivers solid financial returns. Our tender win rates and backlog increase for integrated drilling projects over the past year is the highest we have ever seen. And based on these project wins, we will, in 2018, mobilize a total of 90 land rigs, mostly third-party, which by itself is equivalent to a midsize line drilling contractor. In the integrated drilling business, the reduction of interfaces and improved definition of responsibilities between our customers and us create significant improvements in both quality and efficiency that benefit both parties. At the same time, the performance-based contracting model and the increased freedom we get to optimize drilling plans, select the appropriate technologies and continuously innovate in the way we run our operations create additional value which is shared with our customers. One example of the operational innovations we are currently deploying on all our new drilling projects is multi-skilling and remote operations, which allow us to reduce the overall headcount on the rig site by up to 35%. Another example of operational innovation is how we are rapidly increasing the utilization of our operating assets through our global traceability system, our centralized planning centers, a more scientific methodology for equipment maintenance and our unique data-driven drilling optimization software. As a result, our drilling and measurement product line is, for instance, on track to double the asset utilization of our globally sold-out rotary steerable fleet over the course of 2018 alone, which helps improve the financial returns and reduce the level of current and future CapEx investments. Still, the ongoing mobilization of all the services needed for our new integrated drilling project will leave us with no spare equipment capacity by the end of 2018.  In anticipation of this pending capacity shortage, we have already started to engage in pricing discussions with many of our customers, which will allow us to invest in additional capacity and it would allow our customers to secure this capacity in return for improved commercial terms. In North America land, we continue to deploy additional fracturing fleets during the second quarter, while pricing stayed flat as industry capacity additions matched the growth in customer activity. Although the rate of permitting and the overall activity levels remain high, the takeaway constraints in the Permian could temper the activity growth over the coming quarters, which is something we will monitor closely going forward. During the second quarter, we completed a very important milestone in our transformation program with the successful rollout of our new and streamlined field organization just in time for the emerging international upturn. This milestone caps six years of methodical investment into a new blueprint for our field operation workflows and organizational structure, including stronger and more professional functions, all equipped with cutting-edge planning, execution and collaboration tools. The need to modernize our operating platform was clearly identified as far back as the late 1990s, but due to the technical complexity and the associated change management challenges, it was left unaddressed until 2012 when we launched our corporate transformation program. Our modernized field operations and support organizations will, going forward, set new standards for internal efficiency, quality and teamwork, which will lower our need for capacity-related CapEx investments compared to previous cycles and, at the same time, support our promise of delivering 65% incremental margins in the coming upcycle. As part of this transformation milestone, we also completed the second and last step in the simplification of our management structure, which will improve our agility and competitiveness and further lower our support costs. This was the basis for the headcount related charge we took in the second quarter, as outlined by Simon. Next, I would like to update you on the global oil market and how we see the oil selectivity unfolding in the coming quarters. The fundamentals of the global oil market continue to evolve favorably for our international business as the balance of crude oil supply and demand tightens further. Global GDP growth remains robust and oil demand growth was strong in the first half of this year, helped by cold weather in the northern hemisphere. Despite the increase in crude prices, the reporting agencies have not made any changes to their global oil demand forecasts, which still stands at 1.4 million barrels per day for both 2018 and 2019, while we await further clarity around any potential demand headwinds from the ongoing US-China trade dispute. In spite OPEC's recent decision to increase oil production, the supply base continues to weaken, with growing geopolitical pressure to remove Iranian barrels from the market, with no apparent resolution to the falling production in Venezuela, and with Libyan exports continuing to be volatile. At present, OPEC spare production capacity is limited to 2.1 million barrels per day from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, which is approaching the lowest levels seen in the last two decades. In North America, the pressure on infrastructure and export pipeline capacity from the Permian Basin is becoming an increasing constraint to production growth, which will likely not be resolved until the second half of 2019. The USA shale producers are also experiencing production challenges linked in part to well interference as infill drilling in the producing acreage increases and as drilling continues to step out from the tier 1 acreage. And lastly, after more than three years of E&P underinvestment, the international production base has started to show accelerating signs of weakness with noticeable year-over-year production declines in 15 of the world's producing countries. These developments underline the growing need for increased E&P spending in particular in the international markets as it is becoming apparent that the new projects coming online over the next few years will likely not be sufficient to meet the increasing demand. Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect the broader-based international recovery to continue with sequential growth driven by Russia, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, while we expect more nominal sequential growth in Europe and Africa. In North America land, we do not presently see any impact on the established activity outlook and we plan to continue to deploy additional fracturing and drilling capacity, while we closely monitor the evolution of the market, ready to adjust as needed. Due to its nature, the backlog-driven business of Cameron has a cycle lag compared to our well-related product lines. However, the reduction in backlog for the long cycle businesses is starting to slow, while the short cycle product lines are responding well to the recovery in both the North American and international markets. Overall, for the third quarter, we expect a similar rate of sequential revenue growth to what we saw in the second quarter with a corresponding EPS growth that should again be in the range of 10% to 15% as we complete the major mobilizations for our new drilling projects. These numbers further assume a quick recovery from the offshore strike in Norway and the unrest we are currently seeing in the Basra region of Iraq, which have both impacted our operations in July. Over the past four years, we have been opportunistic and expanding our offering to our targeted M&A program and our corresponding R&D investments, which has allowed us to increase our total addressable market by 50%. Our broad and industry-leading technology offering, together with our unmatched geographical footprint and our fully modernized operating platform, make a very powerful combination that puts us firmly in the driver's seat to outperform in the coming global upturn. And on that note, the entire Schlumberger team of 100,000 women and men are ready and primed to capture the growth opportunities coming from the positive market fundamentals we are now seeing. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up for questions. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good afternoon, Paal. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Hey, good morning, James.
James West: So, it looks like, from my standpoint, 2018, you talked about 90 land rigs being mobilized, with the 28 last quarter. Offshore, starting to kick in. You're talking back about your 65% incrementals at some point here when we get pricing. Could you maybe give us an idea of what regions of the world – I mean, obviously, good growth in Asia and Australia this quarter and continued growth in the Middle East. What regions of the world – or is it just everywhere – that's starting to inflect? This is a big inflection for international.
Paal Kibsgaard: I agree with you. It is a big inflection for international. And I would say that we are basically seeing it everywhere. We're not going to see the same sequential growth rates from every region in every quarter.
James West: Sure.
Paal Kibsgaard: And while Russia and the Middle East was a little bit slower and sequential growth, this quarter, we're seeing them right back with strong performance anticipated for Q3. Asia continues to be strong again for the second quarter in a row. And Latin America, which we only had about 3% sequential growth in Q2, is going to be a lot stronger again in Q3. So, we are basically seeing new activity, new products being discussed, more activity on the existing products we have in pretty much every corner of the world. It's not going to be a straight line for each of the regions, but we are very encouraged with what we see.  We have, with the management team being a lot in the field during the second quarter, seen a lot of our customers. And, overall, the mood is actually quite upbeat, which is quite a while since we have seen this on our field visits.
James West: Sure. Absolutely. And then, with respect to pricing, it sounds like you've got a little bit in 2Q or maybe some smaller contracts, but the discussion about the absorption of all your equipment by year-end, is that already a done deal based on contract awards that have already come through?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. That's pretty much a done deal. That's basically mobilizing and honoring the commitments that we have already taken on. So, yeah, I would say, during the course of the fourth quarter of this year, we will be, I would say, fully utilized in the international markets. And beyond that, we will look at adding capacity partly through CapEx, but also a fair bit through driving the efficiency of our asset base that we have in place, now further helped by the upgrade we've done to our field organization. But during the fourth quarter, we will be fully mobilized. And we have already started these pricing discussions with our customers. Part of it is going to be price book uplift. Part of it will be potentially better terms and conditions. And, in particular, also payment terms. We are still, I would say, not really satisfied with the evolution of our working capital and this is mainly down to slow payments from our customers, which we are actively looking to address.
James West: Got it. Good luck. Thanks a lot.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks, James. Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS Securities. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Angie Sedita: So, nice to hear the enthusiasm on the international side. It certainly feels more tangible than it has in sometime. So, maybe you could talk a little bit about some of your integrated project awards. I think that was a key factor in where you see it as absorption and capacity and how that plays into pricing. And then, I know it's early, but maybe you had some early thoughts on international E&P spend for 2019. Is low double-digits a stretch or is that a possibility?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah, okay. On the first part of your question in terms of the areas of international, as we discussed with James, we see it generally everywhere at this stage at varying rates. But in terms of the drilling projects, we also see them in most regions, right? Obviously, on land for lump-sum turnkey, we see that in Latin America, very much so in the Middle East and also some in Asia. And we also have integrated projects more from a project coordination standpoint happening on land, but also now occurring in the shallow water where – offshore where we also are starting to see an uptick in activity. So, overall, it's quite exciting. It's been a while since we were able to kind of talk as optimistically about the international market as we can now. So, it's all positive. Now, to your question on 2019, it's obviously early for us to make predictions about what our customers are going to do. I don't think they have really started their planning exercises yet. But, obviously, we have a pretty good handle on our revenue backlog from all the project wins we have and the outlook generally we have on our business. And I can at least say from our standpoint that our growth in international for next year will be double-digit. Don't ask me where in double-digits, but it's going to be double-digits.
Angie Sedita: Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. And then, going to North America and the Permian, you made a little comment here on your deployments. So, maybe talk a little bit further about OneStim and the deployment for the rest of 2018 and going into 2019. And also, very interesting on the sand strategy with the vertical integration, your commentary by your customers and should we expect further integration into sand. So, maybe a little bit on OneStim and then on sand.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. On OneStim, we had continued to deploy our spare equipment. And we basically said that, by the end of this year, we will be in a position to have deployed it all. We will do whatever rebuild is necessary and that's currently ongoing. It's progressing well. And we continue to deploy now into the third quarter. We are aware of the emerging Permian takeaway constraints, but we have yet to see any real impact on the activity growth or any activity on pricing. So, we are continuing to deploy and things are progressing well with OneStim. Now, as for the vertical integration, we have been investing into this now for about three years and we now own several sand mines. And our investment into sand mines will be concluded basically this month. We will then have sufficient sand mine capacity to take care of 100% of our current and also projected frac work.  We see this as a significant competitive advantage going forward because there is a quickly growing trend from our customers now to separate the tendering for frac services and frac sand.  And through the investments we've done and vertical integration, all the way from the sand mine to the rail, to transload and also trucking for the last mile where we have vertically integrated all aspects of this, not for 100% of our capacity, but for a fairly significant part, that allows us now to bit very competitively for the standalone sand tenders, which means that we can obviously compete in the entire revenue stream continuously, which would have been a lot more difficult in the event we were not vertically integrated. So, we are basically done this month with our vertical integration investment program and we're now in a prime position to really take advantage of that and continue the deployment of the remaining spare frac capacity we have by the end of the year.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Very helpful. I'll turn it over. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you. Thanks, Angie.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Thank you. Paal, can you discuss the outlook for the drilling segment, both revenues and margins in the second half? You mentioned double-digit growth internationally next year. Will the double-digit growth start to manifest within drilling in the second half just given all the rig deployments? And then, as the startup costs fade, how should we think about the margin trajectory within drilling?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. So, I would say the double-digit growth was an overall Schlumberger international projection for next year. For the second half of this year, I gave some indications around how we see Q3. And, obviously, given the significance of these integrated drilling contracts, we expect significant growth within the context of the overall growth from the drilling group. There's been a heavy mobilization burden on them in the first half of the year. It will continue into, for sure, Q3, and that has impacted margins. We're not, obviously, happy with that level of margin, but we also understand that there are challenges with these type of deployments, right? So, you can expect, going forward into the second half, that both margins will improve and we also would expect that the drilling group will be in the high-end of our sequential growth as we go into the third quarter.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And while we're on the forward outlook, consensus currently stands at $0.51 according to FactSet for 3Q, are you comfortable with that figure, given the trends you see today?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well as I said in my prepared remarks, our view in the third quarter is that we will again grow roughly on the top line at the percentage rate as we did sequentially in Q2, which is roughly 6%, which I think is more or less in line with the revenue consensus. On the EPS side, we're still again looking at probably 10% to 15%, which, if you do the math, will probably be in between 47 and 50. And again, that's going to come down to how effective we are in getting the mobilizations done. And the quicker you get the mobilizations done, the lower your cost will be and the quicker you will also get the wells into a position where you can recognize the revenue and the profit. So, there's a bit of a range and it is down to the fact that we still will have a very heavy burden to lift on the mobilizations. So, that's the kind of range I would give you at this stage. But I would say, overall, what is really driving our business going forward is going to be our ability to drive the topline and I'm very pleased with where we sit in terms of contracts, tender wins and the fact that we can execute these contracts going forward.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Thanks for the [indiscernible] color. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning, Paal. Appreciate that summary on the operational outlook. Maybe I can ask a question here relating to cash use, cash flow expectations, especially as you get these projects up and running internationally and maybe even kind of give us a rough glimpse on how you expect free cash flow maybe through the back half and maybe give a rough sense as to what cash flow could look like as we go into next year.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. I'll make a couple of quick comments and I'll hand it to Simon to elaborate a bit. But I would say, first of all, we are not satisfied with the free cash flow in the second quarter and even the first half overall. The main issue around the cash flow is the consumption of working capital. And while we have a pretty good handle on inventory and payables, the main issue here is still high DSO and customers paying slowly. I'm not worried about being paid ultimately, but the rate of payment is too slow. And this is something we're already addressing in our commercial discussions with our customers. We had a very good handle on the internal part of the DSO, but we know need to get a bit more traction on the customer side. So, typically, our cash flow – free cash flow improves considerably in the second half of the year, which we do expect it to do this year as well. So, we're overall going to be on track for the year as we plan, but the start in the first half has been slow versus our expectations. Simon, you want to elaborate?
Simon Ayat: Not much to add here. But as Paal mentioned, we're not happy with the first half. It is similar to what we did last year, but we should have done better. The working capital consumption was a bit higher than what we expected. But the second half of the year we always improve and we expect the improvement to come and meet our target for the year. You ask on next year, well, we haven't done any detailed work yet, but given the fact that it is going to be a better year with our growth and we are – we will maintain our investment at a level which is – that meets this growth. So, we expect to do better. The other element of the cash consumption is, obviously, buyback. As you see, we will continue for this year at the modest level. So, in order to preserve the cash to meet the business needs.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. Appreciate that. Maybe I can follow-up as well. Paal, you reference you're still – or have a target of over 60% incremental margins. Obviously, as the cycle kind of kicks in, you get pricing. Sounds like you talk about a broad-based recovery, you talk about accelerating activity levels, you talk about improving pricing on the international front and then double-digit kind of revenue growth internationally next year.  I don't know. Is it safe enough for us to assume that, with all that as the backdrop, that you could potentially 60% incremental margins in 2019? I'm not trying to hold you to that or pin you down. I'm just trying to kind of gauge based on your commentary and what you've said your targets were in the past.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we're ready to ultimately be held to the 65% incremental. That's for sure. Whether we will see the full effect of it next year, I think it's going to come down to how much pricing we will get. What I'm very confident about is our ability is to drive the internal efficiency from all aspect of our operations, right? And what we have done this quarter with the full implementation of our, I would say, fully modernized operating organization is going to be a key driver to make that happen. So, there is a lot of excitement in our field operations around now having his organization in place, with cutting-edge tools and the ability – they know how to drive overall efficiency from the vast international operating base that we have. So, this is going to be a key component of ensuring that we deliver on the 65%. So, whether we get all the way there next year, I think it's going to come down, I think, more of how much pricing we get because I'm very confident about our own ability to execute efficiently.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we to go to the line of Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
James Wicklund: Good morning, guys. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Jim.
James Wicklund: And I'm glad we get to talk about international and we can now talk about international pricing. So, that's all indicative of things definitely improving. Paal, I realize that we haven't planned for 2019, 2020 and beyond. But I look back at your margins and reservoir characterization and in drilling, which are your most international segments. And in 2015, you had margins of 26% in reservoir characterization and 18% in drilling and we're well below that now. I'm not asking when those margins recover, but is there anything fundamentally different in the market going forward that would stop you from getting back to those historical margins at some point in the next couple of years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Jim, no. I don't think there is. Obviously, we have conceded on price a fair bit over the past four years. 
James Wicklund: Yeah. That's near term, though. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Absolutely. 
James Wicklund: It takes a long time to recover.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. So, no – and I'm confident that we can recover at least a fair bit of that. And I think that alone, I think, should be enough for us to get back to those kind of margins. This quarter, reservoir characterization made a pretty big step forward already. And the main issue around the drilling margin is not, I would say, the overall execution capabilities and the technology portfolio, which is highly differentiated. It is the fact that we are carrying a lot of mobilization and startup costs and, with that, inefficiencies. So, I would expect you to see fairly noticeable margin progression over the coming quarters in drilling. So, for us to within next few years get back to those margins that you were indicating for characterization and drilling, I see as absolutely achievable.
James Wicklund: Excellent. Excellent. That's very helpful. My follow-up, if I could, we talked a little bit about Cameron. I know the book-to-bill is at 1. The backlog declined a little bit. There's been a lot of talk about FIDs picking up this year, but from an exceptionally small base. A lot of the FIDs that have been issued are getting slow-rolled by their clients. Can you talk a little bit – you have so much exposure and margin exposure to deepwater – and deepwater, the offshore drillers have, obviously, ran and their stock price is up this year. Is there any increased visibility on when deepwater may start to pick up and when Cameron may move that book-to-bill from 1, which is just fine, to a higher number? Do we have any visibility on deepwater at this point?
Paal Kibsgaard: Patrick, do you want to comment?
Patrick Schorn: Sure. So, Jim, I think that, at this moment, and what we have continuously said is that once the recovery starts, we obviously start seeing it on land and we clearly are now having very clear evidence of what is happening in the shallow offshore. Equally, we are preparing ourselves further for deepwater to start again as well. Whatever size of a bonanza this is going to be, I think, at this moment, it's somewhat unclear.  But from the work that we have been doing in completing our technology portfolio, making sure that we have a leading technology on the boosting side and, clearly, the work that we already signaled that we're doing with Subsea 7 to get a JV that prepares us even more to be ready to play significantly in this market, we do see that we are going to go back in the years to come into deepwater activity because looking at the longer-term supply/demand, there is a certain amount of assets that will have to be developed. So, we're still positive on this market. I think, at this moment, it is a little bit tough to call a deepwater revival short term, but we are preparing ourselves further and, certainly, expect over the longer-term the book-to-bill to go in more favorable numbers.
James Wicklund: Okay, gentlemen. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. 
David Anderson: Hi, good morning. So, as you're ramping on the LSTK contracts and you talked about the 90 rigs you're mobilizing this year, I was just wondering kind of what this looks like going forward. You, obviously, have quite a bit of appetite for this stuff to work. Could you see another 90 rigs, let's say, mobilized next year. I'm just trying to get a sense as to, ultimately, kind of the breadth of this opportunity that you're seeing coming in front of you here.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, at this stage, we don't have visibility into 2019 for that, but I think it's fair to say that we're not expecting to see a similar type of ramp up of that number of rigs in 2019. We expect to be very competitive in every bid that is out there for lump-sum turkey anywhere in the world at this stage. And we feel very confident in our ability to compete and win these tenders and also turn the tenders at competitive rates into good profits for Schlumberger. But I don't anticipate the same level of ramp up in 2019 as in 2018.
David Anderson: Is this still largely concentrated in Saudi and I think we see a little bit of Oman. Can you just talk about maybe some other – I don't know if you want to get too specific here, but are you starting to see it's more broad-based in the Middle East or it's still sort of concentrated in Saudi?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, it is not concentrated in Saudi. Saudi is a very important market for us. And we have a big ramp up of rigs in Saudi over the year. But we have, in addition to that, countries like Mexico, Iraq, India, just to name a few and there are other countries in the Middle East and Gulf area as well where we are starting to take on these double contracts. So, this is much more broader based than one particular country.
David Anderson: Thank you. On a similar subject, Patrick, you had talked about the Palliser block and where you are with the four rigs. I was wondering if you could give us a little toast, kind of where you are in terms of the progression on the wells and the success of that project. We haven't heard too much about that. And during the quarter, there was some talk about monetization. I was just wondering what that means. Does that mean you could potentially be kind of maybe selling out some of your working interest to taking on partners? Just if you could give a little bit more color on that, that will be great. Thank you.
Patrick Schorn: Okay, Dave. So, at this moment, we have about 15 active SBM projects. Palliser, the one in Canada, we did talk about that. We are at the moment active again with four rigs. We'll do well over 100 wells on that asset during this year. As you noticed, it is one way we are shifting from a gas-producing asset to an oil production. The wells are performing very well. We're pleased with the reservoir performance that we see, with the well locations that we have. So, this is going as per plan. Quite keen on that. Ecuador remains active for us with the three assets that we operate there. In Argentina, we're picking up further on the Bandurria Sur asset. And, again, there, we're having very good success with the technology that we deploy in the reservoir. And then, maybe the last one to highlight would be Nigeria where we have a project with First E&P and NNPC. And that is on track to FID here very, very soon. So, just to give you a bit of a broader view on it, the opportunities for new projects really remain plentiful, but we are only considering those at the moment that really fit with what we call the SBM-light business model, where capital intensity and cash flow are much more key criteria in defining which project ultimately fits with us and which doesn't, which is much in line with the communications that we have had previously. So, in the SBM-light context, we've also spoken about monetization of the SBM investments. And there are several assets in our portfolio that are reaching a level of maturity where we have generated the value that we are going to be able to sell. And maybe we'd have to think really about farming up or selling certain portions of our equity in these fields. And this is what we want to do in the next 12 to 18 months once we really start reaching peak valuation on them. On the last point, maybe around SBM, what was highlighted during this quarter was that we exited the OneLNG venture which might've come a bit as a surprise. It's still a business that we believe very much in, which is a business around stranded gas and FLNG technology. But, for us, it has been a decision that we exited purely based on the intensity of capital required for this project. And when we entered, we were very clear on – we are very keen on investing in the upstream, not so much in investing in the vessels itself as that's really not where our money is best employed.  And maybe with that, I've given you a bit of an idea where we are with the main activities around SBM.
David Anderson: Great. Thanks, Patrick. A - Patrick Schorn Thank you, Dave.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Thanks. Good morning. Paal and Simon, so assuming a double-digit increase in international revenues for 2019, how should we think about capital spending consolidated as a percentage of revenues in 2019? Should it look much like it has in 2018 or should the capital intensity go lower given the mobilization unfolding for this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: So, obviously, we haven't gone through the detailed planning for next year. So, it's early to kind of make firm statements about this. But I think, directionally, I think you can expect that the CapEx as a percentage of our revenue going into this upcycle versus previous upcycles is going to be considerably lower. What the absolute number for 2019 CapEx would be? Like I said, it's too early. But I think the planning number I would have on my piece of paper today would still be around the $2 billion mark. And I think, with that, coupled with the big upside we are now starting to see from the complete modernization we have done of our operating platform is going to drive significant asset utilization efficiency. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that drilling and measurement, for instance, in 2018 alone will double their asset utilization of our sold-out PowerDrive technology. So, you can expect us to be, for the base business as well, a lot more capital efficient in this upturn compared to what we have been in previous upturns. And we haven't been too bad in the previous upturns either.
Bill Herbert: Okay, great. Thanks. And you mentioned that pricing was stable in the second quarter for Lower 48 and I presume that meant frac and OneStim. I'm just curious, given the occlusions that are unfolding in the Permian and the slowdown in drilling activity that we've seen in the past eight weeks and what likely will be a slowdown in completions activity, can you comment on the cadence of OneStim deployment going forward? And then, moreover, just your expectations in general for pricing. It seems like it's softening on the margin for the industry.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, in terms of the cadence of the OneStim capacity deployments, I don't want to go into the details of it. Other than that, we basically said that over the course of this year, we would rebuild the equipment and be in a position to reintroduce it into the market. We are continuing to progress well with that plan. There will be always some variations in the deployment rate by month or by quarter. But, at this stage, we are not altering the plan based on some of these takeaway constraint discussions that are on the Permian. We have yet to see that in the projected activity growth. But, again, this is something we will monitor very closely. And in the event, there is a need to adjust, we will adjust. But as of now, we are continuing to deploy. And this is why we are outgrowing both the rig count and the stage count in the market with these deployments. And as to pricing, flat pricing for the OneStim business roughly in the second quarter and we have not seen any kind of major movements beyond that so far into the third quarter either. So, looks pretty stable as per now and we continue with our plan. And as with anything in the North America land market, you've got to be on your toes because it can change quickly.
Bill Herbert: Okay, thank you. Next, we go to the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jud Bailey: Thanks. Good morning. A question, Paal, if I could. You referenced the expectation of double-digit international revenue growth next year. I'd be curious – number one, how do you think about visibility for choosing that kind of growth next year? And then, number two, how do you think about the drivers of that growth? I guess, for me, their regional standpoint and also how you'd see the potential split between offshore and onshore growth playing out next year as well?
Paal Kibsgaard: Again, I gave the double-digit international growth numbers basically because we are confident on the backlog we have of contract wins. And we know where these wins are and how it's going to shape up. Now, we have not done the detailed planning. So, I can't give you any kind of granular review of where it's going to come. But, in general, we see growth in all geographies next year. I would say, land is still likely to be the driving force of it. Obviously, a lot of our lump-sum turnkey sits on land. And this is where the shorter cycle barrels are. But I think we will start to see movement in particular on shallow water as well. I believe there are some movements in shallow water rig rates, which I think is a very good precursor to what is likely to happen. And going back to deepwater, deepwater drilling activity in 2018 is roughly going to be 10% up versus 2017. And I think the growth in deepwater would probably continue and potentially accelerate as well into 2019. So, I know I'm not giving you the details you're looking for mainly because we haven't done the detailed planning as of yet, but I see no region of the world which we see as a region that is not going to grow in 2019. And we find that to be very good news.
Jud Bailey: Okay. I appreciate the comments. And I'd say, my follow-up would be, most of the commentary so far industrywide has been on the expectation that development work will kind of dominate the next leg of deepwater activity. Are you seeing any hints of improvement in terms of exploration on the deepwater side? Or is it still dominated from [indiscernible] side?
Paal Kibsgaard: It's a good question. Obviously, in terms of the absolute volume. it is dominated by development. But we are starting to see that exploration spend appears to be turning a corner as well. I mean, the current level of exploration investment over the past, whatever, three, four years is, obviously, clearly, not sustainable. And we are starting to see some uptick there. Q2, in terms of exploration rig count, was actually up 22% sequentially and about 7% year-over-year. And we expect that, in 2018, exploration, drilling and well services spend is probably going to be around 12% higher than 2017. So, both deepwater and exploration is starting to show kind of double-digit growth already in 2018. And I can only see that accelerating going into 2019. And associated with exploration, we are actually also starting to see more interest and more discussion with our customers again on formation evaluation. This being either wireline or LWD and actually customers going back into – talking more reservoir with us. And, obviously, this is very good news for some of our high-end measurement related businesses as well. So, exploration is coming. And it's also associated with increased focus on reservoir information evaluation.
Jud Bailey: Great, thank you. I'll turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question is from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Waqar Syed: Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Paal, the pricing improvement that you expect later in the year, would that start to have a benefit in first half of 2019 or do you see that, by the time it turns into contracts and revenues, it could be late 2019 or even 2020?
Paal Kibsgaard: No. I think the pricing discussions we are starting to have now – and we had some pricing improvements already happening in the second quarter, they're not big enough to be material, so you can see them in our results. But we tracked it very carefully and we have specific plans by customer and by contracts and by market on how we're going to engage into recover some of the big concessions that we have made. So, the pricing improvements we are now discussing and seeking should have a gradual impact on our results going forward, right? So, I would say the discussions we are having in the second half of this year should have an impact on our results in the first half of 2019. To what effect? It's still early to say. But with activity continuing to go up, with ourselves at least being fully deployed capacity-wise by the end of the year, I think it's only natural that pricing comes up and starts to have a – be a bit of a tailwind on our results and it's been a pretty significant headwind for, what, four years in a row now. So, I'm encouraged in terms of what I'm seeing around the pricing discussions and also optimistic that this will become more of a noticeable tailwind as we go into 2019.
Waqar Syed: And then, just finally on that – as you go into 2019 and you're expecting a revenue growth internationally in double digits, could you do that with the same kind of capital budgets, around $2 billion, or do you think the CapEx will need to grow as we go into next year?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, we can do that with that same CapEx budget of $2 billion. That's on the back of the modernized field operating platform.
Waqar Syed: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Waqar.
Paal Kibsgaard: So, before we close today's call, let me summarize the main messages. Oilfield activity strengthened in the second quarter, both in land in North America and also throughout the international markets. And as a result, we delivered strong sequential revenue growth.  With a total of 90 rigs being mobilized over the course of 2018, the integrated drilling services model is one of our many growth drivers in the global upcycle we are now entering. The second quarter saw us complete an important milestone in our transformation program as we rolled out our modernized field and support organization. And linked to this, we also completed the second and last step to simplify our management structure, which altogether puts us in a great position to outperform in the emerging global upturn, both in terms of topline revenue and bottom-line earnings growth. With that, we conclude today's call. Thank you for participating.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's call is being hosted from Moscow, Russia, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, New Ventures. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which, we will open up for questions. For today's agenda, Simon will first present comments on our first quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro. However, before we begin, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. Now, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.38. This represents a decrease of $0.10 sequentially and an increase of $0.13 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our first quarter revenue of $7.8 billion decreased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonal declines. Pretax operating margin decreased by 169 basis points to 12%. Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 5% sequentially, primarily due to a seasonal decline in Wireline activities and lower SIS software and multi-client license sales following the usual, but muted impact of year end. Margins decreased 224 basis points to 19.7%, driven by the lower contribution from Wireline and SIS software sales. Drilling group revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 2% sequentially, while margins decreased 85 basis points to 13.8%. The strong activity in North America was more than offset by seasonal lower drilling activity in the international areas. Production group revenue of $3 billion decreased 4% sequentially and margins fell by 291 basis points to 7.3%. These results were primarily driven by lower activity in the international markets and transient headwinds that impacted the North America hydraulic fracturing market. Cameron group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 7% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by OneSubsea as a result of declining project volumes. Each of Cameron's other product lines also contributed to the decline. Margin decreased 169 basis points to 12.7%, reflecting the lower revenue during the quarter. The book to bill ratio for the Cameron long cycle basis was 0.8. However, the book to bill ratio for the entire group is now at 1, reflecting an increasing backlog of the short cycle businesses. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was approximately 18% in the first quarter compared to 19% in the previous quarter. Looking forward, the ETR will be sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. With the continued recovery in North America, we anticipate that the ETR will increase next quarter and over the course of the year. We generated $568 million of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payment associated with employee compensation. Our net debt increased $800 million during the quarter to $13.9 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we spent $97 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares at an average price of $69.79. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $450 million and capitalized costs relating to SPM project of $240 million. During the quarter, we also made $692 million of dividend payments. Full year 2018 CapEx excluding SPM and multi-client investments is still expected to be approximately $2 billion. Now, I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.
Patrick Schorn: Thank you, Simon and good morning everyone. Revenue in the first quarter of 2018 dropped 4% sequentially with pretax operating income decreasing by 16%. In North America, drilling and project activity continued to grow, but our results were negatively impacted by lower than expected pressure pumping activity, together with pricing pressure and supply chain inefficiencies. In the international markets, the underlying business performed as expected for all product lines, including the expected transitory headwinds from the seasonal winter slowdown in the Northern hemisphere and the planned project startup costs associated with recent contract wins. Looking closer at our North America results, revenue increased 1% sequentially with improved land revenue in the US and Canada and stronger offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, more than offsetting the seasonal drop in Western Geco multi-client sales from the US Gulf of Mexico. Cameron group revenue was lower, following the year end product sales of surface systems and valves and measurement. Onshore in North America, we experienced a slow start to the quarter due to freezing weather and as many shale oil operators took a conservative approach to ramping up activity after the holidays. However with oil prices stabilizing well above $60, both drilling and pressure pumping activity started to ramp up in the second half of the quarter and showed healthy first quarter exit rates. In this market environment, our North America land revenue, excluding Cameron grew 4% year-over-year, matching the increase in rig counts. Growth was driven by higher drilling and project activity with the ramp up of winter drilling activity in Western Canada and continued high demand for rotary steerable systems to drill longer laterals with our two fleet utilization increasing 24% sequentially. In OneStim, we continued to add fleets, but less than planned due to market over capacity that led to lower utilization, inefficiencies, and softer pricing. These headwinds were compounded by inefficiencies and increased costs associated with rail, logistical issues impacting the supply of our sand in parts of our operations. Despite these disruptions on transformation of our logistics control and the vertical integration of our own sand supply successfully ensured strong service quality and overall business continuity for longer operations, which was recognized by our customer base. During the first quarter, we continued to actively deploy our spare fracturing equipment including the first spreads from our newly acquired fleet and the operational performance of these new crudes has already reached the standard of our existing pressure pumping business. Let's now turn to the international areas. Starting with Latin America, revenue decreased 16% sequentially. This was due to lower hydraulic fracturing stage count in Argentina, reduced activity in Brazil as we mobilized for new offshore projects for several international operators and that our cash-based operations in Venezuela declined further. On the positive side, revenue in Mexico grew as onshore workover activity increased and as we continued to monetize our newly acquired Western GECO multi-client seismic library on the back of another successful background for new offshore acreage in Mexico during the quarter. Seasonally lower Cameron group revenue also contributed to the decrease. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue decreased 6% sequentially, primarily due to seasonal activity declines in Russia and the Caspian Sea region that impacted all product lines. Activity was seasonally lower as well in the UK and continental Europe GeoMarkets where operations were hit by weather delays and changes in customer drilling plans. In addition, SIS software license and Western GECO multi-client license sales were generally weaker sequentially, despite positive multi-client seismic sales in the Scandinavia GeoMarket related to license sales on the Norwegian continental shelf. Revenue from our Africa GeoMarkets were in line with our expectations as solid performance from new onshore projects in Libya and Chad offset further delays for several integrated projects in Gabon, Nigeria and Ghana. Cameron group revenue during the quarter was higher, particularly in the Russia and Central Asia GeoMarket. Turning next to the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 4% sequentially, driven by pricing pressure and lower grilling and hydraulic fracturing activity on land in the Middle East, which was partially offset by stronger drilling activity in Iraq, improved testing services revenue in Qatar and Egypt and solid progress on our long term surface facility project in the region. The move towards more performance based work in the Middle East was further reinforced during the first quarter as we won another IDS contract in Saudi Arabia for 70 long-term turnkey wells which comes in addition to the 274 wells awarded previously, for which we mobilized the first two rigs at the end of the first quarter. In Asia, fourth quarter revenue came in above our expectations, driven by accelerated sale of processing equipment in Thailand and project startups in India, competition encroachment in Australia and increased activity on land in China. Cameron Group was slightly lower with growth in Asia offset by seasonally lower revenue in the Middle East. And with that, let me pass the call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you and good morning, everyone. As described by Simon and Patrick, our first quarter activity was generally in line with expectations, with solid year-over-year growth in Europe, Russia and the Middle East, positive recovery signs in Asia, continued subdued activity in Africa and Latin America, while transient market weakness impacted our business in North America land. During the quarter, we observed mobilization and reactivation costs associated with new projects startups and we also started to reposition our spare capacity in the international market, as we look to maximize our ability to capture profitable growth in the coming quarters and into 2019. So with one quarter of the emerging upturn behind us, let me give you our latest views on how the global oil market, E&P investments and oil selectivity will unfold over the coming year. Looking first at the global oil market, the absence of the normal seasonal stock builds in the first quarter clearly demonstrates that supply and demand is now in balance, which combined with increased geopolitical risk is what has driven oil prices up by more than 10% over the past month. Global crude stocks and days forward coverage is already well below the five year average and bigger growth are expected from the current stock levels in the coming quarters. These anticipated stock growths are underpinned by a continued strong outlook for oil demand with global growth continuing to be projected between 1.5 million and 1.8 million barrels per day in both 2018 and 2019 and with the current US China trade war tension not expected to escalate into lower global growth at this stage. On the supply side, after three consecutive years of dramatic underinvestment in global E&P activity, the worldwide production base has [Technical Difficulty] the expected signs of weakening with noticeable year-over-year production declines appearing in several countries such as Angola, Norway, Mexico, Malaysia, China and Indonesia. This trend is expected to spread and accelerate and impact as the level of new [Technical Difficulty] from prior investments continues to fade into 2019. With Libya and Nigeria producing at near-full capacity, Venezuelan production in free fall, and the potential of new sanctions against Iran, the only major sources of short-term supply growth to address the global production decline and strong worldwide demand growth are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Russia, and the US shale land shale oil operators. At present, the collective spare capacity of the three core OPEC countries is only in the range of 3 million barrels per day. There are also emerging questions around whether the very bullish production growth outlook for US share oil can be fully met, as the industry is coming to face challenges linked to well to well interference as more infill training takes place. Lower production per well as drilling increasingly steps out from tier 1 acreage as operators look to overcome growing infrastructure constraints and as refineries approach current processing capacity for light oil. In spite of these clear signs of a tightening oil market, there has been no upwards revision to 2018 E&P spending with North American and International upstream investments still expected to grow in the range of 20% and 5% respectively. Based on these investment levels and the current supplies, we believe it is increasingly likely that the industry will face growing supply challenges over the coming years and that a significant increase in global E&P investment will be required to minimize the impending production deficit. The key indicator for this evolving trend continues to be global oil inventory level and not US inventories alone, as significant weekly swings in import and export levels often marks the actual evolution of the underlying US supply and demand. Turning next to the oilfield services market, we expect drilling activity in North America land to continue to grow in volume and complexity in the coming quarters as more of our customers move towards longer horizontal lateral. In this market, we continue to be sold out of our differentiated directional and drill bit technologies as we again posted strong growth in the first quarter and we still command a solid pricing premium for our services. In addition to our downhole drilling technology, we are now ready to introduce into the US land market the first complete version of our Rig of the Future as well as our new DELFI enabled drilling software platform that covers the complete drilling process all the way from well design and planning to wellhead execution and total system optimization. We are fully focused on the successful introduction of our new and unique well construction offering into the land market as we aim to provide a step change in drilling performance to our customers. Next, we also see continued growth throughout 2018 in our North America land pressure pumping business, driven by strong underlying activity as well as market share gains, as we deployed a further 1 million horsepower over the course of 2018. With the activity and pricing softness seen in the first quarter as a number of companies added significant new capacity, we expect the market to remain close to being balanced in the coming quarters from an equipment capacity standpoint. This means that frac pricing will likely be range bound and driven by short-term or local supply demand variations and that any upwards pricing movements will likely be limited to passing on people and supply chain cost inflation. In this environment, we have four differentiating factors that will ensure that our frac business meets our financial return expectations, the superior service quality we deliver to our customers, the technology driven efficiency improvement we create at the individual fleet level, the scale advantage we have as to deploy our new capacity and the increasing benefits we are generating from our vertical integration investment program. In the international markets, tendering activity remained high and continues to be very competitive and with a clear move towards performance based contracts for many of our customers. We clearly welcome this trend as it offers [Technical Difficulty] and provides us with a clear financial upside, as we leverage our technology systems, people expertise [Technical Difficulty] capabilities to set new performance benchmarks. In terms of pricing for basic standalone products and services we are yet to see an inflection point and there is still sufficient capacity in the market. However, as the early signs of improving rig rate for land rates, [indiscernible] continues to evolve over the coming quarters, the value proposition of our high end products and services become increasingly attractive compared to the basic performance offered by our competitors and this is where we first expect to see pricing traction in the international market. In terms of geographical trends, our outlook for Russia, the Middle East and the North Sea remains solid and in line with our expectations for the year. While the emerging upside we are seeing in Asia will likely be offset by a somewhat slower growth trajectory in Africa and Latin America, where the start of the activity recovery now seems to be pushed out to the second half of 2018. So overall, the international markets are evolving in line with our expectations for the year and we are excited about the outlook for Schlumberger. We are ready and primed to deliver superior growth, financial returns and free cash flow in the coming years by building on the broader technology offering and expertise in the industry, our unmatched scale and operational efficiency, strong capital discipline and a clear desire to provide industry leading cash returns to our shareholders. Before we open up for questions, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the more than 100,000 women and men that make up the Schlumberger workforce. You are the best team in the industry and I want to thank you for your unwavering commitment to your jobs, to our customers and to the company over the past few years where we together have navigated through very tough market conditions. Now, things are again looking brighter for the industry and for Schlumberger and I look forward to facing the new and more energizing challenges of the growth market together with all of you. Thank you. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question here will come from Ken Sill with SunTrust Robinson.
Ken Sill: This is a good quarter and a tough environment here. One of my first questions is on pressure pumping. You're planning to put 1 million horsepower out. How much did you actually deploy in Q1.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I'm not going to go into the details of exactly how much we deployed. We continue to deploy and I would say that we deployed less than what we planned to, mainly because the overall softness that we experienced in the market. I think, the overall stage count growth market wide was a bit lower than expected and in addition to that, a number of other companies added fairly significant capacity to the market and this had an impact on softening pricing and also it impacted utilization. So we introduced somewhat lower, a lower number of fleets in the first quarter and it was more backend loaded, but we are back on our plan rate of introduction as we enter Q2 and our plan is still to deploy the full 1 million horsepower that we acquired during the course of 2018.
Ken Sill: Okay. And then to step to a big picture question, you're very optimistic about the outlook, makes a lot of sense given what we're seeing in inventories. Are you concerned with the Wall Street estimates on timing of the recovery or it seems like international is going to remain slow, North America up 20%. I think some estimate is a little bit higher than that, but it just doesn't seem like people are moving to raise their CapEx budgets very quickly. So I think the trend is very positive, but do you have any concerns about the timing of the growth in activity.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, from an operational planning and execution front, from the Schlumberger side, international is unfolding this year as we were expecting. The rate of increase in investment levels is as you note significantly lower than what we see in North America, which was expected. But even with the 5% or plus or minus 5% increase in investment, we can generate I think quite reasonable earnings growth out of that, mainly because we have a much higher market here internationally. Our margins are generally higher and our ability to generate incremental is also much higher internationally than in North America. So even though there is a 4 to 1 ratio on investment growth levels, the [Technical Difficulty] business and our ability to generate earnings. Based on that, I'm quite positive on what we can make out of this growth rate even in 2018. But if you ask me, if the investment levels in the international market is sufficient, I would say no, it isn't. So from a supply ability, I would be concerned whether the international market and the producers there are going to be able to produce sufficient to meet the growth in demand, but there's little I can do about that, but I would just say that international for us is unfolding as expected and I think there is only upside beyond where we are today going forward.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: Thanks and Paal, good early evening to you. Paal, I guess first off, I wanted to ask about the - you had your board meetings in Russia, in Moscow this week. You obviously are still pursuing a transaction there with Eurasia. Could you maybe give us some color around kind of what you and the board saw this week, what you were doing? I mean similar to other major board meetings that you've had in places like Saudi, you picked Moscow for a reason and I love to hear that that reason and why - what you guys are up to in that market, given that it's a very, very large service market.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. Thanks, James. Yeah. As you know, our board is very much engaged in our business and we dedicate one board meeting a year to go out into our field operations and engage with our employees, with selected customers and also industry experts in the various regions around the world. As you know, in Saudi Arabia, last year had a great visit there and if you look at the largest parts of our business, it is basically in between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. So the reason for picking Russia this year is that it is a huge part of our business. It is a business that has shown very good growth and strength over the past three or four years. And it was something that the board wanted to see up close a little bit more. So this week, in addition to the normal board proceeding, the board had the opportunity to interact with a number of selected customers and partners, we engaged with some of the Russian oil industry experts and also the board had the opportunity to lead some of our 11,000 Russian employees. It's been a very productive week. We have provided the board with a broad industry and business update for Russia and we've also detailed our further investment plans in the country. And as to the EDC transaction, Simon, do you want to comment briefly on where we stand on that?
Simon Ayat: Yeah. Let me give a quick update. Basically since announcing the deal was the EDC shareholders, we've been discussing with the respective authorities, all aspects of the transaction, including the size of our participation and the structure of the entity acquired in this state. As a result, we are very happy to say that we were able to satisfy and address all the concerns raised by the different respective authorities. What is more important that our objective of the deal remain unchanged, which is to deliver the best and most efficient operation to our clients through integration and deployment of technology. Schlumberger would remain the driver behind the operations of EDC as and when the transaction closes.
Paal Kibsgaard: So James, as to if and when it closes, there is nothing much more we can say than this, other than we do have very good engagement with Eurasian authority. The file is now with them. We need to give them time for them to do their job and we are at their disposal if there is any further follow-up that is required.
James West: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Paal. Thanks, Simon. And then a follow-up for me, Paal, on the international side. You announced a number of major key contract awards last quarter and this quarter, but it seems to me there is a lot of stuff going on in the background that has yet to be announced as well as this international recovery really takes hold and gains momentum and understanding that spending activity this year is going to lag I guess the North American spending increase, it seems to me like heading into 19, we're looking at a pretty big inflection point for international. Is that a fair comment?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. I think that's a fair comment. There is, as you note, significant tendering activity presently. What we are excited about is that a fair bit of these tenders are now shifting towards performance based contracts, which means that even if they're quite competitive the bid, we have a fairly significant financial upside by being able to execute in certain of these performance standards on these activities. So, I would say activity, we expect to continue to ramp during the year, very solid performance and outlook still in Middle East, Russia, North Sea. Asia is surprising a bit to the upside and we're dragging a little bit further on Africa and Latin America. We expect that to start increasing as well in the second half of the year. So I agree with you. I think the outlook for international is strengthening as we go through this year and should be even stronger in 2019.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angie Sedita: So Paal, a little bit further on the international side, you touched on it in your prepared remarks on pricing and the potential for pricing maybe late 2018, going into 2019. Maybe a little color there and then specifically you highlighted your obvious strengths on the technology side as far as deepwater. So maybe you can go into that a little bit further.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. In terms of pricing, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, no inflection point yet when you look at basic products and services. But again the shift towards performance contracts will allow us to increase our effective pricing by performing well on these projects and I think we're very well set up to do that. And the other point which I wanted to mention as well is that as the emerging signs of the rig rate continue to evolve in positive direction and we've seen some encouraging signs in certain land markets for sure on shallow water jackups and even in selected ultra deepwater environment. So when the rig rate starts to come up, the value proposition or our high end technology and services and the value of service quality and execution is going to quickly become increasingly attractive when compared to the basic performance of our competitors. So I think this is where we expect to see pricing to come first and I think it's reasonable to expect that this will start to take shape in the second half of the year.
Angie Sedita: And then going back to Russia and EDC, what do you think on Eurasia Drilling would bring to Schlumberger. What's the opportunity set by owning that company or a portion of that company and just be opportunistic overall in Russia as we go into 2019?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, the opportunity set that are on Eurasia Drilling for us has always been the fact that it will allow us firstly to bring our latest total drilling technology systems to the Russia land market. It is a very drilling intensive market. Today, there is no real integration happening. We have a very strong purpose built downhole offering in Russia, partly through a combination of acquisitions we've made and also organic R&D investment made within the Russia R&D organization. And when we add that to the Rig of the Future where we are working on creating winterized Rig of the Future version for introduction in Russia land as well as the drilling sulfur package, there is huge, I would say, drilling performance upside in Western Siberia by introduction of both software and the rig and this is the whole excitement we have around Eurasia transaction. It is a very well-run company, a company we know very well. We have partnered and worked with them for a number of years, but being present on the ownership side that will allow us to take a stronger position in driving the technology direction and I think that is what creates the excitement.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
Scott Gruber: I have a question on SPM. You're slowing project sanctioning as you discussed last quarter, given the base business outlook is improving here. I'm curious about the free cash conversion of SPM when you're just spending a maintenance CapEx. CapEx, as a percent of sales, I imagine, is still above your base business, just given the nature of the business, how should we think about the free cash conversion out of net income for that business when you're just spending it in maintenance mode. Is it accretive to the conversion targets for the company or is it dilutive?
Paal Kibsgaard: Patrick, do you want to comment on that?
Patrick Schorn: Yeah. Maybe I think it's a little bit more general goal. I mean as you are well aware, I mean during the downturn, we've had a significant growth initiative around SPM. As far as this has been a growth avenue that allowed us to get the best returns on our technology. We also announced as we saw the cycle change that we were putting an end to our very strong countercyclical investment program. So with that becomes a very strong discipline around the new project that we are investing in and obviously also with the CapEx that we invest in the ongoing project. Now, this is always a bit of a balance that you're trying to strike between the IBP that you're generating today and the long term value that you're generating in these type of assets. So what we're going to do going forward is that we maintain a very disciplined investment and that we're also looking at monetizing some of these assets and which obviously is one of the biggest ways to start making a significant dent in the cash flow of these assets. So we are looking today at monetizing some of our assets during the turn of 2018, but we want to make sure that we do this at the right time and the most opportune time is when we are having de-risk some of these projects and that we have sufficient value proven that we can obviously then also sell these on as we go along. So we are fully expecting to engage with interesting parties here over the next quarters and we actually are seeing the interest build in this type of transaction. And that is maybe the best that I can give a bit of color around the question that you're asking.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Patrick, maybe if you could update us on progress on Palliser and the projects in Nigeria and Argentina.
Patrick Schorn: Yes. I certainly can. So we started operation at the end of last year and we concluded a variety of operations, obviously the production operations, we started workover. So as far as drilling new wells, we've had up to four rigs drilling simultaneously up in Canada on the Torxen project. We have added around 56 wells to date. And I think that the key thing to remember is that our investment is fully focused on increasing the oil production from this asset. So we will continue to hook up and put on production these new wells in the months to come and once breakup finishes, we expect to start drilling again in the second half of this year. And quite frankly, we're quite pleased with the progress that the team has made in Canada in a very short time in turning this asset into a very focused organization on oil. When it comes to Nigeria, there, we are going through a lot of fee type work. We're working closely with our partners and here, you would have to think about detailed design around FPSO conversions, the top sites that are needing to be prepared. Everything there is on track. And we're looking to do an FID date here later in the year. So from that, that gives you a bit of an idea of where we are in Nigeria. And the last one, Argentina is doing well. We have drilled a number of wells, the ones that we have at this moment are producing very well, very close to our P10 type of expectation. So, things are looping up when it comes to the performance of the individual wells, but let's be very clear as well I mean, there is no field developed with one or two wells, but we need to make sure that we are drilling many, many very good wells. What we're seeing right now encourages us and that obviously also then helps when you're starting to think about monetization in the future.
Operator: And your next question here will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, Paal. I was wondering if you, I guess I'm just still trying to grab my hands around some of the dynamics that are taking place in the US frac market. And you did a great job in trying to walk us through some of these things. I'm just not quite sure if I got a handle on it. So apologize if I'm asking the question that you may have already answered, I'm a little slow on the update. So you mentioned during the first quarter, you've had some challenges around the industry, bringing in some new capacity that led to some softer pricing. Then I heard Patrick talk about things kind of picking up as you go into the end of the first quarter. And then some positive dynamics for the second quarter, yet couched around the prospect for incremental capacity to still kind of creep into the system. So where do we stand? I mean is demand still exceeding available supply in the frac business or are we now at a point where we're kind of going to be stuck in neutral and companies are going to continue to put capacity into the market and print the pricing power as we get into the last three quarters of the year. So, just again if you can give a little more color around that, that would be helpful.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. So what we said is, from a supply and demand standpoint of frac equipment in Q1, I think it's pretty clear that we had overcapacity as an industry based on the available stages during the first quarter. So we are more or less our capacity today. I think the market going forward when it comes to frac equipment I think is going to also label around being in balance. I think you will probably have local valuations in certain basins. You might have a temporary oversupply, undersupply based on where companies introduce new capacity. But I think the fact that we are now more or less at capacity and we need to accept that it will be in that situation for the duration of this year, I think is pretty clear. And given the fact that the market has been growing steadily now for the second year in a row and also given the fact that we have a very agile service industry and manufacturing industry to support the service industry, it's not a huge surprise that in a fully commoditized market, that supply is going to match demand at some stage and I think we're basically there. So I think from a pricing standpoint, we don't expect any significant tailwinds of kind of net effective pricing. We do expect to continue to be able to pass on additional costs associated with people and supply chain inflation. But beyond that, I think operating margins and profitability is going to have to be driven by how you execute. And from our standpoint, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are four major drivers. One is the service quality and the business continuity that we are able to provide to our customers in any kind of market situation. We also have significant investments into technology that drives individual fleet operating efficiency. As we add another 1 million horse power over the course of 2018, that's going to give us a fairly significant scale advantage and then also what we see is increasing benefits from our vertical integration program, right? So, I think it's going to be a challenging market situation throughout 2018, but we have some levers that we are very much focused on, which makes me confident that we're going to be able to meet our return, I would say, expectations for the investments that we make into this.
Operator: The question here will come from the line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse.
James Wicklund: International, I want to drill down a little bit if I could Paal on the performance based contracts. You guys have been pushing this for some time and I know everybody's been a little disappointed at the uptake. But you in your first lumpsum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia and more to come, do you finish your first well on a performance based contract with board drilling in Gabon. The market is concerned that lumpsum turnkey contracts get too competitive, you kind of addressed that, saying that, even though there are big competitive, you have the opportunity to outperform. Can you talk a little bit more about how you do that and is this just a matter of throwing your best technology that the companies, your client themselves might not hire on a regular service basis. Can you talk about how, especially with those two contracts and I realize they're different, how this is going to north of the next couple of years into a much wider performance based type business internationally?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. That's a good question, Jim. So the way we see this contract as you rightfully point out that they are competitively bid as with anything, but with the investments we are making from an R&D standpoint in particular in to our drilling portfolio and with the ultimate focus of creating one drill as a complete revolutionary total billing system, that's where our ability to execute and drive performance on any type of contract to a completely new level that even though we've been - we win the contract at a very competitive pricing, we can over the course of that contract generate very healthy returns to the company. So the way we do this is like I said by having firstly superior individual technology building blocks. Then it's the ability to bring this together to a complete operating and planning software package with drill plan and drill ups is going to do and this is all sitting on our DELFI digital system, which allows every application to share all the data on the information. And then on top of this, it is the domain expertise that we have from the drilling and subsurface as well as our operational execution on the wells that I described. So I can't really point to one thing, but the key with any kind of lumpsum turnkey contract is that you improve the drilling performance over the course of the contract and generally well number ten is drilled significantly faster than wells number one. The key with our system and the whole digital approach is that we ideally - we don't want to start off with the performance of the traditional well number one. We want to start off with well number one matching the traditional performance of well number 10. And if you can do that, you can move up the profitability and the gains you're making and drilling experience from the digital environment that you have deployed on all your operations around the world and this is a major differentiator going forward as to how we can start generating very good returns even in the first wells of the program rather than well 10 or 15 as you get into the second or third year of operation. But this is how we want to set ourselves apart. This is how we are setting ourselves apart and obviously the rigs is going to play an increasingly important part of how we drive performance right and that's why we have a very strong position on rigs with the ADC in Saudi Arabia. This is again linked to our interest in EDC in Russia and then beyond that, we are now actively introducing our Rig of the Future into the US land market as well and these three markets are really the main land drilling markets around the world. And lastly, I would say that this is also why we have made an investment to board drilling. We see performance based contract similar to what I described on land here also to now move in to shallow water and we are very happy and very excited about the partnership and investment we made in board drilling and we see significant opportunities on shallow water together with bore and potential other shallow water drillers to also introduce performance based contracts to this environment.
James Wicklund: My follow up if I could, a couple of years ago we were talking about a great deal about the transformational effort that Schlumberger was going through and on the staged basis and I know the downturn kind of interrupted some of the plans. Can you tell us is the transformational effort that was started a couple of years ago, is that done yet, are we getting closer or what phase are we in at this point.
Paal Kibsgaard: That's a very good question, James. I would say that the downturn in the past three years had an impact on the, what they're trying to mention has grown to our bottom line and it's mainly because it is very difficult to monetize efficiency in an environment where your business continues to shrink quarter after quarter. What we have done during this period of time is that we have ring-fenced the investment in the transformation program and we have continued to evolve it, we have continued to deploy it. We are in the middle of significant deployment as we seek around how we change our workflows, how we introduce new backlog of systems and how we basically conduct all our internal business processes. So this is all progressing and I would say that going forward, the transformation is going to be a critical factor in our ability to generate the incremental margins that we have promised. And I think as soon as you see us now starting to generate a little bit of growth in the international market and we are finished with the pricing concession, that's when I think the impact of the transformation is going to start to become very visible again. We are maintaining, for instance, our CapEx, the investment levels around $2 billion this year, which is as low as it's been throughout the entire downturn and we're doing this because a significant part of the increased activity we are actually going to absorb through increased asset utilization, but this is one way that we are demonstrating what a confirmation can bring. So I would still say that we are in the mid-innings of what the impact of the transformation can bring, but we have continued to advance forward the investments and the deployment of this so that we are very optimistic of what it is going to bring us here as we go forward into 2018 and 2019.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of David Anderson with Barclays.
David Anderson: I just wanted to stick on the LSTK subject here. So Paal, with more of the tendering activity kind of moving towards lumpsum turnkey contracts, I was just wondering if you could just help us conceptually understand how you view the difference between SPM and LSTK, just in terms of say the upside versus the execution risk in both types of contracts. It feels like this is more execution with an LSTK. I was just wondering if you could kind of talk about that of how you look at the two types and whether or not you have a preference for either one of those type of contracts.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So if you think there's more execution risk on LSTK, I can debunk that pretty firmly. That is obviously not the case. The highest risk profile of any contract type that we take on is on SPM. On LSTK, there is - the performance risk you basically take on there is that you stipulate a fixed price for a well profile that you have seen and as you can study upfront before you submit your bid, we analyze there is - in great detail the global database and experienced base to understand how we can drill these wells and how we can beat the curve basically. And the risk you take on is basically the time it takes to drill the well, because most of the drilling costs are time based. So the risk profile of LSTK is a small fraction of what the risk profile of a SPM project is. And also from a cash standpoint, LSTK is fairly close in terms of payment terms to the base business. It's about - generally you get paid on completing complete wells and this is very close to the payment DSO levels that we're looking at for the base business. So cash exposure, profitability exposure is much more limited than what you see in SPM. And again the ability that I just outlined in the previous question there makes us extremely comfortable with taking on these type of contracts and I would say that generally for all the contracts that we take on, we typically beat the curve and our objective going forward is to continue to beat it by a wider margin.
David Anderson: So is it fair to say that if these contracts are bit fairly competitively that maybe the margins as these contracts start up and I guess in year one are going to, expectations that these are going to improve measurably by year three, is that sort of the idea we should be thinking about that as these come out, maybe a little bit lower profitably today, but the idea is once you start getting these costs and these startup costs all taken care of that the margins all start to uplift, is that sort of how we should be thinking about this.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. Generally, LSTK contracts have improving profitability over the course of the contract and there are some mobilization prospects. They're not really significant unless they are huge contracts, like for instance the once we are currently mobilizing for in Saudi Arabia. But I would say that the profitability isn't necessarily linked to the mobilization. It's more linked to the fact that your drilling, I would say, curve improves as you build more wells and as I was saying in the earlier question, our goal and what our drilling system is going to enable us to is to basically fast forward on that experience curve. So our well number one isn't going to have the traditional performance level of a graphical well number one. We want to start way down the line, which means that profitability should be much higher in the early parts of these projects as we go forward compared to what they were in the past, but still be able to improve over the course of the project.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons.
Bill Herbert: Paal, I'm just curious, so the expectation for an increase in a 5% with regard international E&P capital spending, you should do a little bit better than that based upon market share. And against that backdrop, what do you think are reasonable expectations for international incremental margins off that mid to high single digit revenue growth for this year.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. Bill, I think it's a bit too early to make a straight commitment on this, because there are still some forces playing in opposite directions, right, but there are some startup costs, there are some repositioning costs. We've got to work through some of the pricing concessions that we have been giving - given in recent quarters. So I still think it's too early to give you a straight commitment to what sort of sequential incremental margins are going to be in the coming couple of quarters. We stand behind the 65% as we get into steady state growth in the international market. We're going to require some pricing tailwind to get there, but we stand behind that, but I think it's a bit too early to say what the incrementals are going to be, say, into Q2 and Q3. Other than that, they should steadily improve and we have very clear plans in place, enormously getting pricing traction, leveraging performance based contracts and then starting to fully capitalize on the sustained investments we've made in transformation program. So, I think we have all the ingredients there. It's ready to be, I would say, capitalized on, but I'm not going to give you a number say for Q2 and Q3 as of yet.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And can we speak about the second quarter expectation here, which seems to be a more tangible premise. The Street estimates of $0.48 or thereabouts, high $0.40. You delivered $0.38. Is that a tenable proposition with regard to the realization of that earnings per share?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I think it is. There is a little bit of color on that. If you look at these, we see solid revenue growth in both drilling and pressure pumping. We're going to work through as usual the kind of a breakup in the second quarter. In the international market, we continue to see the trends that we saw in Q1, strong performance in Middle East, Russia, North Sea. Asia is basically joining that list now and it's slight upside in Asia. But then a bit more limited growth in Africa and Latin America, right. So assuming that the softer pricing and utilization in North America land pressure pumping doesn't really carry into Q2 and at this stage, we don't think it will, then I will say that the current EPS consensus is pretty much in line with how he see.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Byron Pope: Thanks. I just have one question. Paal, you framed some of the 2018 growth drivers for Schlumberger in terms of GeoMarkets. I was wondering at a high level, could you do the same in terms of which of the groups you think lead the growth. It seems certainly that protection group will be there, just given the frac fleet reactivations, but could you frame at a high level how you think about the growth drivers from a group perspective this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. It's a bit easier to do it, down to the specifics when you look at geography, right. I would say, overall, I see very good growth potential from all four groups. You mentioned production, yes, absolutely. I think with the investments we made in frac capacity and vertical integration and the way we set up in North American land now, I expect that North America will be a strong driver for production group growth, but as well we have obviously a significant business globally as well, strong fracking activity in the Middle East and Argentina as well as other parts of the business that will contribute. Drilling as well, these lumpsum turnkey contracts, our key revenue and bottom line drivers. D&M is obviously the, drilling and measurement is the main driver of the performance of these projects, but all the other drilling segments have a role to play in it as well. So still a very good growth potential for drilling. On the characterization side, our exit out of the Western GECO acquisition business will have an impact on top line progression this year, but from a bottom line side, this should actually be quite accretive to a characterization of operating margins and both wireline and testing is kind of still operating around the close to the bottom of their cycle, mainly because their exposure to the exploration market has not seen any recovery yet, but there are some small signs of improving exploration spend relating to building in 2018, which should enable them to I think to grow as well. And on the Cameron side, we're seeing strong performance from the short cycle businesses and I think we're getting close to the trough of both the booking revenue and margins for the long cycle business. So again, upside there as well. So I think it's a bit more general, what I can say on the technology side, but I would say very good growth potential in all the four groups.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you. So that was the last caller for today. Thank you very much for participating.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude the conference for today. Thanks for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today’s call is being hosted in Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, New Ventures. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which, we will open up for questions. For today’s agenda, Simon will first present comments on our fourth quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro. However, before we begin, I’d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we’ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our full and fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.48. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and $0.21 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $2.01 of impairment and restructuring charges and $0.05 of Cameron and OneStim merger and integration charges. We also recorded a $0.05 charge relating to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Of the $3 billion of pre-tax charges, approximately two-third relating to our exit from the seismic acquisition business and the write-down of our investment in Venezuela. Paal will discuss the background and rationale behind the exit of seismic acquisition business. As a result of the recent political and economic events in Venezuela, we wrote down our investment in Venezuela. Importantly, we will continue to maintain our presence in Venezuela, and we will continue to work to collect all amounts owed to us. However, from an accounting standpoint, we believe taking the write-down at this time is the right thing to do. As it relates to merger and integration charges, this will be the last quarter we call out this item separately. Further details regarding all of the Q4 charges can be found in the FAQ at the back of our earnings press release. Our fourth quarter revenue of $8.2 billion increased 3.5% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margins increased 99 basis points to 10.2%. Highlights by product group were as follows: Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 7.5% sequentially as a result of a change in estimate on a long-term project accounted for under the percentage of completion, offset in part by higher software and multi-client sales. Margins expanded 441 basis points to 22%, primarily due to increased contribution from software and multi-client sales as well as the impact of the accounting from the previously mentioned project. Drilling Group revenue of $2.2 billion increased by 3% sequentially, while margin increased 43 basis points to 14.6% due to strong M-I SWACO sales in Mexico and North America land. Production Group revenue of $3.1 billion increased 7% sequentially, while margin increased 39 basis points to 10.2%. These results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity in North America land and internationally in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Argentina. Cameron Group revenue of $1.4 billion increased 9% sequentially, driven by growth in all product lines, particularly OneSubsea. Although margins for the group decreased by 58 basis points OneSubsea margins exceeded 20% for the sixth consecutive quarters. However, due to a decline in backlog, the OneSubsea margins are expected to be below 20% next quarter. The book-to-bill ratio for our long cycle business was 0.6 in Q4. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 19% in the fourth quarter compared to 18.4% in the previous quarter. Let me now provide you some color on the impact of U. S. tax reform on Schlumberger. As a non-U.S. company, our tax results is in us largely paying taxes where we work and earn profits without having to incur additional layer of taxes. Given the structure, the primary impact of U.S. reform on Schlumberger is that the lower federal tax rate of 20% will be applied to income earned by our U.S. business. Absent the impact of U.S. tax reform, our ETR likely would increase by approximately 2 to 3 percentage points in 2018 as compared to our Q4 ETR due to the higher profitability we expect in North America in 2018. However, the impact of U.S. tax reform is expected to largely offset this increase. As a result, we expect Schlumberger's full year 2019 ETR will be more or less in line with Q4 2017 ETR. During 2017, we returned $3.7 billion of tax to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback. As you know, our policy is to review dividend with our Board every January. Based on this review, we have decided to maintain our dividend at $0.50 per quarter. Paal will elaborate on this. We generated $5.7 billion of cash flow from operations for the full year 2017 and $2.3 billion during the fourth quarter. As a result, we achieved our cash flow generation target for the year. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $455 million during 2017 and $108 million during the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report that cash collection in Ecuador during the quarter were very strong. As a result, our receivable balance in the country at the end of 2017 was significantly lower than it was at this time last year. Our net debt increased by $900 million during the quarter to $13.1 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $5.1 billion. During the quarter, we spent $101 million to increase - to repurchase 1.6 million shares at an average price of $64.82. For the full year 2017, we spent $969 million to repurchase 13.2 million shares at an average price of $73.11. And now, I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.
Patrick Schorn: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk you through our geographical performance of the fourth quarter. Looking at North America, revenue grew 8% sequentially, driven by a further increase in land activity as well as improved pricing. This despite a 1% decrease in the frac market stage count. The Production Group OneStim hydraulic fracturing operations benefited from a full quarter of activity for the fleets we activated in the third quarter as well as additional fleets redeployments in the fourth. Profitability also improved as pricing increased. Vertical integration continued to reduce supply chain costs and the impact of transitory and reactivation costs abated. The Drilling Group sales of directional drilling technologies and M-I SWACO products and services increased sequentially as customer demand for longer laterals remain strong. Cameron Surface and Drilling Systems products and services were also in higher demand throughout the quarter. At the end of December, we concluded the transaction with Weatherford, most as a joint venture, as originally envisaged, but as a straight purchase of 1 million hydraulic horsepower. This deal will further enable margin expansion of the Schlumberger OneStim business in North America, a business we started over 12 months ago focused on providing an integrated completion of fracturing offering in young conventional market. The acquisition of these assets broadens and strengthens the OneStim footprint in the U.S., and we see outside ownership as a positive, not only through the flexibility and independence it offers, but also the seamless integration opportunities it brings with other products of our offering such as coil tubing and the Cameron service and frac flow businesses. The progress of the OneStim business over the past year is married by the success of new contract awards. For example, we have just signed an MOU with Oxy for a five year service partnership in the Aventine project in New Mexico's Delaware basin. Our joint objective is to reduce the cost per barrel in the safest and most efficient way possible. Pending final contract negotiation, the agreement includes a minimum scope of 700 wells, exclusivity of services and construction of a Schlumberger facility within the Oxy acreage. Offshore revenue in North America also increased as year-end sales of WesternGeco multi-client seismic licenses was stronger-than-expected. Activity in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico shifted to work over during the fourth quarter and will return to drilling in the first quarter of 2018, which includes activity on the Mad Dog 2 awards from BP for five to eight wells that we highlighted in this quarter's release. This award is in addition to the earlier awards to OneSubsea for the corresponding subsea installations. Internationally, fourth quarter revenue grew 2%. This was driven by strong growth in the Latin America area and a sustained growth in the Middle East and Asia area. These positive effects were partially offset by seasonal weakness in the Europe, CIS and Africa Area. In 2018, the international market will return to growth for the first time since 2014 and the projected activity growth is now leading us to start the reactivation of equipments to meet new contract start-ups. In addition to this, we're also starting to reposition equipment in the International Areas in general and to Russia in the Middle East, in particular, where activity is strongest and where we can secure the best returns. Both the reactivation and repositioning will result in increased short-term costs, which we except to absorb in the first quarter of this year. In Latin America, revenue increased 9% sequentially, driven by Argentina and Colombia. In Argentina, the growth was driven by Production Group activity for unconventional resource development with increased stage count and profit sales. In addition, we also began the first well on the YPF Bandurria Sur project. Drilling & Measurements in Colombia benefited from stronger activity for Ecopetrol. Revenue in Mexico and Central America was lower despite the growth in land development drilling works for both PEMEX and a number of local operators due to the absence of the strong multi-client seismic license sales seen in the third quarter. SPM project revenue was essentially flat in Ecuador, where we collected the further payment during the quarter, bringing the total receipt to $720 million, inclusive of the $300 million in bonds received from Petroamazonas that we monetized in December. We expect further payments early in 2019. In the Middle East and Asia area, revenue increased 2% sequentially on strong IPS project work in Saudi Arabia. Much of this was the result of improved efficiency and unconventional research developments but performance also increased on conventional loan security projects. Looking forward a little, we were awarded two new lump-sum contracts for drilling, rigs and services covering up to 146 gas wells and up to 128 oil wells. Project mobilization and start-up will begin in the first quarter. Elsewhere in the Middle East, activity was higher for Drilling & Measurements in Qatar and Kuwait, where IDS efficiency delivered additional wells. Also, as already mentioned, RCT revenue declined from a long-term construction projects in the region. In Iraq, signs of increased activity are emerging in the north with at least one major IOC expected to resume activity during the first quarter. In the south of the country, we have made further market share gains with additional awards of IDS contracts. With the onset of winter, activity was lower in the Europe, CIS and Africa with revenue declining a modest 2%. Seasonal effects were mainly seen in China, the North Sea GeoMarket and in Continental Europe, although these were partially offset by stronger SIS software sales and increased product sales from the drilling and production groups. Sub-Saharan Africa revenue declined with lower activity in Congo while in Libya, onshore drilling activity resumed us the security situation continues to improve. Weather in Russia and Central Asia region mainly affected wireline, although this was partially offset by record highway stimulation operations as well as sales of SAS software and Artificial Lift products. Secondly, it was also lower as the summer campaign ended, but completions high-end products sales mitigated this effect. The Caspian and Kazakhstan declined, although new contracts begin early in the first quarter were awarded for operations in both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Looking ahead, in other parts of the area, there have been a number of acreage acquisitions by international operators in Sub-Saharan and Africa on the back of record low reserve additions with development acreage changing hands. This will translate to new activity in 2018, particularly in Tanzania and Gabon. Some of these new projects have already less the new project awards that favor our integrated service capability. For example, we have just been awarded a services contract for an offshore project in Gabon to oversee well construction services. At the same time, Borr Drilling has been awarded the rig contract. We see alignment of this type as being one of the next steps in being able to provide more efficient drilling operations. And with that, I pass the call to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Patrick. 2017 marked the beginning of the oil market recovery with supply and demand moving into balance and oil prices steadily increasing over the course of the year. Our revenue grew 9% and ended up just north of $30 billion, driven by strengthening land activity in North America and by the Cameron acquisition, where we exceeded the synergy target start at the close of the transaction in 2016. Our approach through the past three years of unprecedented downturn has been to careful navigate the difficult commercial landscape, seizing strategic M&A opportunities, continuing the commitment to our transformation program and further broadening our extensive technology portfolio through organic R&D investments. Throughout this challenging period, we have continued to evaluate the effectiveness and competitiveness of all parts of the company and proactively restructure the elements we deemed necessary. In line with this, we took a further charge in the fourth quarter amounting to $3 billion and I would now like to give you the rationale behind the largest element of this, which is our decision to exit the seismic acquisition business. Given our history and market position, this has not been an easy decision to make. But following a careful evaluation of the current market trends, our customers buying habits and other current and projected financial returns, it is unfortunately and inevitable outcome. Geophysical measurements serve design and seismic operations have been an essential part of Schlumberger and our R&D efforts for more than 30 years. And today, we remain the industry seismic technology leader with a unique position in terms of intellectual property as well as engineering and manufacturing capabilities. Our IsoMetrix Marine acquisition system remains unrivaled and represents one of the biggest engineering achievements in the history of our company. Still has a downturn in the seismic data acquisition business now enters its sixth year. The present outlook provides no line of sight to a market recovery. It has also become clear to us that our customers are unwilling to pay a premium for our differentiated seismic measurement and surveys, and they clearly believe that generic technology and performance is sufficient. In general, this approach commoditize the seismic data acquisition business and creates a very low technical barrier to entry for smaller players, who steadily adds vessels and keep the market in a chronic state of overcapacity. We are therefore reached the conclusion that the seismic acquisition business cannot provide the full-cycle returns we require in terms of operating margins, free cash flow generation and return on capital employed nor can it compete for our internal allocation of R&E funding for capital investments. This challenging commercial environment is today clearly reflected in the financial statements of all the standalone seismic acquisition players, who are either at/or close to bankruptcy, heavily burned by weak cash flow and high debt. And while standalone seismic acquisition players have no other choice than to stay in and fight on to avoid bankruptcy while hoping for a better future, we, at Schlumberger, do have a choice, and we choose to exit the commoditized land and Marine acquisition business. Meanwhile, rapid advances and high-performance computing data analytics and machine learning have enhanced the value of seismic, imaging and visualization, enabling us to extract significantly higher value from our previous acquired data. Going forward, WesternGeco therefore adopts an asset-light model built on our strong multi-client, data processing and interpretation businesses, and further supported by our close partnerships with a leading company in cloud and high-performance computing. As a result, our reconstituted seismic business will going forward require half the capital investments and yield twice the free cash flow conversion and making it accretive to the cash returns of the company. In the coming quarters, we will, of course, honor all our existing land and Marine acquisition contract and customer commitment, but we have already stopped our participation in new bids. We are currently evaluating options for divesting our acquisition business and as we go through this process, we will call back our equipment as we complete our ongoing contractual commitments. Given the week financial state of the other seismic acquisition players and the absence of a clear line of sight to a recovery in the seismic market, we are prepared for the divestiture process to take some time and that we may end up selling our acquisition business to a new market entrant. Next, let's turn to the oil market, where demand amount outlook continues to be strong fueled by robust economic growth with the latest forecast showing upward GDP revisions in both the U.S. and Europe and with India continuing to surprise to the upside. On the supply side, the OPEC and Russian land production cuts were extended to the end of 2018 and more importantly, compliance remains at/or above 100%. This is translating into higher-than-expected inventory growth with U.S. stocks quickly approaching the five-year average and brent related inventories already well below. At the same time, floating storage has been more or less eliminated. All of this means that after a full year of waiting, the oil market is now substantially rebalanced. This is also reflected in the oil market sentiment, but we currently are witnessing a gradual shift from an oversupply discount towards the restoration of a market tightness premium with any geopolitical or operational disruption creating further upward movement in the oil price. In North America, shale oil production has responded as expected in 2017, with strong growth seen in the fourth quarter following the ramp up of drilling and completion activity earlier in the year. Looking forward to 2018, some of the U.S. E&Ps are still indicating that they will invest within cash flow in coming year. However, with a positive oil market sentiments and the increased availability of cash, we expect another year of robust growth in North America shale oil production, which will be required to maintain the balance in the global oil market. The reason for this is that the aging production base in Latin America, Africa and Asia continues to show underlying production decline after three years of unprecedented underinvestment. In 2018, this trend will again be marked by close to 2 million barrels of loan cycle production additions from investments made in the previous up cycle. These production tailwinds are expected to drop by around 1 million barrels per day in 2019, which means that the affected decline in the rest of the growth significant acceleration in 2019 and beyond even if investment levels start increasing in 2018. These positive oil market sentiments are also reflected in the E&P outlook, where the third-party surveys predict another 15% to 20% increase in North America investments in 2018 while the international market is poised for growth for the first time in four years with a forecast of 5% increase in E&P spend. From the Schlumberger side, we expect 2018 to be another year of strong growth in North America land, driven by further market share gains in both hydraulic fracturing and drilling as we deploy another 1 million horsepower and continue the capacity ramp up of our currently sold out rotary steerables and drillbit technologies. In the international market, we expect growth in all regions in 2018 for the first time since 2014. Spearheaded by solid underlying activity increases and market share gains in the Middle East, Russia, Asia and the North Sea while we expect more nominal growth rates in Latin America and Africa. The return to broad-based growth in international market represents a significant boost to our earnings power due to our unrivaled leadership position in all parts of this market in terms of both market share and profitability. The significance of it is best illustrated by the fact that we generate four to five times higher earnings for each incremental customer that was spent in the international market compared to the incremental customer dollars spent in North America. So after three very tough years, it is now clear that the tide is clearly turning in favor of Schlumberger. Moving closer at the first quarter, this will be a transitory quarter for us, where we expect the sequential decline in EPS to be $0.02 to $0.03 more than the normal seasonal growth. This is driven by the increased relative signs of our businesses in Russia and the North Sea, the need to absorb exceptional cost-related through reactivation of idle capacity due to recent contract wins as well as noticeable equipment repositioning cost as we shift more of our international capacity towards the Middle East and Russia. We expect to absorb the majority of these exceptional costs in the first quarter, and we are already seeing a strong acceleration in operating income growth in the second quarter. Turning next the capital allocations. We plan to tackle the 2018 activity growth without an increase in CapEx from the $2 billion levels seen in 2016 and 2017 as we again start to benefit from improved asset utilization on the back of our transformation program. These investments will be lower in 2018 as we focus on monetizing the strong library we have already bid. And for SPM, we have reached the end of our counter cyclical business development program and are now shifting our full attention towards project execution. This means that capital investment levels will be down in 2018 and that our SPM business will generate positive free cash flow in the coming year. In terms of capital allocations over its M&A activity, the only major transaction we are currently pursuing is depending EDC transaction and Russia, We remain optimistic that we will ultimately receive the needed regulatory approvals. As for dividends, we decided based on the current payout ratio to maintain our dividend at the current level for another year and instead return excess cash to our shareholders in the coming year through our existing buyback program. As we eagerly enter the first year of growth in all parts of our global operations since 2014, our entire organization remains committed to delivering market-leading products and services to our customers and superior returns to our investors, driven by our ability to win our customers work and deliver strong incremental margins and free cash flow. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hi. Good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, James.
James West: Great to hear your confidence about the international recovery and that getting underway. It looks we've already seen a little bit of that so far. I know Patrick outlined just a slew of contract wins that have already happened and I know that there's a lot of tenders out there, more are coming. It seems to be a global in nature. And you highlighted some transitory parts of 1Q, but how should we think about the rollout of international revenue or the contracts coming in and starting up as we go through 2018 and 2019? And kind of where do we see the inflection [hire] [ph] for international?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think if you look at the progression of 2019, I think I'll limit my comments to that. Like I said, the first quarter will be – we will see a lot of the start-up of these new contract wins. So in terms of revenue, we will have an impact of seasonality given the relative higher share of Northern Hemisphere business at this stage. And then it will be start-up cost and mobilizations that we're going to focus on in the coming quarters. So in terms of revenue progression, I think you will see the first quarter of significant acceleration in revenue in the second quarter followed again by a very strong growth also into the third quarter. So the year will have a somewhat slow start with seasonality with start-up costs and mobilizations in the first and then followed by strong growth in the subsequent quarters.
James West: Okay. That's very helpful. And then with respect to the first quarter, normally, there's about 10% decline or so for Schlumberger's earnings, yet that's in the normalized year-over-year, you have a lot of back and forth quarter sales and see the drop-off there. Should we think about something in that range? Or will it be maybe more of a pronounced decline at 1Q and then more of a jump in 2Q because of these staging and the preparation? 
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah, I think from an overall activity standpoint, I mean, we – I think about 10% reduction in EPS is a good benchmark for that. On top of that, we will have, I would say, two three additional sense of one-time costs lead to the reactivation as well as repositioning of equipment. But I think the 10% number is a good guide for the traditional seasonality with a couple of extra cents on additional costs.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Angie.
Angie Sedita: So a little bit of color may be on the evolution of OneStim in regards to Completions and started up how you'd like to build that business out over time, have a vertically-integrated business. What product lines are you missing? And what's the timeframe do you think you could see for that business to be built out to way that you would like it to well-rounded full product suite, et cetera?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So for the multi-stage completion business for U.S. land, we do have a more or less complete offering. There's a few small pieces that we're missing that we have. We're working on organically. But in terms of overall, we have the products that we need in the market. We have a presence in the market, although it is not very high. So what we are in full swing of doing now is to step up both supply chain and manufacturing as well as sales of this offering. And we will now tie it very closely to the deployment of additional horsepower. We obviously have ramped up significantly already in 2017. So we have a very aggressive growth plan for the multi-stage completion offering that we already have in-house, and we will look to penetrate significantly into the OneStim frac fleet that we already have in operation as well as the additional fleets that we will put into play in 2018.
Angie Sedita: Okay, okay, fair enough. And then the reference to SPM being potentially done. I mean, previously, you were commenting there could be as many as two to four project announced in the next one to two quarters. Now the oil prices have moved higher, transaction costs have like also moved higher. Do you still expect two to four more projects to be announced or are you done at least for 2018?
Paal Kibsgaard: Patrick, you want to comment on that?
Patrick Schorn: Yes. So I think in general, Angie, SPM continues to be a growth engine for the company in the coming years. But at this stage, we have reached the end of what we call our countercyclical business development program, and we are really shifting our attention to project execution. Going forward, SPM will generate positive cash flow, and therefore, we'll be able to fund future investments and potential expansion. So I would really characterize this as a very disciplined growth going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: Paal, with SPM being deemphasized to a degree with higher crude prices and you guys have made very good progress on the transformation, we started to receive a few questions from investors regarding what is Schlumberger's main growth strategy from here, what are the main initiatives to execute on that growth strategy? I have an answer, but given rising investor interest in Schlumberger and probably more people tuning into this call, I think it would be useful to if you just for a minute or two, from a higher level, if you could briefly discuss the overarching strategy of the company going forward and the key initiatives to execute on that strategy.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say that, if you look at what we've done over the past three years in the down cycle, we have two acquisitions, in particular, Cameron and through the combined I would say a number of small acquisitions within land drilling and organic investments, we have increased our addressable market with around 50%. So we have now a very complete portfolio within rest of our characterization, within all aspects of drilling, within all aspects of production, with an increased presence and U.S. land as well, and we’ve added Cameron to the lineup in 2016. So our strategy going forward is very clearly that we want to now increase our market share, increase our participation in all aspects of the global business. We have a fantastic presence in the international market, which are now just returning to growth. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, our earnings power internationally is four to five times higher than what it is in the North America land. So our strategy is very clear, it hasn't changed. We will continue to participate in all the major markets around the world. And we are very excited about the growth opportunities now that international is providing us. And again, the earnings power we have in these markets.
Scott Gruber: Got it. That's helpful. And then just with regard to the 5% market growth rate expectation in 2018, given the past investments in the SPM projects coming online, how do you think your international revenues trend relative to that market growth rate?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think, overall, our objective is to outgrow the overall market in any part of the growth, right? So I would say that if the international E&P spend growth ends up being 5%, our goal is to outperform it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
James Wicklund: Good morning guys. Paal, it's all positive in terms of the outlook. We all know that you guys and everybody else has said that international drilling activity had kind of bottomed mid-last year, but we're warned that pricing pressure continued. Has the pricing pressure abated any? And where is pricing today versus 2014 broadly in the international sector? And I guess, it matters most in Russia, Saudi and the North Sea. Can you talk about pricing internationally since spending is going to up in the rig count bottom that seems to be the most critical issue right now?
Paal Kibsgaard: It's a fair question, Jim. Obviously, we have a very clear view on pricing, and we have a very good handle on pricing. At this stage, I don't really want to go into what we think about pricing or how we're going to play pricing. This is very sensitive and very close to how we are running the business. So I'd rather keep those views to myself. Other than that, we have a very clear view on what they are doing w e are going to do going forward.
James Wicklund: Has it quick going down at least generally per industry?
Paal Kibsgaard: I'm going not to stick to what is said. I think the overall in any part of the world remain competitive really at any stage of the cycle. The question is are you pushing pricing up, are you looking for market share? I'm not saying that we are doing either of those two things other than what we have a very good handle on what to do with pricing, and we view this as a competitive advantage through how we are going to perform in the market going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Good morning. Paal, if you could speak to the expected cadence of deployment and reactivation of the Weatherford frac fleet over the 2018 timeframe and then more over, if you could also speak to what you expect the total reactivation cost of the fleet to be as well and whether you expect all 20 of these fleets to be working by the culmination at the end of this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. If you look at what we did in 2017, we basically reactivated around 1 million-horsepower or slightly north of 20 fleets in 2017 of our own capacity. We are now more or less fully deployed, and we had challenges early on with the reactivation and getting everything out. There is a lot of hiring, there's a lot of new things to take on as to massively ramp up as we did. But at least, we have gotten the hang of it. So our plan is to do exactly the same in 2018. So we would be deploying the additional 1 million-horsepower over the course of 2018 and although it's not going to be a completely straight line, I think fairly close to a straight line over the course of the year, I think is a good assumption.
Bill Herbert: Got it. And do you have sort of gas I mean, I'm sure you've done work, but do you want to reveal it in terms of what you expect the reactivation cost to be?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So for the horsepower that we bought from Weatherford, we expect the total reactivation cost to be in the range of $100 million, which is factored into our CapEx guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hi, good morning. Thank you for all that color.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Kurt Hallead: Interesting stuff going on here especially on the international front for sure. So Paal, a lot of focus and attentions on a very near-term numbers on the quarter I don't want to read too much into your commentary, but it sounds to me like the benefit you're going to get from the start ups post first quarter should more than offset the greater than seasonal drop in the first quarter. So on a full year basis, I'd have to assume that the street consensus numbers look pretty solid where they are right now. Can you provide some commentary on that?
Paal Kibsgaard: We generally don't give annual guidance, so I'm not going to step into that. I would just reiterate my commentary that Q1 is transitory. We are not suggesting anything else than that. We have normal seasonal decline, we have some additional costs related to repositioning and reactivation, and we expect very strong growth in earnings, both in the Q2 and Q3 coming after.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, that's fair enough. I appreciate that. So on the international front, you're mentioning that the earnings contribute 4 to 5x more than that in North America. Is that a true cycle number, Paal? Or you kind of comparing what was transpiring during the kind of peak activity levels for international in North America?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, this is the full cycle comparison of our North American operations versus our international operations, full cycle.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, great, awesome. That’s it for me. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Hi, good morning. Paal, so you said in the past that doing nothing is not a strategy with the write-down in marine and seismic acquisition. So another move where you address your strategy on the business not meet acceptable returns SPM is the other obvious example. I was wondering if you could just kind of help us understand kind of bigger picture where you think Schlumberger's normalized returns should end up say compared to last cycle? Kind of excluding a big ramp up in pricing with your new kind of more asset-light model, can you get back to those levels? Are you targeting it back to kind of high teens returns maybe just kind of talk about just in general how you're thinking about that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah, we are for sure targeting that. I think our goal is to beat the margins we had in the previous cycle and obviously peak higher and then whenever the inevitable next cycle starts, that we also profiler. So we have very clear plans in place for how we're going to do that both when it comes operating margins, when it comes to free cash flow generation as well as a return on capital employed.
David Anderson: And then one other thing if I could just go back to another comment you made in the past about not getting paid for technology in certain markets and therefore you pulled back until those customers come back to you. Has your mindsets changed at all on that? Have you seen shift from customers on how they're viewing technology today? I'm just kind of wondering how you’re thinking about R&D spending over next few years. Obviously, came down quite a bit this year. How should we think about where that number goes for the next few years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we haven’t changed our position in terms of wanting to get paid for our technology and in the markets where we are not going to get paid for our differentiated technology, we will provide market performance in those markets. Right? But I would say that the conversation is starting to shift in many of the markets around the world now towards technology, towards differentiated technologies and towards overall service and product performance. And this is, obviously, something that favors us. I think even in North America land, as we go into 2019, there is a growing focus from the customer base on both drilling and hydraulic fracturing efficiencies. So we want basically more well spots per rigs per year, and we want more stages per fleet per month, right? So all of these elements favors differentiated technologies, individuals technologies as well as our integrated offering, both when it comes to drilling and stimulation. So in terms of R&D spend, we have taken the R&D spend down gradually over the course of this downturn. We don't have plans for 2018 to increase it significantly, but we have plans in place in the following years as to what we would direct the spend towards when the market permits those to increase spend.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Igor Levi from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Igor Levi: Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Igor Levi: So I remember early in the downturn when you were first giving international price concessions, you had mentioned that these concessions have mechanism of reversing when oil price trigger points were hit. And I know you don't want to provide details on pricing itself, but could we assume that with oil in the high 60s that some of those mechanisms are being triggered?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. I think generally for those mechanisms, if you look at the bidding activity that we've gone through say over the past year and are still ongoing at this stage most of the contracts that those mechanisms were tagged on to are now being replaced by new bids. So I don't expect there to be a significant number of contracts where we still have those mechanisms in place that generally replaced by new contracts that have been competitively bid over the past year and it's still being awarded as we speak.
Igor Levi: Great. And how should we think about modeling the impact of your exit from the seismic acquisition business on 2018 results relative to what that business earned in 2017?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think if you look at the impact in Q4, there is some D&A impact. And beyond that, I think, obviously, it will be less capital intensive going towards. I would say lower CapEx, higher free cash conversion and some positive impact from D&A. Beyond that, that's it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Waqar Syed: Thank you. Paal, my question is regarding the OneSubsea segments. One of the – your competitors have come up with more compact systems that can way sharply reduce customer cost. What's the Schlumberger's answer to this new introduction of new systems into the subsea?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, from the OneSubsea side, we have, over the past three years, done a lot on reducing the overall cost space and the capital intensity, the size on the equipment that we provide. So I mean this is nothing new for us, we've already made significant investments into this. We are quite competitive when it comes to all aspect of this, right? So this is already being going on within OneSubsea for a number of years. And if you look at some of the awards we've had in the past 12 months that's coming out as a direct consequence of being very competitive when it comes to cost and also standardization of the equipment that we're providing our solutions to our customers. So there's nothing new for us, we've already being working on this, and continue to work on it.
Waqar Syed: And what's your view on the outlook for offshore project FIDs with regards to primarily subsea orders, inventories or other subsea spending?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I don't have a specific number to give you on the number of projected fee awards other than that it set to be up in 2018. I think overall number of FIDs offshore as well is on the positive trend. So we are optimistic and excited about the offshore market as well as overall, the international market going into 2018.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jud Bailey: Thanks. Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Jud Bailey: Good morning. A question on margins, Paal. With revenue growth probably old markets looks like they're going to be probably in the right direction next year. In the past, you've talked about generating – getting back to generating very high incremental margins in the 60-plus percent range. With revenue growth starting to turn the corner in most of your markets, is that still a reasonable expectation at some point in the future? And just in general, how should we think about incremental margins this year with the revenue growth probably going to happen from the spending that we see in your piece this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. So for 2019, we target to increasing incremental margins in all aspects of our business around the world. I'm not sure that 65% incrementals in 2018 is that realistic because we will require a fair bit of pricing to reach those levels, but I've always said that 65% is achievable, good pricing. So we will have to see how the market pans out in terms of pricing. But absent pricing, I think it's going to be tough to get the 65%, but we for sure going to improve over the incremental margins that we delivered in 2017.
Jud Bailey: Is that still a reasonable goal if we continue to see growth in 2019, I guess? And I know you don't want to give guidance out that far, but just trying to get a sense that you'd still be once things are on we can get pass some activation cost and some of the transitory issues that the high incremental are something that you'd still be comfortable with a longer-term basis.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, absolutely. We are for sure targeting the 65% incrementals when we got into steady growth, when we get a bit of pricing tailwind. That ambition have not changed, and we are going to work towards achieving. Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Timna Tanners: Hey, good morning all. Wanted to ask if you could follow-up a little bit, please, on the SPM strategy. I appreciate that you're moving into harvest mode that makes a lot of sense. But can you help us with characterizing perhaps what might be the right investments were redeploying any of that cash and how we would look at those opportunities going forward?
Patrick Schorn: Yeah, it's maybe a little bit the same as what you already said. I think that we still believe that SPM is going to bed significant portion of our growth strategy going forward. But at the end, we want to make sure that we are very opportunistic in the deals that we bake. And at this stage, we have really reached the end of our countercyclical business development program. And going forward, we will be growing in a very disciplined manner. What that means is that we want SPM to be generating its cash that can use for future investment and potential expansion and that's – that is going to be the way on how we are going to be looking at project going forward. So SPM is key to what we do, and we have a very strong view on how we want to be investing our capital going forward.
Timna Tanners: Okay. I guess, you don't want to show your hands there too much. I'll shift to asking that question more to Simon about given the commentary about returning value to shareholders and buybacks and so on, can your mind as maybe some of your targets in terms of debt metrics and or cash on the balance sheet? Thanks.
Simon Ayat: So I think I won't – but no stopping – but you mentioned something about the cash on the balance sheet? This is Simon Ayat, by the way. Can you repeat your question, please?
Timna Tanners: So in light of the focus now on returning cash to shareholders and growth beyond the dividend, wanted to see if you could please remind us what your targets might be a regarding appropriate level of cash on the balance sheet and what your target debt metrics are? Thanks.
Simon Ayat: So you know our policy is to return capital through dividend and buy back. And we are in the market continuously on the buyback. From the remarks that I made, we spent almost $1 billion, we bought 13.2 million shares during 2017 and this has far exceeds the amount of shares we issued for the stock-based compensation. So our policy at the minimum, we will continue to buy back shares that we issue for the stock for the base compensation and any excess cash, and we will return it to our shareholders through buyback. The dividend policy is reviewed every year. As we said this January, we decided to stay at the same level and when the visibility is going to improve, we will certainly go back to increasing it. So our policy at the minimum is to return the shareholder any stock we issue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Michael LaMotte: When the OneStim was talked about as a joint venture, at one point you talked about operating fracs fleet as essentially two frac fleets or Schlumberger high tech and Weatherford base more conventional fleet vehicle, and I'm wondering now that you own 100% of it, these 20-plus incremental fleets this year, are they going to be more conventional spreads? Or are they going to have elements of the integrated field systems that you've been moving towards with OneStim?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I'm saying that for the underlying frac spread technology, we haven’t talked about any kind of differentiation in that. I think the equipment that we bought from Weatherford versus the equipment that we generally have ourselves is more or less the same. I think it's much more down to water pumping, the fluid systems, diversion and potentially going more to an integrated model. But I would say today, we operate with basically generic fluid systems, and we have more or less the standard business model that the industry uses for us. So there's really no difference in the way we are operating any of the frac spreads within OneStim today and that's going to change from a take onboard the additional 1 million horsepower from Weatherford, right? So we are happy to provide more of an integrated package including both pump down perforating and multi-stage completions, and that's what we are going to be promoting in our contract with our customers, right? But for the ones that want to buy the individual pieces, we would continue to do that and that is still a lion's share of how we operate today.
Michael LaMotte: Okay. And then do you mind addressing some of the bottlenecks that you're seeing in the U.S. land market today? Obviously, labor is one that we hear a lot about, but I'm thinking more on the logistic side, in particular?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I think where the substantial growth that the industry has seen, and obviously, we have seen it and more so in the past year, and that's going to continue into 2018. There are bottlenecks in many parts of the value chain, right? But through diverse integration program, we have now been able to streamline a lot of the aspects all the way from the sand mind, to the railcars, to the transload and even then at the last mile through owning of fair bit of our own last mile trucking. So that's getting ironed out and I think the other aspect of challenges as well as that while the service industries has to ramp up their capacity and readiness, the same has gone for the customers. And I would say that there hasn’t always been perfect synchronization in between our operations and customers where you get inefficiencies from waiting on water, waiting for the valve to be ready and so forth. So I think there's also a significant part of how we are going to be looking to try to streamline operations, to drive efficiency and further drive profitability in the year to come. But all of these things are in the works. We know where the bottlenecks are, and we have I would say active programs to address all of these in the coming year.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Thank you. Good morning. So Paal with international activities set to improve you are losing some markets and you highlighted your core CapEx becoming flat again therefore still well below your core D&A. I'm just curious if you could expand on how much your efficiency efforts can continue to drive that lower spend? And what would it take for you in terms of the environment in order to really step it up meaningfully?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I mean, we're basically saying that we can keep our CapEx for field equipment flat in 2018 versus 2017. And it's began driven by the fact that we have in our view significant upside potential when it comes to the utilization of the existing asset base. So I don't see this as a one year benefit. We have this program going on, which I think will benefit those for a number of years going forward. So while I'm not going to make any prediction to field equipment CapEx for 2019 already at this stage, but for growth rate that are in the range of what we're seeing now, we can continue to do this for a number of years going forward. So we have significant capacity upside from the existing asset base, and we are going to try to drive utilization up and have a significant tailwind to our current capital employed by not having to spend a lot of CapEx on replenishing the field operation.
Sean Meakim: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful feedback. And just thinking about North American onshore beyond pressure pumping some of the other completion and production service lines, how do you see the supply and demand and ultimately pricing for those other related product lines, cementing, core tubing even more pressure flow back break it here in your commentary there?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think as activity will continue to increase, we expect to see growth and pricing opportunities for all the surrounding activities around fracking as well as on all aspects of drilling as well, right? And the last part, which we don't talk a lot about on these calls, is the Artificial Lift business, but we also have a very strong presence both when it comes to DSPs and price right? So for all aspect of our business in U.S. and going forward, we are very positive on both activity and pricing opportunity.
Simon Ayat: So thank you for that final question. I would now like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed this morning. First, the oil market is now balanced as a result of continued strong demand growth and the supply side characterized by production cuts, led by OPEC in Russia and the weakening global production base. So even the robust growth from North America shale oil production in 2019, global supply responses will be increasingly needed to balance the market going forward, which, again, means the return to growth for all parts of our business. Second, the positive sentiment in the oil market are already reflected in that 2019 E&P spend forecast where the third-party surveys indicate growth of 15% to 20% in North America and 5% internationally. This is highly favorable to Schlumberger as our international earnings power is four to five times higher than what we see in North America. Last, our approach the past three years has been to broaden our technology portfolio, leverage our transformation program and restructure our organization to be ready for the inevitable market recovery. We are excited about the outlook, and we are ready to deliver the best products and services to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders. Thank you very much for participating in the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2017 earnings call. Today’s call is being hosted from New York, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice-President New Ventures. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we will open up for questions. For today’s agenda, Simon will first today comment on our third quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paul will close our remarks with the discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro. However, before we begin I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we’ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K fillings and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow more time for others who maybe in the queue. Now, I’ll hand the call over to Simon Ayat.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.42. This represents an increase of $0.07 sequentially and $0.17 when compared to the same quarter last year.  During the quarter, we recorded a $0.03 of Cameron merger and integration charges. Our third quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 6% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margins increased 103 basis points to 9.2%. Highlights by product group were as follows: Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.8 billion increased 1% sequentially, while margin increased 56 basis points to 17.6%, primarily due to strong wireline activity, largely in Russia and Central Asia. Drilling Group revenue of $2.1 billion increased by 1% sequentially, while margins of 14.2% were essentially flat as directional drilling activity on land in North America continue to improve.  Production Group revenue of $2.9 billion increased 15% sequentially, while margin expanded by 62 basis points to 9.8%. These results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity in North America land. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion increased 3% sequentially, while margin increased 61 basis points to 13.8%. These results were largely driven by higher product sales in surface systems in North America. One, Subsea margins exceeded 20% for the 5th straight quarter. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle business was 0.8 in Q3. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 18.4% in the third quarter compared to 18.9% in the previous quarter.  We generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations during the quarter. This included a federal tax refund in the U.S. working capital consume $134 million of cash, largely due to the increase in activity. Working capital also reflected the payment of $114 million in severance during the quarter. We remain on track to achieve our cash flow generation target for the year. Our net debt improved by $385 million during the quarter to $12.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $5 billion.  During the quarter, we spend $98 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $66.04. As we previously highlighted, we have reduced our buyback activity during the quarter in light of the pending OneStim and EDC transactions, as well as various SPM opportunity. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $600 million on CapEx and investments of approximately $165 million in SPM projects. During the quarter we also made $693 million of dividend payments. Full year 2017 CapEx excluding SPM and multiclient investments is now expected to be approximately $2.1 billion. And now I would turn the conference over to Patrick. 
Patrick Schorn: Thank you, Simon and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were solid, driven by the strength of the North America land market and by growth in key international markets, like Russia, the North Sea and Asia. Elsewhere activity was largely flat sequentially. The quarter’s performance was led by the Production Group, with strong revenue growth in North America, as hydraulic fracturing activity continue to increase. The Middle East also contributed to the growth of the group, through increased activity on unconventional resources development projects. Reservoir Characterization Group results were higher on solid summer drilling campaigns in Russia and the North Sea. Although exploration related activity worldwide remained very weak. The Drilling Group also improved, driven by stronger directional drilling activity in North America, which more than offset the completion of integrated drilling services project in the Middle East and Mexico. At Cameron, OneSubsea continue to deliver strong margins for the 5th straight quarter. At the same time, CAMShale fluid delivery and fracturing services are now deployed on about half of all Schlumberger fracturing job in North America realizing one of the targeted synergy benefits of the acquisition. Looking at North America in detail, revenue grew 18% sequentially driven by continued growth for both our production and drilling related businesses, with our hydraulic fracturing revenue increasing 42% sequentially. Over the past two quarters, we have more than doubled the number of active frac fleets in the North America and we have at present deployed close to all of our idle capacity in preparation for the additional capacity that will become available after closing the OneStim transaction with Weatherford. While the strength in our hydraulic fracturing activity combined with market share gains and continued pricing traction drove significant sequential revenue growth for the production group in North America land it also inevitably led to some transition related cost and inefficiencies resulting from the rapid ramp up in activity, which impacted incremental margins. However, this impact will abate in the coming quarters. The Drilling Group product lines also benefited from the continued growth in North America land rig activity in the third quarter. Demands for our advanced road restorable systems remained at sold out levels as our customers continue to move towards longer laterals. Given the demand for our drilling technology offering, we have ramped up manufacturing capacity and will dedicate more CapEx towards the North America land drilling market in the coming years. Before I comment on the international markets, I would like to update you on our SPM project in North America, where we continue to make in-roads in the third quarter. After one year of operations on the SM Energy project in the Powder River Basin, we are currently drilling and completing the 11th well. The production wells we have designed drilled and completed all produced in the top quartile of the field driven by optimized well placement and an engineered approach to completion and stimulation. Based on the success of the partnership between SM Energy and SPM, we are making steps to develop the business model further in cooperation, alignment and scope. As announced at the end of the second quarter, we've also secured a new SPM project with Torxen in Western Canada where we started up operation in August with four wells drilled so far. Yesterday, we announced that we together with our partner Torxen also have acquired a neighboring Palliser Block making this project the largest in scope within our current portfolio. The SM Energy and Torxen projects demonstrated the SPM opportunity set that is available to us in North America. These projects also show how we are effectively diversifying and building out our SPM portfolio from the initial start in Malaysia, Romania and Ecuador where we created the technical and commercial expertise that today serves as the foundation for this new and exciting part of our offering. Internationally, revenue was up 2% sequentially excluding Cameron where the long cycle businesses as expected are still seeing noticeable sequential declines. Europe/CIS/Africa area revenue was 7% higher sequentially including Cameron due to strong summer activity in Russia and Central Asia, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and in Norway and Denmark. In Russia and Central Asia, land activity was very strong during the summer, driven by well construction services, wireline logging and artificial lift system sales. Russia is a strong market that steady adds reserves through the drill bits and our performance continues to benefit from the extensive investments we have made in the country in personnel, infrastructure, local manufacturing and support over the past 15 years. Activity in West Africa remained stable in the third quarter with limited additions to the rig count. However, project planning and tendering reached a two year high with new offshore project start-ups anticipated in early 2018. These projects are clear opportunities for our integrated drilling service product line and we continue to see an increasing interest for performance based drilling contract in shallow water including the jackup rig market. In North Africa activity remains low although we were able to return to drilling services and continue well intervention operations in Libya as security improved during the third quarter. Middle East and Asia area revenue was up 1% sequentially excluding Cameron as strong production and drilling group activity in the Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, Far East and Australia and South and East Asia GeoMarkets was largely offset by the completion of integrated drilling services projects in Iraq. Activity growth in Saudi Arabia was driven by improved productivity in our unconventional resources project, which enabled us to complete a higher stage count. However adverse weather which disrupted WesternGeco land seismic activity partially offset these gains. In Asia, activity strengthened in Indonesia on increasing rig count and market share, while Australia benefited from higher demand for hydraulic fracturing and drilling services. China improved with increased production services and higher seasonal activity and new technology deployments for shale and tight gas development. Revenue in the Latin America area decreased 5% sequentially excluding Cameron mainly due to lower multiclient seismic sales and the completion of integrated drilling services projects in the Mexico and Central America GeoMarket. Revenue in the North and South Latin America GeoMarkets was essentially flat with previous quarters with stable SPM project activity in Ecuador and as we prepared to start up our YPF SPM project towards the end of this year. As there has been a lot of attention around our SPM activity in Ecuador including recent reports with incorrect analysis and conclusions, let me close my remarks by clarifying where we currently stand. During the third quarter, we reached an agreement with our partners Petroamazonas and the government of Ecuador to settle our overdue receivable balance in the country. With the first payment milestones related to these discussions already completed during the quarter. Based on a joint review of the future development and investment plan for the field we've also revised the tariff relating to the Shushufindi contract and added a future severance payment guarantee. This was done to ensure that this long-term contract remains viable for both parties going forward. It is also important to point out that on a going forward basis the new terms of the Shushufindi contract still need our established investment criteria. At present, production from the Shushufindi field has been restored and is now in-line with the current reservoir performance potential. I now hand the call back to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Patrick. Before I comment on the business outlook, I would like to talk about technology. And in particular how we continue to build out our offering to create an unmatched upstream technology platform where the individual products and services has the industry’s lowest cost of ownership and where the collective offering is readymade for broad-based system integration. This direction will first ensure that we become even more competitive in the markets where the prevailing business model is focused on lowest price for basic standalone products and services. And second, it will enable us to better serve the growing number of customers who favor integrated and performance based contracts, which is directionally where we see the industry heading. This includes extending our ownership of hardware, software and domain expertise into new market segments. As well as teaming up with companies like Google and Microsoft to capitalize on the latest advances in digital technology enablement. So what is the basis for our pursuit of technology system integration and why do we see hardware ownerships as a critical element of this strategy? Today the broad and complex EMP industry workflows are still predominantly enabled by discrete and fragmented products and services with the dividing lines between the various work packages defined by our customers contracting framework, which was established decades ago. These artificial dividing lines make sense at the time of creation when the technology systems were made up of a limited number of isolated hardware building blocks and the value of software and data was still nascent. With the complexity of today’s oil field operations and the advances made in other industries in terms of total system performance, it is clear that replacing our industry’s fragmented approach with a new focus on complete technology systems holds a massive performance upside. In response to this we have over the past seven years continued to build out our technology offering in terms of hardware, software and domain expertise. Where we today have the ownership and technical capabilities to develop these complete technology systems, driven by the following key beliefs. First, we believe that innovating across the artificial dividing lines of today’s individual work packages to create hardware technology with a broader scope, a smaller footprint and fewer interfaces holds huge upside potential in terms of both hardware costs and performance. The way we are integrating and innovating around the drilling bottomhole assembly is an example of this.  Second, we believe that the next step change in industry performance will come from developing complete technology systems based on streamline and redefine end-to-end workflows, which integrates all hardware and software components. What we are doing with the rig of the future is an example of this. And third we believe that in order to maximize the performance of the EMP industry workflows it is essential to leverage the latest advances in digital technologies.  We achieve this by making these enabling technologies an integral part of the new hardware and software technology systems as opposed to attaching them on top of the outdated and fragmented technologies of yesterday. What we are doing with DELFI, which was introduced at the FAS Global Forum during the third quarter is an example of this. DELFI is our new cognitive E&P environment that leverages the latest advances in data security analytics, machines learning, high performance computing, as well as teamwork and collaboration to drive total system performance. The DELFI environment provides a new way of working for the asset teams by strengthening the integration between the technical domains and by enabling our customers and software partners throughout their own intellectual property and workflows through the system. With the launch of DELFI we have also deployed an E&P data lake on the Google Cloud platform comprising more than 1000 3D seismic surveys, 5 million wells, 1 million well logs and 400 million production records from around the world demonstrating a step change in system scalability. DELFI will ultimately cover all industry workflows however the initial focus is on drilling and well construction. In this respect the DrillPlan and DrillOps [ph] solutions will in the coming quarters be introduced to the market and this combined with our down hole hardware and the rig of the future will under the one drill offering create an unprecedented step change in drilling performance.  So this summarizes the strategic rationale behind our pursuit of technology system integration and also explains why we see hardware ownership as a critical element of the strategy. Our commitment to technology leadership is stronger than ever as can be seen by how we have advanced our technology strategy during the downturn of the past three years. We are now ready to capitalize on these investments in close collaboration with our customers. Let me next turn to the business environment where the reduction in global oil inventories in the third quarter clearly demonstrates that the oil market is now in balance, which is creating the required foundation for a further increase in the oil price and the inevitable growth in global E&P investments. And while the timing and pace of the pending industry recovery is still not completely clear we now see a number of converging market factors that make us increasingly positive about the outlook for our global business. First and foremost the growth in oil demand continues to be very strong and importantly the upward growth revisions in 2017 were primarily seen in the OACD countries. The demand growth outlook for 2018 is again expected to be north of 1.4 million barrels per day and is further supported by upward revisions in global GDP growth clearly suggesting that the demand side of the oil market equation is on a very solid footing. Looking closer at the global oil inventory, we also believe that the current situation is more positive than what is reflected by the market. Today global inventory levels are down to 64 days of forward cover and the North American stocks are already down to 2014 levels. Brent crude which is now in backwardation is seeing faster inventory draws and stocks are already approaching the five year average. In North America land where the E&P companies have added significant CapEx over the past year, the production growth is so far falling short of expectations, driven by supply chain inflation, operational inefficiencies and the need to step out from the Tier 1 acreage. This has led to a moderating investment appetite where the previous pursue to production growth is now being balanced out with an equal focus on generated solid financial returns and operating within cash flow. This moderation can be seen in the flattening trend of the U.S. land rig count during the third quarter and it is also reflected in our customers’ 2018 activity outlook. The more tempered activity outlook for U.S. land combined with the short cycle nature of the business has an immediate impact on the outlook for production growth, which for 2017 and 2018 has been revised down by 100,000 and 500,000 barrels per day respectively. This clearly has a material impacts on the global supply and demand balance. From the OPEC side compliance with the stated production cuts has been better than expected. At the same time comments from several of the key OPEC Gulf countries and from Russia suggest that an extension of the existing production cuts beyond the current agreement is a possibility although this may ultimately not be needed. Looking at the ongoing activity and investment levels in the international markets outside OPEC Gulf and Russia, we have so far seen very limited growth since we reached bottom of the cycle in the first quarter of this year. However, we’re seeing signs in many parts of the world of conventional land and offshore projects now being prepared for FID, and the total number of FIDs this year is double that of 2016. It is also worth noting that our overall tendering activity in the international markets is also up by over 50% in 2017 compared to last year, measured in total contract value. And we expect these positive trends to strengthen further in the coming quarters. Based on the combination of all these factors, we’re currently increasingly the positive on the overall outlook for our global business. It is still early to say what the specific impact on the 2018 E&P spend will be, as our customers are now in their planning process. But we do expect activity tailwinds in most part of the world in 2018. In the meantime, we’re fully focused on delivering industry leading products and services to our customers, and we also remain opportunistic with respect to making further strategic moves to position Schlumberger at the forefront of the industry as the global activity upturn slowly, but surely emerges. Before we open up for questions, which will likely initially be focus on SPM, let me again reiterate the rationale and objectives behind our SPM investments, which has not changed over the past two years. SPM will not alter the phase of Schlumberger it will simply complement our core business where the objective is to grow SPM from the size of a product line today to the size of a group over the next five to seven years. Granted SPM has a different risk profile compared to our core business, but different does not mean higher. The biggest risk to our full cycle returns in the core business is first the huge cost of scaling up and scaling down capacity in an increasingly volatile business environment. And second, failing to adjust our business approach in some of the large, but commoditized land markets around the world. Faced with these challenges, we’ve concluded that a strategy of doing nothing new is simply not a strategy. The SPM business model and contract duration significantly mitigates both of these core business risks, while in return we take on the reservoir risk and in certain cases higher counterparty risk. Our track record over the past 20 years of SPM activity shows that we’re very good at managing the reservoir risk and we’re also getting increasingly good at managing the counterparty party risk as demonstrated by how we have resolved the current and future payment situation in Ecuador. So, in short, SPM helps mitigate some of the major risks in our core business. At the same time, we know very well how to manage the new risk we take on through the SPM model to the points where we see SPM in combination with our base business actually lowering our overall risk profile rather than increasing it. In terms of returns, we have disclosed that over the past five years, the SPM business performance is highly accretive to both our operating margins and return on capital employed. So it should at least a crack at corresponding multiple to our core business. To realign our stated growth objects for SPM we are pursuing investments in new projects and the announcement made yesterday is in line with this strategy. Lastly, let me also point out that SPM remains a small part of what we do as a company. And that the core of Schlumberger continues to be focused on our technology leadership where there are currently a lot of exiting things happening. With that, lets open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, James.
James West: So, I'm going to skip SPM question, I’ll let somebody else go after since I'm pretty comfortable there.
Paal Kibsgaard: Very good.
James West: I know it returns accretive. What I wanted to talk about and you highlighted a lot of this in your prepared commentary is international, Brent at you closing on 60 here all market fundamentals clearly better than there were a quarter or quarter two ago, which market I know you don't want to get into numbers yet because it's budgeting season et cetera which international markets that are at basically rock bottom right now, do you see probably turning the fact that as we go into ‘18 and maybe the back half of ’18-19?
Paal Kibsgaard: Again, it's a bit difficult to say, but if we just go through the various parts of the international market, we were actually quite pleased with the activity we saw in Q3 in Europe, North Sea in particular as well as in Russia. The Gulf part of the Middle East remains also very solid. And then in addition to that you have Africa and Asia, where we saw basically flattish activity in Africa and we had some small encouraging signs of growth in Asia, while also Latin America was flattish. So, I would say going forward I still think that the markets that would lead is slightly going to be Russia, Europe with the North Sea and the Middle East, but there are some emerging positive signs I would say in Asia. While Africa and Latin America is still looking flattish as of now. So, early to say, but for all markets I think we are at bottom and the encouraging signs as I mentioned in the prepaid remarks is that the number of FIDs overall this year is up by about 50%.
James West: Right.
Paal Kibsgaard: Lag on activity, but it's a positive sign as well as our tendering activity, which is also up in total contract value this year by over 50%. So, there are really encouraging signs to be seen.
James West: Okay, great. And then as we think about those markets that are now starting to show signs of life or will show signs of life here shortly is the pricing environment starting to finally stabilize out?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I mean as always every contract bid any part of the world is competitive. And there is still pricing pressure and pricing challenges for all the new contracts we bid, but I would say the downward trend of pricing is slowing significantly, which I think is in line with the fact that we see activity having bottomed and is probably starting to head in the opposite direction. So, pricing headwinds at this stage is not a huge issue for us in the international market.
James West: Great. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, James.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead. 
Angie Sedita: Thanks, good morning guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Angie Sedita: So, maybe we could start with a lob for you and further a softball, thoughts on Q4, your comfort maybe around consensus or anything you talked about at a high level on the revenue or margin side?
Paal Kibsgaard: Right, so, for the Q4 outlook, we generally expect the continuation of the underline trends that we’ve seen in the third quarter, moderated somewhat by seasonality. In North America land, we do expect to grow but I think the growth rate will slow, partly due to the flattening rig count, partly due to the fact that we have deployed most of our frac equipments and also the pending holiday season. So, I would say that some growth in North America land, but obviously not the same rate as what we've seen in previous quarters. And the international market we expect some modest growth in both EMEA and Latin America, but due to the winter seasonality likely a decline in ECA. I think also year-end sales this year will be low there is no real indication of anything significant. So if you look at the Q4 consensus as it stands today, it is potentially on the high end, but I think is a good target to work towards.
Angie Sedita: Okay, appreciate that that is very helpful. And then great to hear the positive sentiment around the international outlook, clearly your tone has changed and you're seeing has changed, but maybe just to hear quickly on Ecuador and Shushufindi with the restructuring of the tariff the thoughts on what the impact could be going into 2018?
Paal Kibsgaard: Patrick do you want to handle that?
Patrick Schorn: Yes, so clearly we are very pleased that are in a more positive situation around the whole payment issue in Ecuador that has been largely resolved. Activity wise we expect to be fully focused again on maximizing production. And it is correct that we have had a change in the tariff, but it continues to be one of the heartlands of SPM that we have and where we have a business that we're very pleased. So we continue to have all the technical resources focused on improving the production levels as much as we can and where we're quite pleased with the opportunity that we have both the renegotiations in Ecuador. 
Angie Sedita: Okay, great. Thanks guys, I'll turn it over. 
Patrick Schorn: Thank you, Angie. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Ole Slorer: Yes, thanks a lot. I have two questions for you Paal, one is around Borr Drilling and the change in contracting model there. And the second one is the similar question on Cameron. But starting with Borr and in context of your comments that you are now seeing an increasing number of customers that are seeking performance, some kind of performance based contracting model that sort of breaks a little bit with the history of procurement and couple that with your view that this is sort of 50% increase in bid value.  Could you talk a little bit first maybe about how the reception has been from the drilling side of proposing performance based contracts? Is this something which is something that one or two your customers are now interested in or is it broader?
Paal Kibsgaard: Obviously performance based drilling contracts has been established on lands quite a long time. And we see that the next I would say area that this will start growing is in shallow water. If you want to drill performance based, you need to have a pretty good handle on the subsurface and the drilling rigs. And given the drilling activity that you had historically on shallow water, this is again why we see this as the next horizon that these contracts will take on. So in terms of customers, we have a range of customers who are already pursuing performance drilling contracts offshore on shallow water. The main thing is that these contracts traditionally has not included the rig. So what we're seeing now is several customers are trying to bring the rig into play. And our rationale for investing in Borr is generally to get closer to one of the rig providers to try to drive this new behavior and establish performance contracts including the rig. Now our relationship with Borr does not preclude us from having similar relationships with all the other jackup providers. And we have engagement and discussions with several of them to do exactly the same there. So I would say it's a growing interest from the customer base. We have a several key customers who are already well advanced in trying to establish this and the main thing is that we need the rational drilling company and all the other well construction related services on the rig together with the rig provider to come together and establish a contracting framework that is benefitting all parties involved. And I think that's what we are trying to drive to our initial investment in Borr.
Ole Slorer: And it does break with the traditional way of contracting, so very much so, so I was just kind of looking for to what extent customers are really opening up to that type of debate.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I think it’s fair to say that several key customers, I think are happy to never see rig day rates again, if they can get the entire drilling package, including down hole and surface on to performance based, I think that would be a benefit both for the customer and for the service companies involved.
Ole Slorer: Second question on Cameron, I mean, I think it’s clear to everybody now that when you bought Cameron back few years ago, a lot of eyebrows got raised, and looking at the results now it’s clearly something that if you believe that, I think, Cameron could’ve achieved on their own. So, you highlighted CAMShale as one of success, can you talk a little bit about other areas where give us some examples of areas where Cameron is now achieving a performance that they wouldn’t have not been able to do on their own.  I presume there are international markets that you’ve opened up for valve for that type of thing on the subsea side where you continue to crank pretty hefty margins, we hearing about pricing pressure, but sometimes it’s a little bit difficult to understand the difference between the pricing pressure and the lower cost solution. So, could you give us a few more data points around what you’ve done with Cameron? And how far you’ve come relative to what you had hoped for?
Paal Kibsgaard: First of all, Cameron was always a well-run company. And I think, what we’ve done is, we’ve brought in to our overall global organization and manage to take a well-run company, and together with what we can offer on this make one plus one equals three, that’s the whole idea behind it. So, if you look at the various product lines of Cameron, obviously OneSubsea we have been involved with for a number of years already, and the momentum of that part of the business was already quite strong, when we took full ownership of Cameron. I think you’ve seen in terms of tender win rates and the margin performance that the whole thesis behind what we try to achieve with OneSubsea is really working. On the drilling side, it’s obviously a significant lull in the market, where Cameron drilling which was to a fair extent focused on the offshore market has seen a significant reduction in activity, but they’ve done I’d say an outstanding job in redirecting the portfolio and the capability set towards supporting our rig of the future efforts. And they’re in the process of finalizing all the surface rig equipment packages as well as being more focused on the BOP side for land rigs as well. So I think we’re really working very well together with the Cameron drilling side and rig of the future project to drive performance there. On the surface side, obviously the closer tied to our frac business, where we’ve ramped up significantly in U.S. land over the past couple of quarters is a very good synergy and benefit. And I would say on surface international, there are some core very good markets for surface in the international market, but at the same time, there are number of countries and huge markets for the rest of Schlumberger, where there is very limited presence of surface and we’re obviously attacking these as we speak. And finally on valves and measurement as well, very good, I would say synergies and performance up towards what we’re doing with the early production facilities and Cameron processing overall. So, I think, all of the product lines are performing very well. I’m very pleased with the management capabilities of Cameron and also how they are very seamlessly integrating with the rest of the organization.
Ole Slorer: Congrats on that both. I hand it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Ole.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citi. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: Paal wanted to ask another question on SPM, with the growing book of business in North America, how critical are these projects to not only diversify the portfolio, but also showcase the various technologies and techniques that you can bring to the table to enhance production. During the prepared remarks Patrick mentioned the impressive results in the Powder River, are you at the point now where you can start the market results to other customers outside of the SPM initiative?
Paal Kibsgaard: To answer the last part of the question first, yes, within what is agreed with our customers, we can use this to market it. Again that’s partly the background for Patrick’s comments today and we’re quite pleased with the performance of the project and the collaboration we have with SM Energy. So I would say that looking at the North America market SPM has an opportunity set in North America for sure. And I think both SM Energy and the talks are clear examples of that. Now the benefits we have in the North America land markets that we might not see in other land based fairly commoditized market is that scale really matters. So while we obviously we will look at SPM opportunities in North America getting scale behind our activities whether this is on frocking or drilling is also something that will help us perform better in these markets. But we are pursuing SPM in the North America land market as we indicated in our conference call in July.
Scott Gruber: But do you think the production enhancement benefits that you're delivering in the Powder River and hopefully in Canada. Do you think that can drive the broader sales effort in North America around your technologies and capabilities?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes absolutely, because I think what we are doing in these projects we can provide to other companies whether that is all the way from standalone products and services, consulting services, it could be also integrate and drilling services all the way up to SPM. So the main thing is the methodology and the principles of how we go about developing these reservoirs. And we are happy to engage with our entire customer base in the range of business models that we offer. 
Scott Gruber: And how quickly do you think that that benefit can materialize? I ask because I often hear investors comment that the E&Ps particularly the larger E&Ps go around to the energy conferences and actually discuss how they're less reliant upon big service companies to execute in the shale plays. But if you can go out on these SPM projects and really showcase production enhancement it would seem a strong counter to this narrative.
Paal Kibsgaard: No that's fair. But I mean we are there to serve our customers. And if customers belief that they can do a better job without us then we will obviously try to engage with them and ensure them what we can do, but if their conclusion is that they can do it in a different way than we don't want to have an argument about that. I think there are plenty of customers who are open to kind of listen to what we do.  Some of them might be doing similar things already, in which case they may not need us. But I think there is a still a significant part of the customer base in North America land where we can have an impact. And that's what we pursuing.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And just a quick question on U.S. frac, the impressive growth during the quarter was that primarily just riding the growth plans with customers. Would you feel like you are often displacing less efficient frac companies that maybe experiencing some execution issues given the growth in the frac count?
Paal Kibsgaard: Generally this quarter we have just continue to deploy along the frac calendar that we've already had established. Now there is as you continue to push pricing and as you know some companies perform better or worse, there is always a flux around what service company works for what customer. But generally we have been executing and implementing the targeted deployment plans that we already had established. So there hasn't been a huge move around replacing others as of this stage.
Scott Gruber: Got it, I'll turn it back. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Scott. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Waqar Syed : Thank you for taking my question. My question relates to the Weatherford deal, could you appraise us of what the timing is on that deal and I understand there is a true up component as well. And could you comment in which direction the valuation could move on that deal?
Paal Kibsgaard: I won't be able to go into the details of that other than the first priority that we have been working on is to obtain the U.S. Antitrust approval. And we work closely with the DOJ to get all the information to them that they require to make their decision. And we are optimistic that we will get the U.S. Antitrust approval during the fourth quarter. And as you mentioned, there are some ancillary agreements that we still need to work through with Weatherford. These agreements were all identified and laid out as we initially sign the deal. And we hope to be in a position to finalize these discussions and basically get all the agreements done by the end of the year. So going into any details of what those agreements cover and what we're discussing, obviously I won’t be able to do that.
Waqar Syed : Okay. And then just question on SPM investments in ‘18 based on the projects that you’ve already announced, what level of SPM investments do you expect in ‘18?
Paal Kibsgaard: Patrick.
Patrick Schorn: I mean obviously there is number of deals that we have announced depending on which particular project you look at whether there is production are not obviously the investment profile and whether or not that is generating cash from day one is quite different. Overall it is a business that we see growing and therefore we intend to continue to invest in it. So you should see a -- still an increase in SPM spending and it's all going to be a question of how many deals we do. I think that is important to keep in mind that we've obviously seen quite a few SPM deals continue in the last few quarters, it is unrealistic to believe that we are going to keep at this very high rate of deals continuously going forward, it is not necessary.  So, what you will see as well is that as time progresses more and more of the projects are actually going to be generating their own cash flow. So, that is really the way that we see it going forward, it is a growing business and we'll continue to invest, it really depends a little bit on what is the total makeup of projects that we have finally in ‘18 and we're still working on doing a few more before this year is over.
Waqar Syed : So normally the run rate is around $150 million investments on a quarterly basis I guess that's the base level. So if for next year based on announcement should we assume more or like a $250 million kind of per quarter level, would that be reasonable?
Patrick Schorn: I think it is reasonable to expect that it is going to be somewhat higher. I don't want to give you a number right now.
Waqar Syed : Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead. 
Bill Herbert: Thanks, good morning. So another question on SPM, could you talk about Patrick the mix of business going for the mix of investments, the mix of projects that you expect to invest going forward on SPM?
Patrick Schorn: Yes, so there is wide variety of things that we look at when we are taking SPM projects on. It is clear that we have had traditionally a fairly strong concentration in Latin America, which we wanted to make sure that we get a more global coverage, more in line with the overall footprint that we ask and where we see the opportunities. I think it is very clear that the way we invest in SPM is also related to where we have the strong footprint and where we have some excess capacity. Because one of the key things that we do in most of the projects that we take on is that we are investing in kind, meaning we are using our services to invest and get -- and earn a certain equity in the project. The bigger of a footprint that we have in a certain place the better we can use that to at a very efficient rate invest through our own services. So going forward, you should see us to more of a coverage of SPM projects around the world that is in line with our overall footprint and where we have largest Schlumberger operations, it is likely to have SPM opportunities as well. Now, going back to how we always have described SPM opportunities, it is the field that we are looking at where we are having an opportunity to do something different than what the current customer or owner of that field is doing. So, there is got to be a technical angle in which we see that we can improve what is currently being done. And we see opportunities today in just about every area, we see them in the Far East, we see them in the Middle East, we see them in North America. So, there is plenty opportunities at this moment and I would say think about more of geographical match where the Schlumberger footprint see us go a bit more into gas and I think that is probably the best way of describing it.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And then with respect to just staying on the SPM theme, again an improving kind of macro outlook and firming oil prices, that should lead to less of a need on the part of resource holders and less of a need on the part of Schlumberger given the fact that your asset employment for your global franchise should be improving, is that correct or no?
Patrick Schorn: That's correct.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And then finally, you mentioned it in your upfront commentary Patrick that there was a lot of noise around Shushufindi and a lot of miss information, can you give us the magnitude of adjustment on the fee per barrel with regard to this project?
Patrick Schorn: So clearly, as I’ve described that we’re continue to be very happy with what we have and I think that maybe the most important to take out of the commentary and how we describe the impact is that the tariff that we’re having on Shushufindi still fully makes the returns and margin that we expect from an SPM project. So, that is probably as close as I want to get in giving you a bit color around the reduction that we have seen there. It is a project that we’re pleased with and it fits very well within our portfolio.
Bill Herbert: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jim Wicklund: Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Paal, you were talking on Ole’s question about performance based drilling and you do it now, but you haven’t done it with the rig. Can you update us on Eurasia, because if I remember correctly one of the points of owning Eurasia was the prime contract on a lot of Russian situations as the rig owner rather than in the U.S. it’s driven by completion, is that the case, is this a continuation of the trend and can you fetch us up where you’re in Eurasia?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes the rationale behind the EDC transaction is exactly as we said or described it for Borr, this obviously happens to be on land in western sub-areas as oppose to shallow water, but it’s exactly the same thing. It’s about driving drilling performance through our down hole drilling technology through the rig technology, but also through the entire one drill system including DELFI as I described earlier in the prepared remarks. So, the rationale is exactly the same. In terms of where we stand, we’re currently working through the requirements from the various Russian regulatory authorities, providing them with the information that they need to assess the application that we have to get antitrust approval. And I think the process there is moving along. We remain optimistic that we will get the ultimate approval, but our job at this stage is to provide the authorities with information that they need so that they can make their determination and their final decision. But, we remain optimistic that we will get this closed.
Jim Wicklund: Okay. My follow-up, if I could, we’ve been asked this by a couple of investors, does the latest Canadian SPM investment in terms of what you’ve done and what you’re talking about doing, does that diminish the likelihood or magnitude of buybacks or dividend increases going forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I will say on the way we’ve always planned to use our cash, the priority is always being to reinvest into the business, into projects and activities that are driving earnings and that are accretive to our returns. Beyond that, we’ve said that we’ll review dividends on an annual basis, and the balancing factor will always be buybacks. Nothing has changed to this effect. And we’ll review dividends in January and we’ll continue to be in the market to buy back stock, but we won’t buy back stock at the expense of not being able to do what we think is right, in terms of driving the growth of the underlying business.
Jim Wicklund: Perfect. Thanks guys.
Simon Ayat: Let me add one thing about the Canadian project. The maximum cash exposure that we’ve announced, which you see the basically the amount we’re going to pay upon it is a maximum cash exposure, any future investment in the project will be mitigated by the cash flow that we will generate from the production of the projects itself. So, just to make it clear, the future investment in Torxen will be basically self-sufficient from the production that we’re going to generate from the project itself.
Jim Wicklund: Okay, thanks guys it’s helpful.
Paal Kibsgaard:  Thank you, Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Kurt Hallead: Question I had for you guys, you referenced the 50% increase in FIDs and tenders, so I think that’s both in terms of number and then you mentioned contract value. I was wonder if you could give us some general size of that potential contract value and how you might assess your win rate on that contract value?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I don’t want to go into what the exact volume is in terms of contract value, but if you look at our win rates, obviously all of these contracts are highly competitive, but I’d say that I’m at this stage satisfied with our win rate. Our win rate in 2017 is somewhat up from what it was in 2016, it continues to be competitive. But we’re looking to balance out the pricing that we put into these contracts, which we will need to leverage for a number of years. At the same time having I would say the contract base and the growth platform we require to be in an optimal position as the international upturn starts. So, overall we’re spending a lot of time making sure that we treat every tendering opportunity with a maximum amount of attention and I think so far we’ve been quite successful in doing so.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. And then your commentary around the tenders and the FIDs, you’ve referenced both land and offshore, and then on the offshore front, you had some commentary about shallow water. I wonder if you give us some perspective on shallow water, deep water, what are you seeing between shallow and deep on the tenders and FIDs going into next year.
Paal Kibsgaard: I think it’s pretty evident that the shallow water is going to come back a lot quicker compared to I would say an overall ramp in deep water activity. So this is again partly while we have our focus on shallow water both from a Schlumberger drilling services standpoint, but also teaming up with the jackup providers like Borr to make sure that we are in the forefront of securing the work on these rigs as they start to ramp up.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. And if I may squeeze one last one in here, so your referenced Paal a hardware ownership being critical to your strategy going forward, hardware is very generic term. So I was wondering if you could elaborate little bit more on hardware is it rigs, land rigs, offshore rigs, is it just equipment. So, just wondered if you could elaborate little bit more on that hardware element?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I agree hardware is a pretty generic term, but I would say that the current ownership that we have of hardware, I’m pretty happy with it. So, we are not going in to take full ownership of jackup rigs or floaters, we are taking ownership of our own internally developed land rigs. But beyond that we want to have relationships with jackup providers and potentially floater providers. But our focus now is on the jackups, and we have no intentions what so ever of going back into full ownership of offshore rigs.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, great, excellent. Thank you so much, appreciate it.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question today comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, first question, could you talk about the production margins in 3Q and the negative impact that you saw from the reactivations. Sounds like that some of that kind of comes out in 4Q, but maybe if you could kind of help us frame that a little bit.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, the production -- I mean, if you look at what is reported the main impact on the incremental margins sequentially for the production group is what we refer to North America land, where we have had a pretty significant ramp up, both in the second and the third quarter. And this creates inefficiencies internally in terms of how we deploy, how we hire and also how we optimize our distribution network for all the products that we need to get into these operations as well. So, some bottlenecks were experienced in the third quarter, and we are basically working through this now and they should generally abate in the fourth quarter and for sure into the first quarter. So, we’re working through these things and I’m not overly worried about it, but there are some things to be sorted out, which we are actively working on as we speak.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, thank you, Paal. One quick follow-up, I’m just kind of following up on Bill and Scott’s question around SPM, when we think about SPM kind of an U.S. onshore, are you trying to take advantage of excess service capacity or is it more about kind of better of penetration of technology. And if it’s the latter, what technologies do you think you’re able to exploit through SPM that are not through your traditional businesses?
Paal Kibsgaard: I would say in U.S. land it’s generally looking to basically demonstrate what our technology and capability set can generate. So, this is all the way from well placement, drilling efficiency, frac placement and also overall how we complete these wells. So, it's most of these things we have generally talked to all our customers about already.  The main thing is the ability to put this together into consistently delivering top quartile wells, which I think we’ve demonstrated through the example that Patrick descried today with SM Energy. So we’re just looking to be more of that and that could be in the form of SPM, but like I said earlier to be in any form of whatever contractual engagement our customers are looking for.
Chase Mulvehill: Great. Thank you, I'll turn it back over, thanks Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: All right, thank you very much. So, as usual I would like to close with a summary of the major points that we have discussed this morning. First, we have overall past few years created industry’s broadest upstream technology portfolio. Through the Cameron transaction a series of acquisitions, joint venture and partnerships with smaller technology companies and our own research and development efforts we have created an unparalleled technology platform, which is now ready for broad based system integration. Second, our long held views on the oil market are now being reinforced by data points that make us increasingly positive on the outlook and recovery for our global business. And last as the global E&P investments start to recover Schlumberger is uniquely positioned to outperform based on the strength of our technology portfolio, the capabilities of our global organization and the quality and the efficiency of the services we provide to our customers. That concludes our call for today. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-07-21 08:30:00) =====

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Thank you. Hello, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2017 results conference call. Today’s call is being hosted from Paris, France, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice-President New Ventures. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we will open up for questions. By way of an agenda, Simon Ayat will first present comments on our second quarter financial performance before Patrick Schorn reviews our results by geography, which may include a discussion on Schlumberger production management. Paul will close our remarks with an updated yield of the industry macro. However, before we begin I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we’ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.35. This represents an increase of $0.10 sequentially and $0.12 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the current quarter, we recorded $0.40 of charges. This primarily relates to Cameron merger and integration charges as well as a financing agreement we entered into with our primary customer in Venezuela. We received an interest bearing promissory note in exchange of $700 million of receivables. The accounting rules required us to record this note as its estimated fair value on the date of the exchange which resulted in a charge. Our second quarter revenue of $7.5 billion increased 8% sequentially, largely driven by the production group as a result of strong pressure pumping activity in North America land. Pretax operating margin only increased 175 basis points to 12.7%. Highlights by product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.8 billion increased 9% sequentially, primarily due to higher international activities across its product lines beyond the seasonal rebounds in Russia and Caspian and the North Sea region. Margins of 17% were essentially flat. Drilling Group revenue of $2.1 billion increased 6% sequentially, while margin increased 278 basis points to 14.3%. These increases were driven by strong directional drilling activity in U.S. land combined with the seasonal increases internationally. Production Group revenue of $2.5 billion increased 14% sequentially, while margin expanded by 382 basis points to 8.9%. These results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity and the pricing recovery in North America land. The Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was largely driven by higher sales in surface systems across all areas and increased valve and measurement activity in North America. Margins increased 61 basis points to 13.8% as OneSubsea margins exceeded 20% for the fourth straight quarter as a result of strong project execution. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle businesses increased to 1.1 in the first quarter. This marks the first time these businesses have been above 1 since the fourth quarter of 2013. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle businesses decreased to 0.8 in the Q2. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 18.9% in the second quarter compared to 15.3% in the previous quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the increased earnings in North America. The ETR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. We expect the ETR will increase next quarter as North America continues to represent an increasing proportion of our earnings. In the second quarter, we generated $858 million of cash flow from operations. Working capital consumes approximately $550 million of cash during the quarter partially reflecting the growth in activity in addition to increased investments in preparation for the growth. Working capital also reflected the payment of $90 million in severance during the quarter. We remained very confident in our ability to deliver on our free cash flow target for the year during -- driven by a very strong performance in the second half of the year. Our net debt increased $1.2 billion during the quarter to $12.6 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $6.2 billion. During the quarter, we spend $398 million to repurchase 5.5 million shares at an average price of $72.34. We started off the second quarter with a higher rate of shared repurchases but reduces considerably as we progress on the EDC discussions, which will be 100% cash transactions. Paul will comment further on the EDC transaction. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $500 million on CapEx and the investments of approximately $180 million in SPM projects. During the quarter, we also made $697 million of dividend payments. Full year 2017 CapEx, excluding SPM and multiclient investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.2 billion. And now I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.
Patrick Schorn: Thank you, Simon. Looking at activity geographically we had a very strong quarter in North America with revenue growing 18% sequentially driven by increased activity from the unconventional basis in U.S. lands. Rapid deployment of our ideal hydraulic fracturing capacity and continued growth in our drilling related product lines all contributed to a 42% sequential revenue growth in U.S. lands. Hydraulic fracturing revenue increased by 68% sequentially significantly outperforming the 23% increase in the land rig count. We remain sold out for several of our key directional technologies as our customers continue to move towards more complex well profiles with longer laterals. Despite the significant costs associated with reactivating equipment and infrastructure as well as adding people all of our U.S. product lines were profitable in the second quarter. This was driven by increases in products and service pricing, improved operational efficiency, proactive supply chain management and the growing impact of our vertical integration investments around sand production and distribution. Cameron also contributes to our strong financial performance with higher product sales in wells and measurements and increased activity for our service systems product line. While we saw sequential revenue reductions from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and seasonally in Western Canada. Looking forward, we expect U.S. land activity to remain strong throughout the second half of the year with our frac calendar already fully booked well into Q4 and the high demand of our drilling services expected to continue. We are also on track to complete the OneStim joint venture during the second half of the year which will provide us with additional hydraulic horse power capacity as well as a full suite of multi stage completion technology. Internationally revenue increased 4% sequentially driven by growth in all geographical areas. In most geo markets, growth went well beyond the seasonal recovery from the winter slowdown. Europe’s CIS and Africa revenue increased 6% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the Russia and CIS region where we saw the start of the summer drilling campaigns in Sakhalin together with continued strong activity in Western Siberia. North Sea activity was strong in both the U.K. and Norway as rig count increased and summer exploration work began. While the rig count stabilized in Sub Sahara and Africa as activity started to recover on land and with early signs of customers preparing to resume activity on key offshore projects. Revenue in Latin American increased 9% sequentially driven by solid activity and sales in Mexico and increased exploration and development work in Columbia. Argentina revenue was also higher on increased unconventional land development while activity in Brazil and Venezuela remained weak. Ecuador revenue was also somewhat lower sequentially however with the cooperation of Petroamazonas, Shushufindi production has now turned around and started to recover towards the end of the quarter. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue increased 1% sequentially as activity in Egypt, Iraq and the UAE remained solid. We also saw seasonal rebounce in activity in China driven by higher sales of completion products and services as well as our SPM gas project in the [Indiscernible] fields, while drilling activity and product sales also grew in Vietnam and Thailand. Next, I would like to provide an update on our SPM business and the rational behind their ongoing investment program. Today, most of the work we undertake for our customers continues to be contracted as individual products and services, and we do not see this changing in the foreseeable future. However, building on our broad technology offering and deep domain expertise, we have overtime also established significant project management and integration capabilities which we offer to our customers through more collaborative and commercially aligned business models. The SPM business model represents the ultimate alignment with our customers as we take on full field management of their assets risking the value of our product and services and sometimes cash and where we get paid a share of the value we generate from incremental production. Our first SPM project started in 2004 after which we have gradually expanded this business to each day we manage 15 projects in 7 countries. In 2016, our SPM business generated $1.4 billion in revenue and has over the period from 2011 to 2016 delivered return on capital employed which is around 700 basis points higher than the rest of our business. The SPM business therefore represents the highest multiple we can get on our technical capabilities and in addition these long term projects have provided a welcome full cycle baseline of activity, revenue and returns. Over the past three years we have seen a surge in SPM opportunities from both existing and new customers which we have decided to proactively pursue. This is by no means a desire to change the face of our company which will continue to be focused on market leadership in each individual product line, but instead SPM can create a baseline of activity to support our presence in the different geographies. We remain confident that despite our drive to expand our SPM business which has a different contract structure compared to our traditional business we are not significantly changing the risk profile of the company. That is because the biggest risk we continue to face as an oil field products and services company remains the cyclical nature of our industry. The SPM business although different in nature and contractual structure will in fact help dampen the impact of these cycles, provided the projects we invest in at the necessary full cycle robustness which of course remains a key selection criterion in all our evaluations. Through our ongoing investment program we expect to double SPM revenue over the next two years and overtime make SPM equivalent in size to one of our existing four groups. In terms of financials we have made a total capital investment of $4.3 billion in SPM projects since 2012 which represents less than 10% of our cash flow from operations over the same period. Our SPM investments are currently being amortized at an annual rate of approximately $450 million and the amortization schedules are periodically reviewed and adjusted to match project life and economics. The current investment in SPM projects on our balance sheet is $2.6 billion. In the last 12 months we have announced future multiyear investment plans of $390 million with YPF in Argentina and $700 million with FIRST E&P and NNPC in Nigeria. In addition, we have started off smaller projects with SM Energy in the Powder River Basin in the U.S. and with [Indiscernible] in Western Canada. Going forward, we will through a newly established venture funds look to access an increasing amount of external funding for our SPM business through the refinancing of existing projects where today we carry 100% of the project funding and by inviting financial investors to take a share in our upcoming projects. So in summary, our SPM investment program is focused on establishing a full cycle activity revenue and financial base line in many of the countries we operate in as well as on continuously providing accretive returns when compared to our base business. I will now turn the call back over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Patrick. So next let’s turn to the oil market where a sustained growth and demand continues to provide a much needed foundation for the outlook leaving little reason for concern over this part of the oil market equation. The supply side however is far more complex with market nervousness and investors speculation generally overshadowing facts and physical fundamentals leading to unpredictable movement in oil prices inspite of a third year of global under investment. The status of the global oil supply is best described by splitting the production base into three main block. First, Russia and the OPEC Gulf countries, second U.S. lands and third the rest of the world. The OPEC Gulf countries and Russia which combine make or close to 40% of global oil production remain fully committed to sound and consistent stewardship of their resource base. This is reflected in a steady increase in oil selectivity over the past three years as the world’s best well at economics easily absorbed the significant drop in oil prices. These countries are also actively supporting the rebalancing of the global oil market by taking a procative role in moderating the current production levels. The other two blocks of supply are currently pursuing diametrically post directions to both investments and resource management driven by the respective stakeholders. The production level from the U.S. land E&P companies which currently represent around 8% of global oil supply is largely driven by the U.S. equity investors who are encouraging, enabling and rewarding short term production growth inspite of marginal project economics. The fast barrels from U.S. land are facilitated by a factory approach to both drilling and production and supported by a rapidly scalable supplier industry with a low barrier to entry. In this market the pursuit of equity appreciation outweighs the lack of free cash flow, net income and return on capital employed for both E&P companies and the service industry. And although the fast barrels from U.S. land have already cooled the oil price sentiments as well as the evaluation of the equity investments themselves, this has yet to limit the investment appetite for additional production growth. The last book of producers making up the rest of the world today represents over 50% of global oil production and covers a broad and diverse group of IOCs, NOCs, and independent operators. In aggregate, this group is for the third successive year highly focussed on meeting the cash return expectations of their shareholders whether these are equity investors or governance. The operators meet these requirements by striving to keep production flat by producing their existing outlets part of their normal and by limiting investments to what provides short term contributions to production at the expense of increasing deflection rates. These producers have also benefited from a production tailwind of 500,000 barrels to 700,000 barrels per day in each of the past three years coming from new projects where the majority of the investments were made in previous years. And with a low rate of new projects being sanctioned since 2014 this tailwind will taper off in the coming years. This harvesting approach is not uncommon for conventional oilfields that are in their last years of life prior to being shut in. However, this investment in stewardship model is sustainable for a vast resource space that is both expected and required to provide a substantial part of global oil production for decades to come. Needless to say, the longer the current under investment carries on, the more severe the cliff like decline trend will likely be when the producers run out of short term options to maintain production. And given the size of the production base, it would be difficult for the rest of the global producers to compensate for this pending supply challenge. So, how does this supply and demand situation translate into the current status of the oil market? Following the extension of the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts agreed in late May, the oil markets and also included, we are expecting to see clear reductions in global inventory levels in the second quarter leading to a more positive sentiments in the oil market. Instead, oil prices and market sentiments became unexpectedly more negative driven largely by fear of oversupply from the growing production from U.S. land where investments and activity is booming. This increasingly negative sentiment is reflected in the oil markets interpretation of the latest industry data points. First the fact that oil to the inventories are coming down so much slower than expected is currently a major concern for the market, although inventories are still coming down and the drills are expected to accelerate in the second half of this year. And second, the fact that production from Libya and Nigeria has increased in recent months it is also a major concern for the market even though these countries were excluded from the production cuts because their production levels were low at the time of the agreement. What we are currently witnessing is that the U.S. equity investors and E&P companies have spooked the oil market investors into believing that the fast barrels from U.S. land will flood the markets and leave inventory levels elevated for the foreseeable future. Therefore their pursuit of short term equity returns from the U.S. land E&P stocks is actually preventing the recovery of the oil market and sending oil prices further down thereby eliminating any equity appreciation that the investments set out to create in the first place. So what does this mean for the outlook for oil prices and E&P investments? The latest developments in the oil markets has created more uncertainty around the shape and timing of the global industry recovery. However, the near to medium term market evolution will continue to be dictated by the following three factors. First, with the moderation and the investment appetite towards the fast but marginal barrels from U.S. land leading to a stronger focus on E&P financial returns and the need to operate within free cash flow. Second, with the key OPEC and non-OPEC countries extends the production cuts beyond the current nine month agreement. And third, with the emerging trend of a gradual investment increase in the rest of the world accelerate, develop mitigate or at least dampen the pending medium-term supply challenges. These three factors are somewhat interdependent and forecasting the forward part from the current market situation is at present difficult given the unpredictable and at times irrational behavior of the broader oil market. Still it remains clear to us that the current underinvestment in the rest of the world with increasing certainty create a mounting supply challenge over the coming years which will require a significant increase and acceleration in global E&P spend. At present we are seeing the first small signs of increasing investments in the rest of the world. However, the further evolution of this emerging trend will still be governed by the actions of the OPEC Gulf countries and Russia on one side and the U.S. equity investors and E&P companies on the other. New fund moderation from the U.S. producers combined with continued moderation from the OPEC Gulf countries and Russia should pave the way for a steady increase in oil prices. This in turn will provide an investment platform that will allow all three supplier groups to increase E&P spend to jointly help mitigate the pending supply issues. On the other hand, an absence of moderation from both sides could lead to further drop in oil prices which in turn would both accelerate and amplify the pending supply issues. In this market we continue to focus on serving our customers and driving on business forward by broadening our technology portfolio and increasing our addressable market by further streamlining our execution machine and by pursuing new and more collaborative ways of working with our customers. And in doing so we are maintaining a balanced coverage of the global oil and gas industry allowing us to effectively address current and future customer activity. This includes U.S. land where we today are seeing strong growth in both activity and service pricing. The OPEC Gulf countries and Russia already continue to see strong activity and a broad uptake of our entire technology offering, as well as the rest of the world which in spite of record low activity levels still represent over 50% of global oil production and we’ll at some stage need to return to considerably higher investment levels even to just uphold current production. As part of our global focus we yesterday announced our intention to acquire a majority stake in the Eurasia drilling company in Russia. This extents the success for long-term relationship we have enjoyed with EDC through this strategic alliance we sign in 2011 which has enabled the deployment of a broad range of our drilling and well engineering services to our customers in Russia land. The pending EDC transaction together with our recent investment in a land rig manufacturing facility in Kaliningrad will further broaden our present infrastructure and capabilities used to serve the conventional Russian land drilling market. In Western Siberia, the land drilling contractors continue to have the leading role in providing integrated drilling services through turnkey models. And as the uptake of horizontal drilling continues to increase the deployment of integrated drilling systems through the EDC platform including our rig of the future, will allow us to bring new levels of drilling efficiency to our existing and new customers in this large market. So we are pleased to have reached this agreement with the EDC shareholders and we are already well advanced in preparing the regulatory filings required to complete this transaction. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, James.
James West: So, thanks for the bit of your macro thoughts here. I wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on those macro thoughts in the oil markets. We’ve seen a tremendous slowdown in equity issuance from the E&P industry in the U.S. which I know has been kind of a thorn in the side, if you will, of the oil markets and then of course you're talking somewhat about pick up internationally that coming somewhat sooner than we would have expected. How does this all play out? Do you think that investors as you talk to investors and certainly as you look at the market do you think that the whole, I guess, forgive the phrase shale game of share has kind of played out here in North America, the markets kind of picking up on the fact, there is no cash flow. Or do you – are you concern that this game continues for a while and so we’ll kind of stuck in the mud?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think we talked about this before and this – the overall set up of the U.S. shale business where there hasn’t been positive cash flow or positive free cash flow for what the – the last six, seven years. We have comment on that as that’s being a bit of a surprise already. Now whether it will continue or not, I think its going to come down to two things, whether they can still continue to borrow going into 2018 and whether they continue to hedge. So I think today they still operate beyond cash flow, but I think the situation for the rest of the year is relatively set. So we expect to see steady increase in activity both in Q3 and Q4. What will happen in 2018? I think is a bit early to say. But as of now I think its still likely that we will continue to see strong activity in the U.S. in 2018 whether it will have the same type of growth rate we’ve seen in 2017, that might not be the case.
James West: Right. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks Paal. And then with respect to the lower 48 especially given that we’re recycling cash at these kind of oil prices and the well costs are continuing to move higher both as you and others raise pricing back to much more acceptable levels, although I know you probably still think they're not quite acceptable but they at least go in the right direction here. Where do you guys shakeout in terms of actual well costs where you can actually for an oil price basis make money in the U.S. market?
Paal Kibsgaard: From our standpoint, or from the E&P?
James West: E&Ps.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, it’s difficult for me to say that. I mean you see a range of so call breakeven costs where some of the transportation premiums, the discounts to the WTI standard, the amortization of the infrastructure and land is not included. So, it is very difficult for me to say, but if you go back and look at both cash flow and profitability for most of the E&Ps in Q1 where the situation actually was quite favorable. There was limited pricing faction from the service industry and the commodity price were still high than what it is today. I think they were probably few of them even at that stage that really generated a profit. So, it's difficult for me to say. From our standpoint like we commented on in the prepared remarks, we are now profitable in all product lines. And we see continued growth in activity going forward in the next couple of quarters. So at least our business is back in the back and we are now obviously actively pursuing market share.
James West: Okay, good. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, James.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer: Thank you very much. And thanks for shedding some light, Patrick on the SPM model. You said doubling this business over the next a couple years, does it mean that you’ll double the $2.5 billion or $2.6 billion that you now have invested. And could you highlight little bit what incremental capital that would take. And also maybe – I saw in the NNPC agreement that there were some references to guarantees. And how do you go about getting guarantees when it comes to non-OECD players?
Patrick Schorn: All right. So, let me take a stab at that. So, firstly, we were talking about doubling the revenue that is what we said and clearly the longer term ambition remaining that we are growing at even further into the size what's today a group would be. The issue with these type of contractors that there is a variety of ways and how you can structure these deals and therefore the associated investments are actually quite different. It's very difficult to say that the basket of projects that we have today would be exactly the same type of basket that we have going forward and therefore the investments remain the same. What we’re doing on a continuous basis is evaluating the overall portfolio of projects that we have. Look at the risks that we are having vis-à-vis certain partners, certain countries and certain investment level. So we’ll continue to play that by year., And as you are very familiar with is that we’re not only trying to finance these deals from our own cash growth, so looking to take in partners in the deals through our venture fund going forward. So I don't think that you can straight say, the amount of capital we had invested in the past is something we would double or quadruple going forward. That is certainly not the case. It’s going to be a function of the type of projects that we take on. I think what is very clear is that the opportunity basket that we have today significantly larger than anything that we have seen in the past. Now obviously if you look at what have we learned in the years that we've done these type of projects is that there is a significant value in making sure that you are involved in the amortization of the hydrocarbon and therefore have a certain level of control when the cash returns back to where to us. And in more and more of the contracts that we have today, we are doing this through offshore escrow accounts, being very clear involved in the chain of custody of the hydrocarbon. And therefore that we know exactly when we get paid as this is sometime particularly in times of low oil price, obviously something that is more difficult. When it comes to returns and guarantees that you can get, clearly some of the projects that we have and kickstarting new business models in certain types of environments will require us to properly address risks that are potentially there. And therefore we have in certain of our contracts a guaranteed return that we would have on the investments that we make and clearly that allows us to go forward with these types of business models.
Ole Slorer: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you very much. And Paal, maybe you can tap in to some of that $100 billion of Wall Street, money that’s been pouring into the shale and when it comes to tapping your E&P events, it sounds like your returns are little better?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, that was absolutely the plan, Ole, that’s the plan.
Ole Slorer: Okay. Thank you. I’ll hand it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Ole.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning or good afternoon.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: So, speaking on SPM, James highlighted that there has been a slowdown in equity issuances by the domestic E&Ps and debt financing costs starting to creep higher, although they’re not punitive yet. But given these trends and stagnant crude prices do you think there's an emerging opportunity for SPM in North America? It sounds like you recently signed a few deals? Are there more in the queue?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. Clearly, we have mentioned some of the deals here in our earlier remarks and clearly today there is an opportunity in North America for this business model because it is also allowing us to bring the appropriate technology into the shale plays that we have won it or into the tight oil and gas and therefore there is a increasing opportunity set also in North America and for that matter I would say that today we have opportunities in just about every geography around the world.
Scott Gruber: In other words, do you think if North America could become a material percentage of the book of business if you grow SPM to be its own reportable segment?
Paal Kibsgaard: Absolutely.
Scott Gruber: I understand. If I could sneak one more in. You had significant restart cost in North America land this quarter. Are you to dimension how this falls off over 3Q and 4Q, so if we simply say that those extraordinary restart costs in 2Q were index that like one, where thus this figure head into the Q4, because its something like 0.7 and 0.3, I’m trying to think about how those extraordinary costs roll-off over time here?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So we -- if you are doing the exit on Q2 I would say that Q3 will be pretty much 1.0 as well. We will continue to deploy at almost exactly the same rate and we expect to have all our total fleets of ideal pressure pumping assets in operation by early Q4. Now after that the startup cost will start to abate. It will come down in Q4 and going into Q1. But Q3 will see the same rate of deployments and unfortunate the same rate of startup costs. But we are very pleased with the progress we’re making here and we have -- the rate of deployments that we have now in our pressure pumping business is unprecedented, we’ve never gone at this rate before.
Scott Gruber: Great. Thanks for the color. I’ll turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, you mentioned about the percolating visibility and an improved outlook for international driven by Russia and GCC, could you -- and also offshore FIDs. Could you elaborate on the nature of those projects, long cycle versus short cycle? And also interestingly reconciling, the increasing activity on the one hand on the part of Russia and GCC, but on the other hand keep in mind that they are effectively the fulcrum of the Vienna Accord. And I'm just curious as to how that tension interplays with each other?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. Well, if I first look at the overall the international market in terms of the nature of activity. What we -- first of all, what we are seeing in most of the basins around the world takeaway as we say Russia and the OPEC Gulf, we are at unprecedented lows in terms of activity. So I think it’s very natural that activity starts to come back. We were somewhat positively surprised at the rate it came back in Q2. It is not a dramatic increase. But it was more than what we were expecting from seasonality. And if you takeaway Cameron which is three, four quarters behind in the cycle compared to the legacy Schlumberger business. We grew the legacy business 10% sequentially in land, 8% in ECA and 2% in MEA. So these were numbers generally higher than what we were anticipating. So it is a combination I would say of land focus in all of the three reporting areas. But as we commented on this well, there are signs now of offshore project being prepared for FIDs and tendering, we see it in particular through OneSubsea business and a lot of this is tiebacks which basically the nature of that is going to be a lot more short cycle on the offshore business than what we’ve seen in the past. And generally on land it is all short cycle as well. So, the lion share of the activity we’re seeing internationally is short cycle, which is what you would expect where the operators are looking to minimize the time between cash outlays and production coming back.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And is there a threshold oil price when you discuss broadly speaking with your international client base that results in E&P capital spending growth or alternatively results in a continued stagnation. What’s the dividing line between growth and a standing still?
Paal Kibsgaard: We don’t discuss the details of what their -- their decision-making is based on. Other than that we are very actively work with all customers in bringing cost to barrel down, whether this is offshore or on land. And given the fact that I would say a lot of the operators have been producing their assets quite hard over the past two, three years. I think there’s a need to start replenishing reserves and also supporting production with more wells and smaller tiebacks and so forth. So, given the fact that this uptick has happened in the second quarter, but actually saw low oil prices than in the first quarter. I think this is more a general direction of the international production base. Most basins have unprecedented low activity and investment levels, and we seem to be coming off the bottom now. It will obviously supported more by higher oil prices, but there has been movement in the second quarter, which has actually seen a more negative oil price sentiment. I think that’s going to turn in the second half of the year in the terms of sentiments, but the start of growth momentum, although still nascent has happened in the second quarter.
Bill Herbert: Thank you, sir.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jim Wicklund: Good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Jim.
Jim Wicklund: Paal, I don’t disagree with you at all on the lack of return focused by the E&P industry. But onshore U.S. market is about the same size as the rest of the world added together. And so, if the E&P industry in 2018 were to live within cash flow, you’d have to drop about 300 rigs in the U.S. The transition would be a higher oil price I guess and higher activity international. How do you manage for something like that considering the ramp up you had in North America in pressure pumping just over the last six months? If that were to happen is it a smooth transition for Schlumberger and it's obviously beneficial because your bigger internationally, but with everything that's happened is there a dislocation coming if that were to happen?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, first of all, I’m not saying that that’s happening.
Jim Wicklund: Please believe me – believe me, nobody is been able to rein in the E&P industry, so...
Paal Kibsgaard: Exactly. So, I think it’s unlikely that you’ll see a major sort of tectonic movement here. But the fact that the industry in North America land continues to operate way beyond cash flow. I think that’s going to be challenged if oil prices stay where it is. So that could mean for sure that the growth rate would slow. I don't think you’ll see a significant reduction in activity, but I think the growth rate might slow. So I think there is still going to be possibilities both to land and potentially raise more equity, but in the event we continue at the current oil prices. I think the industry is going to be a bit more strain than what we have seen in 2017. Now, how we would manage that? We obviously – we are redeploying very actively our idle frac capacity. These are assets that we own already. And we are hiring people to operate them. And we are in a cyclical business. And it's a matter of adding proactively when you have the opportunity to catch growth and generate incremental. And if there is a headwind then we need to deal with it.
Jim Wicklund: Okay. And my follow-up would be -- and it just kind of occurred to me. Are we to the point yet in pressure pumping in terms of demand cost of reactivation et cetera, are we at the point in pressure pumping or Schlumberger is considering ordering new pressure pumping equipment?
Paal Kibsgaard: No. We’re not. We are very actively working on closing out OneStim JV with Weatherford with the DOJ. There has been some additional information from the DOJ which we are now providing them with. And we are obviously optimistic that we can close this during the second half of the year. And when that’s done, we will have sufficient pressure pumping and a capacity to see us through at least 2018.
Jim Wicklund: Okay. Patrick, a question on year end of the business, you say that you’re going to look for partners through the venture fund going forward. Have you already started soliciting partners for the venture fund? And what kind of partners do you want or expect to have?
Patrick Schorn: So, yes, we obviously have engaged with quite a few people in the financial world. We’re working through a few banks focus on the variety of target groups that we are trying to look at, but it's mainly banks, family, offices, pension funds that are showing quite a bit of interest of being part of this. So at this moment a lot of these discussions are taking place, but as you well know there is a tremendous amount of money available looking for the right deal to be part of.
Jim Wicklund: Okay. Thanks guys. Good quarter. Have a good day.
Patrick Schorn: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Paal, you all have given I’d said, more time to sustainability this year than we’ve seen in the past. I was just wondering if you could talk about sustainability just from a strategic standpoint and how its impacting cultures as well as potentially the way Schlumberger does business around the world?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we’ve always been I would say focused on sustainability, the impact we have on the environment around us in terms of our operation, but also the positive impact we live in the various communities that we are part of around the world. What we haven’t done up until the last couple of years is to really document this and put this together into something that we can present to governments, as well as to the investor base. And I think that’s the main focus that we’ve had now over the past few years. There’s also a certain report and certain things that we do become part of in order to get certain certifications and rankings in terms of what our efforts are. So over the past couple years we have put that together into the report, which is then available both to local communities, governments and to the investment community where we really summarize and demonstrate what is long-term commitment is all about. And we understand the importance of this for the investment community for instance around what part of the investment community are interested -- invested in the company where the focus on sustainability is obviously a key decision criteria. So we’ll see the importance of it. It's not something new that we started off. But we’re taking the effort of putting together our efforts so there are much more transparent in summary.
Michael LaMotte: And so it becomes a key competitive advantage, do you think?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I haven’t looked exactly what our competitors are doing here. What we are doing is something that we believe in and that we’ve done for a long time. And I said the main thing we've done now is to just summarize it, and whether that’s a competitive advantage or not. Maybe it is but we haven’t done it for that reason. We’ve done it because we believe in it and it's something in very worthwhile for us to do.
Michael LaMotte: Okay. And then, if I could just follow-up on the on the incremental margin question. When we have talked about 60%, 65% incrementals in the past for a country once it sort of reaches the inflection point of growth. Is there a growth rate that is really necessary to drive that kind of incrementals, I think about faster velocity driving some inflation perhaps acceleration of technology use et cetera. Is a slower growth trajectory I guess a struggle to achieve the kind of incremental margin?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think in the international markets, I would say whether – I mean -- if the growth rate there is higher, it would be -- I would say easier to generate higher incrementals. So we have a very good I think handle on the supply chain there. As we have in the U.S. as well, but the rate of inflation in the U.S. is always a lot quicker for significant activity increases. So, I would say that to get incrementals, higher growth rates would be -- would make it probably easier to do it provided that we have a good handle on the supply chain. But the key for the 65% incremental, so is that we need to have some pricing. And also those incrementals will kick in when we have kind of transitioned business from part of it basically being still in decline and battling some pricing issues. We need to firmly reach bottom in all aspects of the business and then start recovering from there including pricing. But the so far when we look at incrementals company wide for Q2 around mid-30s is I would say acceptable at this stage. I don’t it's fantastic. And it's something that we have a very strong focus on going forward. And as we start to I would say, complete the last part of the bottom of the cycle, I’ll expect that we get close to these incrementals that we had promised.
Michael LaMotte: Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: One moment please for your next question.
Paal Kibsgaard: If Kurt is not there maybe we can skip to the next one.
Operator: One moment please. Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Can you hear me? Everything is good.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. Hi, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: Okay good. Paal, given the beat quarter and a general positive commentary in the press release and what you been saying here on the call. I’m assuming that bodes well for some upside earnings revisions in the back half of the year. How do you feel about where Street numbers are right now if you look into the three quarter, fourth quarter this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at Q3 in terms of the business we expect to see continuation of the trends that we saw in the second quarter. So, for North America that means continued solid growth. We expect the rig count to continue to grow in Q3, although likely slow in somewhat in pace. We expect to see additional pricing and share gains in directional drilling and as I mentioned earlier we will continue to activate or reactivate frac capacity at the same rate as we did in Q2. Internationally, we also expecting to see a continuation of these encouraging signs we saw from Q2. We do expect single-digit sequential growth in ECA and MEA and actually most of the deal markets in these two areas will see growth we expect in Q3. But due to activity mix and some completion of projects we likely see a slight drop in Latin America in Q3. So, I would say, combining all of this I believe that the current Street consensus for Q3 is a good starting point.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. And you know I think the stock is obviously creating on what expectations are for 2018 and then probably way too early for anybody to make that assessment for sure, but some of the commentary you had in the call today, you sort of paying say a more optimistic picture than when where sentiment is you know at this juncture. So what do you think the primary risk would be overall to an improvement in 2018 versus 2017 maybe you can give us some color, also maybe some benchmarks for us to look for in the back half of the year that would either give us more confidence or flag some additional risks as we look out to 2018?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes to comment on 2018, I think like you say is still too early. In terms of where we sit at the company and I’ll comment on the overall in a second, but I think if you look at our position in North America land we have never been better positioned to capture growth both in the drilling manufacturing business. And internationally with some of the recent moves that we just announced plus the overall step out we’ve had in total addressable market we are extremely well positioned to capture growth in every corner of the world as the global investment eventually will start to increase right. So, I will say the short term risk from the trends that we are currently seeing I think would be that, that there is still I would say issues around how the markets sees inventory gross. So far in July it’s been very positive in particular in the U.S. and if this continues I think that should bode well for a gradual increase in oil prices in the second half of the year. But as a matter of how fast the U.S. producers are putting barrels on the market and also what’s going to be important is what OPEC and Russia does you know come the end of the 9 month production cut period, right. So I think there is issues around or risks around how they interplay between the U.S. producers on one side and the Russia OPEC producers on the other side, how they play this out over the next I would say year or so, we are very clear in our view that you go 2019 and 2020 we are going to have potentially significant supply challenges. So the fact that global investments will come up in that period I think is very clear. What’s going to happen in the period before we get there is going to come down to the plans of OPEC and Russia on one hand and the U.S. producers on the other.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, great. All right, that’s awesome. Appreciate the color, thanks.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Byron Pope from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.
Byron Pope: Good morning. Just had a question on SPM, so given the margin and returns accretive nature of your SPM work and the plans to double the revenue base over the next couple of years, could you just frame for us how you think about which of your three international regions in which you report revenues are likely to drive that SPM growth, I know you got projects in a number of different countries but I’m just trying to think about it in terms of your three international regions?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I am disappointed but not going straight international. But I think that some of the very large opportunities that we see here at the moment and we are working on actively at this moment are actually right in North America. Apart from those there are significant projects coming up in discussion in the Middle East that might not strike you as the first place for SPM to take place but also there we have significant opportunities and apart from that it is going to be more of Asia, more of Africa those are the key type of areas that we are looking at the moment. But I don’t think you can underestimate the impact that SPM can have on North America.
Byron Pope: That’s it from me. Thanks.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jud Bailey: Thanks, good morning. I had a follow up on OneStim if you don’t mind. Paal, you mentioned that you expected for the Schlumberger equipment to be fully utilized by the beginning of the fourth quarter. As you look into 2018, as you acknowledge there is quite bit of uncertainty as to how spending budgets progress, how do you think about deploying the auto Weatherford equipment into that environment? Do you look for contracts, do you kind of force the issue and try to push equipment out or how do you think about reactivating that equipment in a more uncertain environment for next year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I will say the following that the OneStim JV isn’t focussed on the next couple of quarters. We did this because we have the medium to long term view on the North American land market. There might be challenges overall in terms of the volume of the market but I think there is still going to be a significant core that’s going to withstand you know oil price challenges and still going to be profitable. And I think the combination of scale and efficiency and technology that we will bring and vertical integration is going to make OneStim very very competitive in any kind of market condition. So, obviously if activity was to flatten out for a period of time when you come early into 2018, then we will deploy what makes sense to deploy and the rest we will keep idle and ready for deploying later. So, we are not doing this for the next couple of quarters we are doing this for the medium to long term
Jud Bailey: Got it, okay thank you for that. And my follow up is just kind of following up on some of the offshore commentary. If we cannot stay in this $45 to $50 range for an extended period of time, how do you kind of think about the various pieces offshore, obviously you are seeing an uptick in FID activity, obviously everything shallow water activity continues to improve, but how do you think about deep water on kind of big projects towards on a longer term basis if we stay in this kind of environment for a prolonged period of time?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think if we stay in this environment for a long period of time, I think you will unlikely see large infrastructure projects whether it’s a significant gap between cash outlays and cash returns, but I still think that even in deep water there are opportunities for tiebacks and utilization of existing infrastructure tiebacks using you know multiface pumps and so forth, right. So there are opportunities that we are seeing through one SubSea which actually isn’t all concentrated on shallow water. There is a fair bit of deep water projects being considered unprepared for FID as well. So, but I think they are going to be all relatively short cycle in nature and we obviously we have a very bit position to participate in this and support our customers in getting those projects online.
Jud Bailey: Great. Right, thank you I’ll turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: All right. So thank you for that final questions. I would now like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed this morning. First, we remain positive on the oil markets inspite of the current negative sentiments that have created more uncertainty around the shape and the timing of the market recovery. We believe that globally E&P investments will need to increase significantly in the coming years to address the pending supply challenges resulting from three years of under investments. And Schlumberger is uniquely positioned to capture growth in all markets as global investments start to recover. Second, we have shown you why we believe in the potential of Schlumberger production management to provide an activity baseline to geomarket operations that also delivered full cycle returns that are highly accretive to our business. And third we are continuing to build out our offering both in terms of technology and geography. The OneStim joint venture with Weatherford add scale and technology to our integrated production services in North America land while our agreement to acquire a majority stake in EDC in Russia offers significant opportunities to expand our presence in the conventional land drilling market in Western Siberia. That concludes today’s call. Thank you for participating.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Thank you. Hello, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being hosted from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Simon Ayat and Patrick Schorn. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we’ll open up for questions. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I’d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we’ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat, who will present the first quarter corporate results and also review the results by group.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.25. This represent a decrease of $0.02 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the current quarter, we recorded $0.05 of Cameron merger and integration charges. Our first quarter revenue of $6.9 billion decreased 3% sequentially, largely driven by the Cameron Group as a result of project completions and reduced product sales. Pretax operating margin only decreased by 42 basis points to 11%. Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 3% sequentially, primarily due to project completions in Testing & Process systems and seasonally lower SIS software and multiclient license sales. These decreases were offset in part by progress on early production facility projects in the Middle East and the improved Wireline revenue in North America. Margin decreased 170 basis points to 17%, driven by the lower contribution from SIS software and multiclient sales. Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 1% sequentially, while margins were sequentially flat at 11.5%. Strong activity in North America was offset by lower activity and pricing pressure internationally across the group. Production Group revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 1% sequentially, and margins fell by 78 basis points to 5%. These results were primarily driven by strong pressure pumping activity and the pricing recovery in North America land, which was offset by seasonally lower completion product sales and lower SPM revenue. The Cameron Group revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 9% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by OneSubsea as a result of declining project volumes. Reduced product sales in Surface System and the further drop in Drilling System also contributed to the decline. Margins decreased 80 basis points to 13%. Despite the revenue decline, OneSubsea margins still exceeded 20% for the third straight quarter as a result of strong project execution. While the drilling backlog was essentially flat, the OneSubsea backlog increase largely reflected the Mad Dog 2 award. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle businesses increased to 1.1 in the first quarter. This marks the first time these businesses have been above 1 since the fourth quarter of 2013. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 15.3% in the first quarter compared to 15.8% in the previous quarter. Looking forward, the ETR will be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. With the continued recovery in North America, we anticipate that the ETR will increase next quarter and over the course of the year. We generated $656 million of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation as well as the payment of $140 million in severance during the quarter. We also continue to experience payment delays from certain customers, primarily in North – in Latin America. Our net debt increased $1.3 billion during the quarter to $11.4 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $7.6 billion. During the quarter, we spend $372 million to repurchase 4.7 million shares at an average price of $78.97. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included roughly $380 million on CapEx and the investments of approximately $145 million in SPM projects and $115 million in multiclient. During the quarter, we also made $696 million of dividend payments and $221 million in Borr Drilling. Full year 2017 CapEx, excluding SPM and multiclient investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.2 billion. And now I will turn the conference over to Patrick.
Patrick Schorn: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Starting off with North America. Our first quarter revenue increased 6% sequentially as growth in U.S. land and Western Canada was partially offset by further activity reductions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Canada. As expected, the North America land market continued to strengthen during the first quarter in terms of both activity and pricing, leading us to start full-scale deployment of idle capacity for most product lines. Revenue growth was led by hydraulic fracturing and drilling services, but also increasingly supported by Artificial Lift, Surface Systems and Valves & Measurements. In spite of our capacity reactivation being heavily back-end loaded as we continue to adhere to our profitable growth strategy, we still generated 16% sequential revenue growth in our hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling services in U.S. land. And even more importantly, we delivered incremental margins of 66% for these services combined in U.S. land, driven by productive customer engagements around pricing recovery and operational efficiency, together with timely resource additions, new technology sales and proactive supply chain management. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the first quarter revenue declined again sequentially as the deepwater rig count dropped 15 at the end of March, which represents a reduction of 74% compared to the peak activity level of 2014. In addition to the low drilling activity, we also saw a further sequential drop in seismic multiclient sales, leaving offshore revenues at unprecedented low levels. In parallel with these record low level activity, product and services pricing, as in several recent cases, fall into levels that make it impossible for us to uphold our operating standards and, at the same time, turn a profit in this extremely challenging operating environment. We are therefore in the process of redeploying both service capacity and technical support resources from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to other more viable markets. Internationally, the first quarter revenue fell 7% sequentially, driven by stronger-than-expected seasonal decline in activity and product sales in particularly in the North Sea, Russia land and China and also by lower sequential activity in key parts of the Middle East. On a positive note, revenues in Latin America were flat sequentially, confirming that this region has indeed reached the bottom of the cycle. The results were driven by solid activity in Brazil, further supported by multiclient seismic sales and strong OneSubsea and Cameron Drilling Systems activity. This was offset by a range of activity challenges impacting our hydraulic fracturing operations in Argentina, which has now been resolved, as well as production constraints imposed on our Shushufindi SPM project in Ecuador. Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa decreased 10% sequentially, driven primarily by the completion of a large OneSubsea project, lower Cameron Surface Systems sales, reduced SIS software license sales and a more severe seasonal reduction in drilling-related activity throughout Russia, Kazakhstan and the North Sea. Still, the activity in the Northern parts of ECA is expected to recover in the second quarter, and we maintain a constructive outlook for the year for both Russia and the North Sea. In Africa, revenue was flat sequentially, which clearly indicates that this region has also reached the bottom of the cycle. In North Africa, activity remained stable in Algeria during the first quarter, and we also started preparations for reentering Libya and expect to start a small-scale land operation in the second quarter after having been shut down on land for the past 3 years. Sub-Sahara Africa revenue was also flat sequentially as early termination of ongoing drilling activity in Angola and Gabon was offset by the start-up of 2 new deepwater projects in Congo and Senegal as well as by strong growth in land activity in Chad, Congo and Ethiopia. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 7% sequentially, driven by lower product sales from the Cameron Surface and Drilling Systems product lines and also by lower activity and service pricing pressures throughout the Middle East, particularly impacting the Production Group. In Asia, revenues in China and Australia were lower sequentially due to lower offshore drilling activity and by severe seasonal weather impacting our land operation in both countries. And finally, the first quarter revenue in Malaysia and Indonesia, flat sequentially, confirming that we have reached the bottom of the cycle also here but with no clear signs yet of any significant activity recovery in this region. With that, I will hand the call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Patrick. Following the review of our first quarter results from Simon and Patrick, I will next provide you with an updated business outlook. But before I do that, I would like to say a few words about the Cameron Group as we just passed the 1-year mark since the closing of the transaction. Over the past 12 months, we have successfully implemented the first phase of our integration plan, which included 3 main themes: first, the colocation of 1,700 employees into joint facilities around the world; second, combining Schlumberger and Cameron businesses to deliver enhanced offerings to our customers, such as our new Testing & Process systems product line; and third, bringing together Cameron and Schlumberger technologies, for instance, in hydraulic fracturing and in OneDrill and by launching as many as 32 integrated R&D projects to further expand our integrated technology offering. At the same time, OneSubsea, which is now in its fifth year of existence, has firmly established a leadership position in the subsea market through the pore-to-pipeline approach, as seen by the higher rate of project awards in recent quarters as well as their industry-leading operating margins. Overall, the entire Cameron integration program has exceeded the ambitious first year of synergy target we set and delivered approximately $400 million in operating income synergies as well as $600 million in new orders. The first quarter results from the Cameron Group were, again, very solid. And I would like to complement the entire Cameron organization and the integration team on a job well done, where they have jointly ensured that the largest transaction Schlumberger has done to date has turned out to be a great success. Turning next to the business outlook. We maintain our constructive view of the oil market, and we made further inventory growth in the second quarter, driven by the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts put in place in January. At present, the region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in 2017 is North America land, although investment levels in the Middle East and Russia are also expected to remain resilient this year. However, for the rest of the world, which still make up more than 50 million barrels per day of oil production, we are heading towards a third year of significant underinvestment, which increases the likelihood of a medium-term supply deficit as produced reserves are not replaced in sufficient volume. In particular, the market continues to focus on headline decline numbers that suggest that production is holding up well, while a closer examination of the underlying data clearly shows that the rate of depletion of proved undeveloped reserves is rapidly accelerating in several key non-OPEC countries. The current level of underinvestments is most visible in exploration, where the record-low investments, including both drilling and seismic, led to a total amount of industry discoveries of less than 5 billion barrels in 2016 versus a produced volume of over 30 billion barrels, dropping the industry-wide reserves-to-replacement ratio to 32%. Still at present, there is no clear sign of any general increase in exploration spend, with the one exception being Mexico, where we are seeing an increasing interest in the offshore multiclient surveys we have acquired over the past two years. Looking next at our business outlook by region. The recovery will clearly be led by North America land, where investment levels are expected to increase by 50% in 2017, leading to a strong increase in activity and an overdue correction to service and product pricing. Through the organic and inorganic investments we had made in our North America land business in recent years, we are very well set up to take a leading position in serving our customers in the coming growth cycle. In drilling, we have built a market-leading position by expanding our offering through the Smith and M-I SWACO acquisitions and through a broad organic R&D program targeting the North America land market. As drilling complexity continues to increase with even longer laterals, our purpose design technologies are starting to have a significant impact on our customers’ drilling performance. One example of this is the strong uptake of our AxeBlade drillbit, which by itself has demonstrated a record 35% increase in rate of penetration for Matador in the Permian. Furthermore, our PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable technology continues to be sold out for a third successive quarter and in an 80-well campaign for Parsley Energy in the Midland and Delaware basins. This technology contributed to a 17% reduction in the average drilling time per well and a 30% reduction in the drilling cost per lateral foot. Both of these examples show the performance potential new technologies hold in the North America land market and demonstrate the growth opportunities for our drilling offering as we continue to prepare for the introduction of our OneDrill platform in the second half of this year. We are also starting to see strong growth momentum in North America land for our market-leading Artificial Lift offering, where we recently also acquired a 49.9% stake in the HEAL technology from Production Plus Energy Services based in Calgary. HEAL, which can be used in wells together with our ESP plunger lift and rod lift offering, reduces fluid slugging, depresses form generation, contains solid and separates gas, which altogether improves production and reduces the need for workovers. We are presently at the introduction stage of this exciting new technology, which, over the first 140 installations, have delivered an average production increase of 45%. Within our hydraulic fracturing and completions offering, we have also made significant investments in recent years, including the development of a fully automated surface delivery system and also by acquiring our own sand mines and the associated vertically integrated distribution system, which will greatly improve our full-cycle returns. In terms of well productivity, the market offtake of our geoengineered completions continues to grow, and the offering is delivering significant value for our customers, as seen by the 18-well program we recently completed for Lonestar Resources in the Eagle Ford Shale. Here, we optimize drilling, stimulation and completion plans across the long laterals, supported by our drillbit formation BroadBand Sequence diversion technology. As a result, the wells produced up to 86% more hydrocarbon per 1,000 feet of lateral compared to offset wells in two other fields. With proppant prices and distribution costs now starting to rapidly increase, we are also expecting to see a recovery in the use of our HiWAY technology, which reduces proppant use by 40% and water use by 25%. Building on this broad technology platform, the pending OneStim JV with Weatherford will give us the required scale in terms of both hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions technologies to drive efficiency and market penetration in all the unconventional basins in North America land. At this stage, the regulatory filings have been completed. And as we await the required approvals to close the OneStim transaction, the integration teams are making all the necessary preparations for a successful day 1 of the new company. Looking next at Latin America. The flat sequential revenue in the first quarter was a long-awaited positive confirmation that this market has indeed reached the bottom of the cycle. Going forward, there are emerging positive signs for our business in the region, including opportunities for new commercial models in Brazil as Petrobras continues its assets divestment program and as a new focus is brought to mature land basins. In Argentina, new plans to bring stability to natural gas prices should lead to higher investment levels. And we are also excited about our recent agreement with YPF for a joint development in the Vaca Muerta Shale. In Europe, CIS and Africa, we see strengthening activity in the North Sea, Russia and the Caspian region in the coming quarters as the winter season ends and new projects start up. In Africa, we expect some activity improvement in the North as we start up a small-scale land operation in Libya after being shut down for the past three years. While we see a slow but steady improvement in Sub-Saharan Africa over the coming quarters, driven by a mix of land activity in Chad, Congo and Ethiopia and a limited number of deepwater start-ups in Congo, Guinea and the Ivory Coast. In the Middle East, activity will continue to be driven by the GCC countries. However, we do not expect significant sequential growth from this region over the coming quarters. While in Asia, we will see the normal seasonal recovery in China. Overall, it’s clear that activity in the international market has reached bottom in all regions. But even though we see positive signs in many countries, we expect only moderate sequential activity growth in the coming quarters. This slower recovery, lingering pricing pressure, means that we will likely face another challenging year in the international markets while we expect an acceleration of the activity growth towards the back end of 2017 and into 2018. With this market backdrop, we continue to actively position Schlumberger at the forefront of an industry that needs to evolve. We do this by proactively managing our base business and responding to ongoing pressures of commoditization by tailoring our offering, resources and service performance to changing market conditions. In parallel, we constantly look to expand our opportunity set in a period where the industry, in many ways, lacks overall direction. This includes driving a broad and very active M&A program, engaging with existing and new customers to establish closer collaboration and more aligned business models and also expanding our offering from technical support to now also taking a financial position alongside our customers in applicable projects, all with the aim of generating more activity for our 19 product lines. As we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic about the future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of opportunity for the industry players that are ready and able to think new and to act new. Thank you. With that, we will open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey good afternoon, Paal
Paal Kibsgaard: Good afternoon. So given that you guys are holding your call from the Kingdom, the board meeting was held in the Kingdom as well, I’d love to hear kind of what – as you and the board talk about strategic focus over the next several quarters but also several years and talk about the implementation of those strategies, what are the key kind of top 1, 2, 3 items that you or that Schlumberger is most focused on in the near-term and especially given your broad international focus? And I think we understand where you stand in North America.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you are asking about in particular in Saudi Arabia, let me first say that the board has spent actually a full week in Saudi Arabia, in between Jeddah, Riyadh, Shaybah and Dhahran. We have visited the KAUST University, a range of government institutions focused on science, technology and innovation. And of course, we spent a lot of time with our largest customer, Saudi Aramco, both at their headquarters in Dhahran and then in their field operations in the South in Shaybah. Now the board had a particular interest in broadening its understanding of both the Vision 2030 for the country as well as the In-Kingdom Total Value Add program, which is also very important, and in particular, how Schlumberger continues to actively support these programs and also how we further strengthen our position in the kingdom. Now as part of our visit, we also have the privilege of meeting His Excellency, Khalid Al-Falih, to discuss the state of the oil market, which was also very useful for our board to do. Now everywhere we went, we had been met by exceptional hospitality, and the board was actually very impressed with everything that we saw and everything that is going on in the kingdom. So this has really served as a further extension of our understanding of all the details that was going on in the country, and that is helping both the board and the senior management team, which was also here to further adjust and, I would say, accelerate our plans of investment in the country.
James West: Okay, that’s great. It’s very helpful, Paal. And maybe just a quick follow-up for me. You recently announced the new special venture fund, and you made some very quick moves there with that fund. Could you perhaps elaborate a little bit on the mandate here for the fund and what you see as the opportunity set?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So just to be clear on what the fund is, so this is a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers. And this is basically to enable closer collaboration and alignment with our customers. It is also there to facilitate and support additional E&P investments and also for us, very importantly, to secure preferred supplier agreements for our products and services for whatever these investments that we facilitate. So this is the overall driver behind it. Now we understand that many of our customers do not see a need for this, but some customers do, and the key principle for us that this fund and these investment opportunities is open to all customers. So the basic thing here is that it’s simply aiming to enable growth and in the base business. Now the scope of the fund, again, is relatively open. We will evaluate each project based on its stand-alone merits. We haven’t, at this stage, set the limits for the size of the fund. But I think importantly as well, they are also open to possibly co-invest with third parties. And obviously, the fund will be subject to the same, I would say, governance and risk management processes that we have for the base business, and ultimately, all the investment decisions will be approved by our CFO. So it’s something that is in place to facilitate further growth for the base business. I think that’s the best summary of it.
James West: Okay, great. Thanks, Paul.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, James.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning. Good afternoon, guys as well.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Angie Sedita: So Paal, so could we go back to the U.S. a little bit? And obviously, the OneStim is a surprising JV and interesting to see. So can you talk a little bit about your strategy there as far as redeploying the frac fleet into the U.S. market and if you could even have a target horsepower as you exit 2017 and maybe a little bit about the logistics of the JV?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I think we need to separate the JV from our current hydraulic fracturing business in North America land. The JV will obviously include all that business when it’s closed. But as of now, we continue to manage our business in a stand-alone fashion while we are preparing obviously to close the JV as soon as possible. So I will comment briefly on our plans for activation of capacity for the base business today, and I’ll have Patrick give a few comments around the OneStim JV and the plans post-closure. So if you look at the situation today on our fracking business, we’ve always said that as soon as we have a clear pathway towards profitability, we will start actively reactivating our idle capacity. This point in time – actually past in the first quarter, so towards the back end of the first quarter, we actually started actively reactivating our idle capacity. And this process is going to accelerate in the second quarter and also going into H2. So based on the current plan we have at this stage, we plan to have our entire idle capacity from the Schlumberger side deployed during the fourth quarter of this year. So this is the current plan of reactivation. We are getting, I would say, significant traction on pricing. We are actively hiring people both for the wellsite operations and for the vertical integration part, including the transportation side of things as well. And I think the balance we have between the insourcing of our vertical supply chain, together with still a very close working relationship with our suppliers – and just to be clear, we are not looking to fully vertically integrate. We will have a certain amount of our capacity vertically integrated, and we will continue also to work closely with our suppliers, both on the sand mine side as well as transportation and distribution. So we will continue now in the coming quarters to actively redeploy. And obviously, when we close the OneStim JV, these resources and these businesses will all be combined in OneStim, which will then just continue on the same process. So Patrick, you want to say a few words about where we stand on OneStim and plans?
Patrick Schorn: Sure. Regarding the OneStim joint venture, which is a 70-30 joint venture with Weatherford for North America land for hydraulic fracturing and completion, it really creates a new industry leader in terms of hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions. Through its scale, it will offer a cost-effective and competitive service delivery platform, which is clearly positioned to provide customers with leading operational efficiency and best-in-class hydraulic fracturing and completion technologies. Importantly, reliable equipment availability for our customers, and it will also improve significantly the full-cycle shareholder returns from this particular market. So in this case, Weatherford is contributing its leading multistage completions portfolio, around 1 million horsepower in pumping equipment and the pump down perforating business. And what we will end up with is a very capital-efficient structure, pulling the hydraulic horsepower to gain economies of scale, which clearly is very much from the current market recovery. I’ll leave it with that.
Angie Sedita: Okay, thank you. That’s very helpful color. So as a unrelated follow-up. Maybe you can give a little bit of color on Cameron and what your outlook is for subsea overall as far as large projects and pricing and even the rig of the future, any update there.
Paal Kibsgaard: Patrick, do you want to cover that?
Patrick Schorn: Sure. So firstly, we exceeded our first year synergy targets, and we realized approximately $400 million in savings there. And we already secured around $600 million in new synergy orders. So from that perspective, the transaction is working well, and the integration is going extremely well. So what we are focused on in Cameron is really creating a fully integrated drilling and production system, combining our leading well and subsurface offering with Cameron’s leading service technology, further leveraging instrumentation and software control and optimization capabilities. During Q1, overall the revenue was seasonally down, driven mainly by OneSubsea and Surface Systems as Surface and V&M posted double [indiscernible] in U.S. land and a step change in bookings. And that is maybe the most important, as was already mentioned by Simon as well, where we are starting to see that the book to bill is starting to go over 1. The margin decline somewhat, but through strong execution and cost control, we limited the margin decline to approximately 88 basis points.
Paal Kibsgaard: All right. Next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer: Thank you very much. I’m wondering, Paal or Simon, whether you could elaborate a little bit on the increased participation in customer projects under SPM. You highlighted in the prepared remarks that payments from certain Latin American customers have slowed down. And – how do you see the evolution, the impact on return on capital, how big really the committed capital become? I think that’s a line of questioning I think, I guess, in every single investor meeting when the topic of Schlumberger comes up.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I’ll say, going back to what I mentioned about the fund, Ole, the fund itself is there to facilitate growth in the base business. So the way we look at the fund is that if we do make investments alongside our customers, these investments will need to meet the return criteria that we have overall as a company and also the base business that we get associated with the project. Through preferred supplier agreements, we’d also obviously need to meet the same return criteria. So I think the way to look at the fund is that we have a strong balance sheet. We have strong cash flow, and we have a fair bit of cash on hand. And what we are doing on a selective basis is looking for investment opportunities to facilitate more base business for the company. Our revenues are still at around 50% of what they were eight, nine quarters ago. And we are trying very actively to make sure that we can get baseline growth not just in North America land, but also globally. And given the capability set we have as a company, in particular around subsurface understanding and drilling and completions, we see this as a very good way of a thing to drive, I would say, short and medium-term activity. But very importantly, these contracts that we enter into here could have durations of 10 to 15 to 20 years, which will also provide us with a very good baseline of activity and earnings throughout the coming cycles as well. So I don’t think there should be a huge reason for concern around the capital intensity. We have capital available to invest, and we are trying to invest this wisely into projects that have good returns stand-alone but also that facilitates growth opportunities for the base business.
Ole Slorer: Okay, thank you. And on the revenue synergies with Cameron, $600 million, it’s very difficult for us to see what would that come to with or without the joint venture. So can you elaborate a little bit about what type of business is it that you’ve signed up that you don’t think either Schlumberger or Cameron would have achieved on a stand-alone basis? And maybe the context of that, also comment a little bit on your rationale between – by investing in – it will have in Borr?
Paal Kibsgaard: Patrick, why don’t you talk about Cameron? I’ll cover Borr when you’re done with that.
Patrick Schorn: All right. So talking about some of the examples of revenue synergies, I think one of the – your previous one is clearly the expanding of Cameron’s geographical reach and using as such the Schlumberger existing footprint to reach a far larger customer base. What it also helps with is accelerating the implementation of the OneSubsea vision and plans as the cooperation between the companies is much closer today. And the – one of the first points we had brought up when we started talking about the opportunities was addressing the significant industry NPT issues related to BOPs. And here, you have to really think about monitoring and how we could optimize the use in that side. And then where we really focus, and this might link into what you – what we have discussed in the past when it comes to issues like rig of the future is creating a integrated drilling system, which would include all the service and service components that we offer, and obviously then optimize the drilling process to such an extent that neither one of the single companies could achieve. That is really the main examples of revenue synergies.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. Thanks, Patrick. So Ole, let me just comment quickly on Borr then. So – and as you’ve seen, we made a $221 million investment to take a 20% stake in this new company. There are several drivers behind the investment, but the main driver is really to create a platform where we can collaborate closely with Borr to offer performance drilling offshore in shallow water. We see this as, I think, a significant opportunity for Schlumberger and also for Borr to offer this new type of contract model, which is now heavily used on land but also now to be used in shallow water. Just for the record, we are also open to work with other and offer drillers on the similar type of performance contracts. Now back to Borr, Borr also represents a significant potential market for Cameron drilling, both in terms of BOP, sand and drilling packages. And I would say lastly, looking at the company and the plans going forward, we also expect this to be a very good financial investment. So this is the main rationale behind investment.
Ole Slorer: Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Ole.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Thanks. Good morning. A question with regard to the incrementals that you generated in Lower 48 for frac and directional 66%, I think, for Q1. Patrick and Paal, just given the reactivation slate that you have in front of you, which is – seems to be pretty large, do you expect to generate either that level of profit improvement over the course of this year or something within that neighborhood as you reactivate assets? The rest of the industry seems to have difficulty with regard to revenue growth and converging that with profit improvement that hasn’t happened. But in your case, it looks like the profit improvement was actually fairly considerable. And I’m just curious as to the relationship between reactivation growth and margin improvement in light of that.
Paal Kibsgaard: That’s a good question. So I would kind of split it into 2. When it comes to the onetime cost of reactivating, yes, we will have some impact of that in the coming quarters. I would say the – but the underlying incrementals that we’re aiming for is going to be around this level. But we will be subject to some additional activation costs, I would say in the – probably in the second and the third quarter, which might, for those 2 quarters, basically deliver slightly lower incrementals overall. But the underlying, I would say, drive we have between getting customer price increases and driving efficiency through scale as we reactivate and also managing our supply chain, underlying, we are aiming for those type of incrementals, which we have talked about for the company for the past couple of years. We will have some headwinds around onetime reactivation costs in the coming quarters. But beyond that, we are looking to manage at this level.
Bill Herbert: Oka, thank you. And then secondly, with regard to Shushufindi and I guess the challenges that were reported in the media in recent weeks with regard to Ecuador, can you update us with regard to what the forward path on that project looks like?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I can. And first of all, let me just clarify that we have several SPM projects in Ecuador.
Bill Herbert: Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard: And the issues we are discussing are only pertaining to Shushufindi, right?
Bill Herbert: Okay.
Paal Kibsgaard: Now just to give you some background on Shushufindi, we are now in the fifth successful year of operations there. And in between the Shushufindi Consortium, which we lead, and Petroamazonas, the state oil company, we have a very solid governance model, and we have annual budgets and annual production targets, which are set and agreed. And if you go back for these 5 years, we have exceeded all these production targets. But what has happened is that with the lower oil price, this has led to cash flow challenges for Petroamazonas. And they are also selling the oil that we produce from the Shushufindi field. So they are basically then falling behind on our payments, and this is really the key issue. So the proposal they have made to address the payment issues is not acceptable, and the situation over the first quarter has been further aggravated by the fact that they have imposed also production constraints on the outputs from the Shushufindi field. So bottom line, we find this treatment of a partner, who has made significant investments in the country, somewhat disappointing. But still, we are very confident that the issues are going to be resolved, either amicably by – or by using the dispute resolution provisions that are in the contract. So that’s kind of where we are. How long it’s going to take to get it resolved, I can’t say at this stage. But we are ready to sit down again and continue discussions, and there have been a number of meetings and discussions over the past couple of months. We are ready to continue these discussions as soon as the imposed production constraints are lifted.
Bill Herbert: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.
DavidAnderson: Thanks. Paal, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the weakness in the Middle East you saw this quarter. It was mentioned a few times in the release, and I guess the pricing pressure wasn’t a huge surprise. But the activity reduction did stand out to me. I was just wondering, is there a specific country that’s experiencing this? And do you think this comes back later in the year? Or is it more of an adjustment to the drilling programs? I just wondered if you could just provide a little bit more color on the GCCs.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So I wouldn’t use the word weakness, David. I think the – we have a slight decline in overall activity and revenue in the Middle East. Obviously all declines in Asia that weighs in on the overall EMEA numbers. So I don’t think there’s anything that concerns or so worries us that should concern or worry you. But we are not seeing any significant growth in the coming quarters. We are slightly down, like I said, sequentially [indiscernible]. This is more around, I would say, project mix…
David Anderson: Okay.
Paal Kibsgaard: …priorities and so forth, right? So I would say the underlying business in the Middle East is very resilient. There are strong and clear plans in each of the countries we operate here. And so no major worries. It’s just that there is no, I would say, significant steady sequential growth either in Q1 or in the coming quarters, just a very steady resilient base business.
David Anderson: Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up would be on the offshore side. Seems like IOC just doesn’t seem eager to invest offshore. We haven’t really seen much on the step-out and tieback front. I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate. We talked in the past about maybe 5 to 8 big projects potentially being announced in the back part of the year. Has your views on kind of offshore kind of shifted a little bit? I was just wondering if you could help us, kind of what is the road map you think to recovery in offshore? Is this kind of, again, pushed out maybe more to an 2018 event when we start seeing some of these projects awarded.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, we see the same as you. And so there hasn’t – so far of significant FIDs, plans being discussed of the things going on offshore. We – if you look at jack-up utilization, I think there is a slight uptick on it. So I think there’s probably some early signs that we’ll get some light work coming our way as an industry in the next couple of quarters. But in terms of bigger projects, I agree with you, we haven’t seen anything yet. So I think the main thing here is, I think for the IOC customers to basically get a better medium-term view on oil prices, and obviously, the positive uptick we’ve seen over the past couple of quarters is a good thing. But I would assume that I’m also looking for what the floor could be and maybe awaiting potentially what OPEC is going to do as we go into the May – the late May meeting around whether they extend the production cuts or not. So I agree with you. I think the increase in offshore activity or shallow water activity is probably more going to be a second half of the year event, leading into 2018. So with that, though, it’s still very important for us as a company to at least secure the work that is coming out of projects that are being FID-ed. And that’s why we are very happy and excited, the fact that we landed the Mad Dog 2 project, for instance.
David Anderson: Great. Thank you, Paul.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jim Wicklund: Good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Jim
Jim Wicklund: A lot of questions asked, so if I could drill down a little bit on North America. Patrick, you made comments about the increased vertical participation in sand and additional sand mines. Can you tell us what you guys have done here in the last couple of quarters in terms of assuring capacity, delivery and making a little extra money, I guess, too, in North America in sand?
Patrick Schorn: Yes, I’ll cover that, Jim. So what we have done, we basically started this vertical integration investment program towards the back end of 2014. And we have made a number of investments in sand mines, which are now starting to come on production. And in addition to that, we obviously also invested further into owning railcars, owning transloading facilities. And we also are now – we have established our own trucking fleet, where we are now hiring people into manning the trucks that we have bought and that we are currently buying. So – but just to be clear, we are not looking to fully vertically integrate. We will have a certain amount of our capacity in it. We will do a fair bit of it, but we are still going to rely on the long-term suppliers that we’ve had both in upturn as well as in the – in future downturns. But we see the investments that we make into this, with the rapid cost inflations that you typically see starting at this part of the cycle, as a very good investment and a way to insulate ourselves from the massive supply chain inflation that we saw in the previous cycle, right? So it’s going to be a balancing between vertical integration, 100% owned by us, as well as using the supply chain capabilities that we have in the open market.
Jim Wicklund: Okay. And my follow-up in kind of the same vein, you talk about the completion capacity and what it would brings in OneStim. I know that 80% of the completions that we do in the U.S., 80% plus what – are plug-and-perf. And sliding sleeves, this has been marginalized. I know that Weatherford does both plug-and-perf and sliding sleeves. What is Schlumberger’s view of how those 2 technologies are going to develop? And is everything going to be plugged and parked in a couple of years? Or can you talk about where that technology is going to go? We don’t really know a whole lot of details about the breakdown of Weatherford stations both, frankly, and yours in that regard. So if you could give us some guidance on where the market is headed, that would be appreciated.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. Well, I think first of all, the multistage completion offering that Weatherford brings into the JV and also combined with ours will have a complete range of both open-hole and cased-hole solutions. Now if you look at where the market has been heading, I would say in the last 3, 4, 5 years, it has been gradually moving more and more to plug-and-perf with less, I would say, open-hole completions and sliding sleeves. There’s still more of that type of completions in Canada compared to what you have in U.S. land. So I would say that we are basically set up for – if the market continues the current trend towards more plug-and-perf in cased hole or whether there is a reemergence of the open hole, right? So I think we have a very good balance, and we can go either way. I think it’s going to come down to well performance productivity and completion costs in terms of what’s going to govern this, but we are adjusted well in either way, Jim.
Jim Wicklund: Okay. Thank you guys very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good afternoon. Where you are?
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you very much.
Kurt Hallead: Great. Awesome information flow so far. So I figured I’d kind of get right to the crux of probably what a lot of people are trying to gauge from all this great information, is how do you feel about the progression on The Street numbers as we look out into the second quarter?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, there – and there, the question came. That’s good. Well, I would say that in the second quarter, first of all, at the high level, we are expecting to see a continuation of the main trends that we saw in the first quarter. And then if you break our North America and international, for North America, we expect solid top line growth in Q3. And this is going to be driven, again, by what we saw in Q1 as well: further growth in the rig activity; for us, additional pricing and market share gains in directional drilling; and also, as we talked about earlier on the call, an acceleration of the capacity reactivation in fracking. Now underlying incremental margins, as I commented on earlier, should be solid. But in Q2 and probably Q3 as well, they’re going to be partly offset by some of these onetime start-up costs that we are having. And also, in the second quarter, we are as usual also footing the cost of the Canadian breakup. But overall, I would say strong top line growth and decent earnings growth for us in North America in the second quarter, with some small headwinds around the start-up costs. Internationally, as I said earlier, we have reached bottom in all markets. But for the second quarter, we only see, at this stage, flat underlying activity in Q2. So the – really, the only growth that we are going to see in the second quarter is going to be limited to the seasonal recovery in the North Sea, Russia and China. Now on the Cameron side, revenue is also expected to be more or less flat, where we are seeing solid growth in the short-cycle businesses of surface and V&M. But this is going to be offset by the slowing decline now in the long-cycle businesses of OneSubsea and drilling. So if you combine all of these, I believe that a sequential EPS growth of around 15% to 20% between Q1 and Q2 is a reasonable expectation.
Kurt Hallead: Great, that’s fantastic. Now based on your commentary about pricing pressures in the international market, and – it sounded like recovery still at hand in the second half of the year internationally than it would – I guess we can assume that the first quarter is going to be the low point for earnings of the year, and then you get sequential growth throughout the year. Is that kind of how you see it setting up?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. In principle, yes. I would say, like I said, the underlying activity internationally, Q2 isn’t showing any great signs of improving. But we will have at least the seasonal recovery in some of the key markets to help us. In terms of the pricing, we are still seeing continued pricing pressure on new tenders, but at the same time, some of this, we are looking to offset by exiting our unsustainable contracts. We still have some of these contracts that we are looking to resolve either by shutting the contract down or by getting the pricing increases that we need in order to make this a viable business proposition for us. So yes, I would say in principle, the Q1 should be the low end of earnings for the year in international market, with still only limited growth in Q2 but more of an acceleration in the second half of the year.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, great. Thank you. And then maybe quick follow-up here just on your commentary about the investing alongside your customers in the YPF deal and Borr Drilling and so on. So Paal, you guys have indicated in the past that all your SPM investments have effectively been margin and returns accretive in aggregate compared to the corporate average. As you’re making more and more investments in the year, like, what is the criteria, right? How should we think about it? If you’re going to invest, say, $200 million in Borr Drilling, how do we think about that in terms of incremental revenue or incremental profitability? Could you give us just some general gauge on how to assess that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, the investments in the equity of Borr Drilling should bring a return on investment or capital employed, which is accretive to the company. That’s why we made the company – that’s why we made the investments. And for future investments, that’s, again, what we are going to look for when we spend cash on this type of investments. Hand in hand with that is also obviously the revenue opportunity that this brings. And with this, like I said, we’re going to focus in on two things. With that big fleet of jack-ups, this is a very good market potential for Cameron drilling, but even more importantly, what we are really driving at here is to introduce performance drilling in the offshore markets. So this is just one example. But when we make these investments, there will be synergies and business opportunities and revenue opportunities associated with them. The investments will stand on their own 2 feet, and we aim for them to be accretive to our return on capital employed for the company. But they all need to be associated with the business opportunities for the rest of the company.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, that’s great. I appreciate that color. Thank you so much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Waqar Syed: Thank you for taking my question. My question relates to Cameron, some of the recent projects that you’ve entered into, Mad Dog and others. How should we look – think about long-term margins for these new projects versus what OneSubsea has been generating before?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, obviously, if you look at the commercial environment at this stage versus the commercial environment three years ago when the project that we are currently executing were bid, it’s obviously more challenging. So to think that we can, I would say, achieve the exactly same margins on these latest projects that we are currently delivering on OneSubsea, that might be challenging. But I would say for all the bids that we are making and the contracts that we ultimately secure, we have very clear return expectations on them, somewhat lower than what OneSubsea is currently operating at. But we are still looking for this to be a very good business for us going forward, and continuous improvement – for instance, OneSubsea is showing and the plans they have in place going forward as well to even further improve the way they execute projects. There should also be opportunities for the projects we bid and secure at this phase to have potentially margin upsides as we go forward. So it’s a tough business, but I would say I’m very pleased with how OneSubsea is navigating the commercial environment and also executing and delivering on the projects that we take on.
Waqar Syed: And then just my follow-up question on integration-related expenses. When do you think you’re going to stop reporting those?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we – as we said earlier, we will continue to be reporting them, announcing them separately for the year. But starting next year, we will drop this. This is normally our style. For the first year after the acquisition, we continue to incur them and announce them. And from there on, they become part of our ongoing run rate of cost.
Waqar Syed: Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Waqar. So just before we close this morning, I’d like to summarize the three most important points that we’ve discussed. First, the only region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in 2017 is North America land, where activity has been growing for the last few quarters. And in line with our profitable growth strategy, we have begun redeploying our idle capacity in pressure pumping, and we will accelerate this in the second quarter. Through the organic and inorganic investments we had made in our North America land business over the past seven years, we are very well positioned to take a leading customers as they expand their activity in the coming year. Second, the performance of our international areas in the first quarter confirmed our belief that activity has now reached bottom in all regions. And although we see positive signs in many countries, both on land and offshore, we expect only moderate sequential growth over the coming quarters. The slower speed of recovery, together with the lingering pricing pressure, means that we expect another challenging year in the international markets in 2017 before a clearer acceleration of activity in 2018. And third, as we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic about the future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of opportunity for the industry players that are ready to think new and to act new. Thank you very much for listening in.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full year 2016 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board Meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Rowe, President, Cameron Group. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon, Scott and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, then Scott will provide an update on the Cameron business, integration and synergies, and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. I'll now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.27. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.38 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter we recorded $536 million of restructuring charges, $76 million of Cameron related merger and integration charges, and the $63 million charge relating to the devaluation of the Egyptian Pound. The restructuring charges largely relate to workforce reduction and facility closure, plus as we continue to rationalize our support structure and reduce our facility footprint. All of these charges are described in our earnings press release. Our fourth-quarter revenue of $7.1 billion increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by the production group. Pretax operating margins only declined by 21 basis points sequentially to 11.4%. This was largely due to the revenue mix. Margins also benefited from the continued cost management actions across the entire organization. Sequential highlights by product group were as follows; fourth quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion was essentially flat sequentially, as increases in testing and process and [SIS] were offset by declines in wireline and WesternGeco. Pre-tax operating margin decreased 49 basis points to 18.6% as the increased contribution from software sales were more than offset by the decrease in high margin wireline activity. Drilling group revenue of $2 billion was also flat sequentially, although margin increased 81 basis points to 11.6%. The margin improvement was primarily driven by the revenue mix and strong cost control. Production group revenue of $2.12 billion increased 5%, while margin increased 134 basis points to [6%]. These increases were driven by stronger welfare activity both in the Middle East and [Indiscernible]. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion was essentially flat as increases in OneSubsea and surface were offset by lower drilling and balance and measurement activity. Margins decreased 207 basis points due to the drop in drilling projects. Cameron was accretive to both Schlumberger’s pre-tax operating margin as well as earnings per share in 2016. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 15.8% in the fourth quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Looking forward, the ETR would be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. We anticipate that the ETR will gradually increase over the course of 2017 as a result of the expected improvement in activity in North America. Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During all of 2016, we generated $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter we generated $2 billion of cash flow from operation. This is all despite paying severance payments of approximately $150 million during the fourth quarter and making $950 million of severance and transaction-related payments associated with the acquisition of Cameron during 2016. Although receivable collection improved in Q4, we continue to experience payment delays from some of our customers. Our net debt improved by $46 million on a sequential basis to $10.1 billion. During 2016, we returned $3.4 billion of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback. We have also increased our dividend in seven of the last 10 years. As you know, every January we review the dividend with our board. Given the current situation and our level of the [operation] we have decided to maintain our dividend at $0.50 per quarter. This will provide us with the flexibility to continue to invest in the business and take advantage of several opportunities as they present themselves. We will continue to return excess cash that we generate through our buyback program. During the fourth quarter we spent $116 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $78.21. For the full year of 2016 we spent $778 million to repurchase 11 million shares at an average price of [$70.08] per share. As a reminder, last year our board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program, which will take effect once our current program is exhausted this year. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $654 million on Capex, and invested approximately $160 million in SPM projects, $130 million in multi-client projects. Full year 2017 Capex, excluding multiclient and SPM investment, is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and now I turn the conference over to Scott.
Robert Scott Rowe: Thank you, Simon. The Cameron Group had another good quarter under Schlumberger, and I am pleased to report that we continue to exceed expectations with the integration. I will give you a brief update on the fourth quarter and the full year, as well as provide some comments as to how we are thinking about 2017. We delivered $1.3 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter, which was flat sequentially despite the reduced backlog. EBIT margins were a healthy 14% but lower than Q3 by 200 basis points, which is consistent with our prior thinking and communication on the last earnings call. The lower margin is driven by the reduced volumes in our higher-margin drilling business coupled with reduced pricing throughout the downturn that is now fully flowing through the system. OneSubsea, however, continued to have outstanding margins, which exceeded 20% for the second straight quarter. Our persistent focus on cost control and the acceleration of the integration program has allowed us to deliver high relative margins throughout 2016. While the Cameron Group backlog decline began in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill ratio remained flat sequentially at 0.8. Additionally we had several major awards in the quarter that demonstrate market-leading positions and our ability to capitalize on the limited opportunity in the marketplace. In our drilling business, we received two different long-term service contracts, totaling more than $350 million from Transocean. Schlumberger will be providing comprehensive services to ensure maximum uptime and reliability of the Cameron pressure control systems on their rig. The structure of these contracts [Indiscernible] of the service provider, drilling contractor and operator. Additionally we will be deploying the latest technology on censors, diagnostics and condition based monitoring to drive further reliability and uptime in deepwater drilling. This type of collaboration will systematically help to drive down the cost of deepwater developments and potentially unlock future projects. While secured in the fourth quarter, this award was not booked in the fourth quarter, and will be booked over the life of the 10-year contract. The reduction in the drilling backlog of $258 million was primarily driven by the removal of five of the seven [Brazil] blowout preventer orders in the amount of $128 million, which we believe are unlikely to progress given the current issues in Brazil. OneSubsea received two significant awards in the quarter as well. One award was for the industry’s first deepwater integrated subsea engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning of a multi-phase boosting system for the Dalmatian field in Gulf of Mexico for Murphy Oil Company. Working with Subsea 7 we will deploy, install and commission a 35 km tieback, multiphase boosting system to augment natural production for the Dalmatian field. OneSubsea also booked our first subsea tree for Statoil. While we have had a long relationship with Statoil, we had previously not participated in their subsea production systems project. The award of the two well of Utgard project was the result of a multiyear effort to prove our technology and execution capability to Statoil. We are very happy to be working with Statoil on this project and we expect to continue working with Statoil to drive cost reductions and improve productivity on their future projects. Our [Vietnam] and surface business responded to the increased activity in North America last quarter, and we predict that these two businesses will outperform in the second half of 2017 given their strong market positions coupled with their broad international reach. The integration of Cameron into Schlumberger has been an enormous task. Most of the heavy lifting in the integration is now complete. We achieved our year one target of $300 million of synergies in the first 10 months of the acquisition and we fully expect to exceed the $600 million target for the second year. The transaction was again accretive in the fourth quarter as well as accretive to the full year results for Schlumberger. We booked $118 million of synergy-related business in the fourth quarter with the majority of it coming from the Middle East. We will continue to have an integration team in 2017, and our focus will shift from cost synergies to growth synergies. Several technologies will be commercialized in 2017 that will drive incremental revenue and margin. Finally, we continue to find opportunities around the world and [Indiscernible] expansive footprint of Schlumberger. The first quarter will be a low for the Cameron Group in both revenue and margins due to the reduced backlog and the normal cyclical nature of our business. However, I expect the Cameron Group to grow continually from the second quarter onwards as we leverage our North American position and capitalize on the growth from our expanded international presence under Schlumberger. In summary, 2016 was a challenging year for the Cameron Group as we worked through the downturn and integrated into Schlumberger. However, I could not be more pleased with the approach by Schlumberger throughout this integration and with the performance of the Cameron people and organization. Despite the challenges, we delivered strong results throughout the year and we are positioned better than any of our peers to fully capitalize on the growing opportunity in 2017. I'll now turn it over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. Our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 1% sequentially to reach $7.1 billion as growth in North America land and robust activity in the Middle East largely offset continued weakness in Latin America and seasonal declines in other parts of the world. Our overall activity and financial performance led to a second successive quarter with a small but positive increase in earnings per share. In parallel with this operational stabilization we have completed the restructuring of the company, which in the fourth quarter included a further reduction of our global support structure to reflect current activity to capacity and customer pricing levels. These latest actions follow the well established playbook we have used to navigate the unprecedented industry challenges faced over the past two years. In this our focus has been on proactively streamlining our cost and support structure and continuing to drive the underlying efficiency and quality of all our business workflows. In parallel, we have also significantly expanded our offering through continued investments in [R&E] and a strategic M&A program, and through these actions we have further strengthened our market position compared to when we entered the downturn two years ago. Next I will review the fourth quarter business trends from our global operations and I will focus my comments on the results and activities for the Characterization Drilling & Production Groups as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group. In North America, overall revenue increased 4% sequentially driven by an improving land business in the US and Western Canada as drilling and completions activity increased and service pricing started to recover. In terms of technology, we saw the strongest growth on land in pressure pumping, followed by directional drilling, drill bits and drilling fluids as well as ESP, PCP and [rodless] product line. Offshore revenue declined again sequentially as the recon dropped further and pricing remained under pressure in spite of the significant technical and operational challenges in this market. The resulting business environment is potentially becoming unsustainable for us and will either lead to a recovery in service pricing or a narrowing of our service offering with re-deployment of resources to markets that offer more adequate returns. Internationally revenue was up 1% sequentially as strong activity in the Middle East was partially able to offset the combination of continued weakness in Latin America and seasonal slowdowns in other parts of the world. In Latin America, revenue declined 4% sequentially driven by Mexico, where further budget constraints impacted activity and by Argentina where unfavorable weather conditions and continued union actions led to significant activity disruption. On the positive side, our integrated project activity in Ecuador remained strong and we saw as expected stronger conventional land drilling activity in Colombia as WTI oil prices climbed above $50. Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa decreased 2% sequentially due to the seasonal slowdown in activity in Norway and [Indiscernible] while activity in the rest of Russia and Europe as well as in North Africa was essentially flat. In sub-Saharan Africa revenue was marginally down due to anticipated project completions but we are now seeing a floor in activity and expect the recovery process to start in the coming quarters. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue increased 5% sequentially driven by strong drilling and completions activity on land in the Gulf region. At the same time activity in Asia weakened further in the fourth quarter, but now appears to have bottomed out and we therefore expect a slow recovery to start also here in the coming quarters. As we now move into the recovery part of the cycle, I would like to turn to the developing macro-environment and what this means for our business. First of all we maintain our constructive view of the oil market as supply and demand continued to tighten in the fourth quarter as demonstrated by the OECD oil stocks, which declined for the fourth month in a row in November. This tightening is partly driven by strong demand where the reporting agencies revised their global demand growth figures upwards in the fourth quarter, and now stand at around 1.5 million barrels per day in 2016 and between 1.3 and 1.6 million barrels per day in 2017. From the supply-side, non-OPEC production remains under pressure seen by the large year-over-year drop in North American production, which as of December had fallen by more than 600,000 barrels per day versus 2015. Over the same period new production from the completion of long-term large projects in Brazil, Kazakhstan and Russia was offset by falling production from Mexico, China and Colombia to result in a year-over-year reduction of 900,000 barrels per day for non-OPEC production. In terms of OPEC supply, production surged to record levels in the fourth quarter to meet the increase in demand and to offset the falling non-OPEC production. This lowered spare capacity down to 2 million barrels per day in November, which is barely 2% of global production represents a 12-year low. The OPEC agreement to reduce production by a significant volume of 1.6 to 1.8 million barrels per day has now established a floor to the oil prices and should accelerate the tightening of the oil market going forward. These supply reductions will take a few months to work their way through the distribution system, but we expect to see an acceleration of global stock floors towards the end of the first quarter. Meanwhile over the next several months, oil prices are expected to fluctuate around current levels until a steady reduction in crude inventories is fully established. As the up-cycle begins, growth in E&P investments will be led by the North America land operators who appear to remain unconstrained by years of negative free cash flow as external funding seems more readily available and the pursuit of shorter-term equity value takes precedence over a full cycle return. E&P spending surveys currently indicate that 2017 North America E&P investments will increase by around 30% led by the Permian basin, which should lead to both higher activity and a long overdue recovery in service industry pricing. In the international markets, the recovery will start slower driven by the constraints of the international E&P industry where the various operator groups determine their investment levels based on full cycle returns and their available free cash flow. At current oil price levels this will result in the third successive year of lower Capex spend, which will further weaken the state of the international production base. Over the past two years there has been very few [FID] approvals of new sizeable oil development and outside of the Gulf countries most of the international production is today depleting producible reserves with little or no reserves replacement. This is equivalent to borrowing barrels from the future. As a result, the activity and Capex required going forward to replenish reserves in order to uphold production for the medium to long term will be much higher than the current decline rates may suggest. This concerning trend cannot be reversed or mitigated by North America unconventional resources alone, which currently represents only around 5% of global crude production. The future supply challenges of the industry can only be addressed by a broad increase in global investment. Therefore as international E&P cash flow improves in the coming quarters we expect to see E&P investments accelerate in all main producing regions leading into 2018. So what does this macro-setting mean for Schlumberger? First we are very excited about our global opportunity set. Following nine consecutive quarters of relentless workforce reduction, cost cutting and restructuring efforts we are looking forward to restoring focus on the pursuit of growth and improved returns for our shareholders. And as outlined earlier we will launch our pursuit from a competitive platform that is even stronger than what it was a few years ago. In North America, our strategy during this downturn has been to preserve our infrastructure footprint on land, while reducing and stocking operating capacity to minimize financial losses during the trough of the cycle at the expense of market share. This has served us well in the past year. In parallel with this, we have continued to invest in the underlying efficiency of our operations as well as in new technologies and further vertical integration. As the market now starts to recover we will aggressively redeploy our ideal capacity in any product line and in any basin that shows a clear path towards profitability. This together with a strong market position of the Cameron product line will allow us to further expand the North America leadership position being held in recent years in terms of both margin and pre-tax operating income. Next, our international business is currently like a highly compressed coil spring. Activity levels in key market segments such as exploration and deep water are at record lows and although we do not expect a dramatic short term recovery the trends can only be positive from this point on. In terms of geography, it is worthwhile to note that the earnings contributions from key international markets like Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, Sub-Sahara Africa, China and Russia land have collectively dropped by more than 70% from Q4 of 2014 to Q4 of 2016, which by self represents a huge upside as the international recovery starts to unfold. In terms of our international operating capacity, the only way we have been able to protect cash flow and profitability in the international market has been to [Indiscernible] equipment and delay in major maintenance and repairs until the equipment is again needed. This means that we do not currently have any significant spare capacity available. Furthermore, given the major pricing concessions we have been forced to give, we have also had to reduce the technical support levels that we normally provide beyond our contractual obligations under both our operating assets and technical support towards customers who allow us to make a reasonable return. Going forward, however we can reactivate our equipment capacity and expand our support structure relatively quickly but we will only do so where it makes financial sense. In addition, we are now requesting pricing increases on contracts where the efforts we have made have helped bridge the trough of the cycle for our customers but where the contract holds no promise of delivering the returns we would expect in the current improving business environment. Over the past few years we have also expanded our addressable market by more than 50% with a series of acquisitions combined with internal R&E investment. Our offering now includes special control, drilling equipment, land rigs, infrastructure and surface processing facility. In addition, we have closed a number of new [STMB] and we continue to see a broad wing of this opportunity set given our integration capabilities, balance sheet strength and cash flow position. All of these new markets carry significant growth potential with unique technology, business models and integration opportunities that will facilitate both market share gains and improving returns for Schlumberger in the coming years. Furthermore, we are consistently able to convert our international market leadership into superior earnings generation as seen by our share of the top four service companies operating income which increased from 60% in 2014 to over 80% in the three first quarters of 2016. Another way to look at this is that for every dollar EMP spend spend in the international market we generate around four times the operating income of our closest competitor. This is due to our present operating scale and executional capabilities which together with our leverage towards the international market demonstrate the upstart we had in terms of earnings per share going forward. While earnings stores is a very important part of our financial performance full cycle cash generation is even more critical and here we continue to stand out in the wider industry. Over the past two years of this downturn we have generated $7.5 billion in free cash flow which is more than the rest of our competitors combined. Furthermore we have returned this entire month to our shareholders with dividends and share buyback. Finally, the breadth of our technology and integration offering together with our unmatched size and global footprint gives us an operating platform that enables us to support our customers in every corner of the world and through this capture more growth opportunities than any of our competitor. With this focus and ambition in mind, our management team and wider organization entered a new phase of the cycle with renewed energy and a spring in our [Indiscernible] fully resolved. Thank you.
Simon Farrant: Greg, we’ll now open up for Q&A
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey good morning, Paul.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, James.
James West: I thought you made some pretty compelling comments around the international side of your business near the coiled spring and also the reductions that you have seen in some major oil market which I was actually surprised to help big reductions that worked. It seems to me know though that you have better visibility at least on the international recovery and while stock markets may not be up year-over-year they will be up 4Q to 4Q 2017, could you perhaps touch on the visibility when you expect certain market to improve and if you have any views on the slope of the improvement that would be helpful as well?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I mean, I can give some general comments. Obviously, visibility for the full year of 2017 is still not all the way where we would like it to be. But what is fair is that the recovery is on unexplainable market and all markets have now reach the bottom including Sub-Sahara Africa and Asia, so I would say excluding the seasonal slowdown in Q1, it should be up from here in basically all markets, but the pace and the timing is still somewhat uncertain. Now, I think the key here is that we look at 2017 as a starting point of a new multiyear cycle, where the main challenge is actually going to be reverse the effect of several years of Global E&P underinvestment and then try to mitigate the pending supply shortage that we see unfolding. But the only way to achieve this is through broad-based increase in global E&P investments as North America and non-conventional production is not going to be able to address this pending supply issues by itself. So, in terms of how use of the markets are going to develop, the main thing we're doing now is we are preparing for a global recovery and we are really aiming at being ready to support our customers in every market around the world at these start to recover at varying point in time and at varying pace. So it’s a bit early to say exactly what’s going to happen in each one of them, but we are preparing and we are aiming to be ready as they kick in each one of them. I think the main thing I would commit to though is that we are basically aiming to drive earning growth as faster than our competitors in every market that we’re in. E&P spend and revenue is very important, but ultimately matters in the next phase is the ability to generate earnings and here we are very confident that we should to outperform our surroundings in every markets that we participate in including North America.
James West: Okay. Fair enough. And then, maybe a follow-up for Simon, the level of share repurchases has been lower than I would have expected here given the improving visibility, improving oil prices. Could you maybe comment on what level we should expect in the future, if you will be ramping that up, or if there's other investments that are more attractive like SPM or perhaps an M&A pipeline?
Simon Ayat: So, James, you’re right, its take a bit of a break on the buyback during the last few months. However if you look at our payout ratio including dividend, we are at a very high level. And we look at the situation by looking at our pre-cash flow generation and the opportunities ahead of us. I know that everyone think that we have some excess cash and we do as compared to historically, but we have a lot of opportunities that we see coming our way. In terms of projects, businesses and some strategic transactions, so 2017 in our opinion is going to provide a lot of these opportunities and we want to be ready to participate into them. As far as buyback we will always use excess to do buyback. And yes when the opportunity presents itself, we will accelerate this. But you can count on us continue to return to our shareholders a very significant part of the free cash flow and the operating cash flow, but we will, when the opportunity present itself accelerate the buyback.
James West: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.
Simon Ayat: Thanks, James.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Angie Sedita: So, Paal, maybe I could start off with SPM and you highlighted it in your comments and maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the opportunities you are seeing in the market as far as the type of opportunities and regions of the world that you are seeing some opportunities and just your long-term thoughts about the importance of SPM to Schlumberger?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think this is an opportunities that is continuing to expand. And we have – we’ve been in this market or been operating around these type of business models now for over a decade. We start off very slowly and we have accelerated in recent years as our capabilities have grown and has the opportunity that has also widen. Today, we are basically engaged in discussions and negotiations all around the world. We have around 20 countries that we are discussing SPM opportunities. There’s a range of the type of opportunities in terms of both size and resources, but I would say the general focus we have SPM is the mature fields oil on land, that’s main focus area. And if you look at the size of SPM today, it is a size of an average product line within the company and what we’ve said, which I’ll repeat is that I think over a reasonable amount of time I would say three to five years the growth potential is significant for SPM and I think it has the potential to grow from being a product line to becoming the size of the group. So a sign growth opportunity, but it is going to be something that will complement the rest of the company. Our base business in terms of the individual product lines for individual services and products is still going to be the lion share of what we provide to our customer.
Angie Sedita: Okay, great. Great, thanks, very helpful. And then you made some comments on U.S. pricing, so maybe you could talk a little bit about what you are thinking on the outlook for pricing for frac in the U.S. and is there any other pricing opportunities in the U.S., particularly directional drilling?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I would say, where we probably have had the most pricing traction is on directional drilling actually. So we – as I mentioned on the Q3 call we were already sold out on PowerDrive Orbit, our rotary steerable systems that we are deploying in them in U.S. land, and the trend of increasing lateral length which is further accelerating the uptake of this technology. So we were sold out at the end of Q3. We have added pretty significant capacity in Q4 and we’re still sold out. So this is the market segment that we’re actually see the biggest price increase and following on from that we’re also seeing a very good growth in both our drill bits business and the drilling fluid business. So that part we’re already performing quite well and so I’m pleased with that. On the fracing side, yes pricing is moving now, we need significantly more pricing before we are getting into I would say a sustainable operating environment, but that trend has been kicked off, we are actively high grading our contract portfolio, and we have active pricing discussions I would say with all customers at this stage, so that process has started and will continue in the coming quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer: Yes. Thank you. And thanks for the color on 2017. But I wonder whether it would be possible to help me a little bit on the bridge from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. There are some tricky seasonalities in Russia, North Sea and you also have positive seasonality in Canada and pricing momentum in North America land. So how should we think about the move from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, also taking into account the multi-client seismic seasonality and product sales?
Paal Kibsgaard: It’s a fair question, Ole. I think you hit on the main point that I would highlight as well. I mean the Q1 visibility is actually still somewhat limited. There are lot of moving parts including the main impact of the normal seasonal drop-in activity, right. Now with that you also have some positives which is not the growth in North America. So I’m not going to give you a specific number, but I would say that there is going to be the normal seasonal drop, but there are most I think factors as well which is a strong North America performance as well as probably less of a Q1 impact when it comes to the yearend sales that we’ve seen in previous years. So I’d so not ready to give you a number, but we are generally optimistic about the outlook for the coming year.
Ole Slorer: Okay. So consensus isn't entirely unreasonable?
Paal Kibsgaard: As I said I’m not going to give you a specific number.
Ole Slorer: Okay. Scott, I wonder if you could fill us in a little bit more on what you talked about and congrats with the first contract with Statoil. Just coming back from Europe, having met with a lot of the large oil companies over there, it sort of struck me to what extent the cost structure seems to be changing around at the moment. So could you give us a little bit of a view on what you think the cost structures that -- in the Bering Sea, we heard $40 and the well costs have dropped meaningfully as a result of headcount reduction on the rigs because of automation and remote drilling decision? So, how should we think about the cost structures and what are you hearing from your customers now? We also get a sense by the way that the cost structures have come down, at least from a cyclical standpoint, to a point where there is little room to squeeze more pricing out?
Scott Rowe: Yes. I think everybody knows that there is massive cost inflation in Deepwater projects, all through, basically from 2009 through 2013, and the industry became incredibly challenged in 2013 and 2014, so even before oil price collapse there is a massive cost issue. And I think operators across the world and both small and large, you really started to attack this problem in late 2013. And what I’ve seen in our discussions with our customers is there has been substantial movement here. And so, obviously it starts with the drilling rigs and the drilling contractors. I think everybody knows the status there and the oversupply has driven costs down substantially. But then on the infrastructure, right, the production systems and the installation of those, the [surfside] we’ve been able to through cost-reduction, standardization and simplification we’ve been able to get our pricing now back down to levels that we saw back in 2003 and 2004. I really feel comfortable that the price of developing deepwater projects is down substantially. And I think every basin and every reservoir is slightly different, so I’m not going to go into breakeven prices, but what we’re seeing on a regular basis is the ability to unlock developments that were there before. Now in that context what I’ll say is, mega projects of 60 plus wells that we saw before and billions and billions of dollars of capital on those projects are not super optimistic that we’re going to have lots of those as we look forward, but what we do feel is that by coming down into a more meaningful size call it between 10 and 20 wells I think operators are going to be able to do just fine there. And in the other market that we didn't mention was the tieback market and so we are seeing lots of activity on the Brownfield side we’re adding two wells and potentially a boosting system to that and really driving more production out of that existing field. So on most of optimistic about the Brownfield side, but what I would say is we’re seeing, we’re attracting a nice list of projects in that kind of 10 to 20 well development and we’ll see probably two -- at least two times the growth that we had in 2016.
Ole Slorer: Thanks for that clarification.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber. Please go ahead.
Paal Kibsgaard: Scott?
Operator: One moment please.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay, great. Let’s move to the next question.
Operator: Scott Gruber, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Can you hear me?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, we can, Scott.
Scott Gruber: Great. Scott, a question for you on Cameron. It's great to hear that you have line of sight on the bottom at the segment. Can you just provide some color on where revenues and margins could slip to in 1Q so we can dimension the starting point for future growth?
Scott Rowe: Yes. Like Paal said, we’re not giving hard numbers on Q1 guidance, but what I would say is the trend that you’re seeing over the last two quarters were probably on the top line continue in the Q1 and like I said in my prepared comments that we do think that is a low and our shorter cycle business of Valves & Measurement in Surface really start to capitalized on the increased activity in North America but also internationally. And we feel very good about driving growth both topline and bottom line from that going forward.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then I want to come back to the international line of questioning that James began with. Paal, I realize that the 2017 visibility is not perfect, but at a $55 Brent price and some momentum building over the course of the year, is it unreasonable to assume that we could see double-digit, year-on-year growth for the legacy Schlumberger productlines on the international front?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I again will go back to what I said earlier, I think it’s still early to commit the number. I think the current prices and billing of what Scott was saying in terms of several projects having seen, I would say significant cost reductions now. I think there is a basis for investing in the international market, and I think it’s going to be highly necessary in order to address the pending supply issues. And the main reason for the slower startup of international is just purely that investments are covered by free cash flow. So I would say that as soon as free cash flow starts to improve for the international operators we will see higher investments, exactly how fast that’s going to happen I think that’s the thing that is a bit difficult for us to predict. But the fact that they are good investment opportunities and that there is a need to invest, I think it’s both there. It just the matter of how quickly cash flow generation is going to allow this to happen.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Good morning. Hey, Scott, can you talk about the margin roadmap for 2017 for Cameron? You referenced that top line would bottom in Q1, but what is a reasonable expectation for a margin trough for Cameron?
Scott Rowe: Yes. And again, we’re not providing specific guidance on any other groups there are on where it goes, but I give some color in terms of how and what are the dynamics there and impacting it. So obviously we’ve been able to expand margins in the higher backlog businesses, right. So that was drilling and we saw a lot of those high margins come through in the first half of 2016, but now as that backlog fall it off, we’re still able to keep nice margins because we have the service business, right, so we’re getting parts in there and services which is historically been a higher margin. In turns the drilling business shifts to project -- from projects to more services which should be able deserve nice margins. OneSubsea throughout the cycle we’ve been able expand our margins and mostly that’s the pricing from 2012 to 2013 that’s coming through the system while we’re driving cost down. And so, OneSubsea margins will start to decline just because the pricing now is not what it was over the last three years. And so -- but we also believe that we can enhance bookings and do some things more creatively with the cost structure that keep relatively high margins in the OneSubsea business. And then for Valves & Measurement and Surface we should after Q1 start to see nice growth both on the top line and at the margin.
Bill Herbert: Right. So, I wasn’t actually asking for a level of margin, but basically wondering over the course of the year when should we expect to see sequentially improving margins for Cameron?
Paal Kibsgaard: You will see improvements from Q1 to Q2.
Bill Herbert: In margins?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes.
Bill Herbert: Okay, great. Thank you. And then Simon, it’s a question with regard to the ETR, you are guiding for sort of a bleeding higher of tax rates over the course of 2017, does that encompass the prospect of the bending lower of the U.S. Corporate tax rate?
Simon Ayat: Well to be honest, we’re not clear what will happen in the future for the corporate tax rate in North America. We hear what you hear that there will be a business friendly tax rate and we are looking forward to it, but no it does not include that kind of retakes, but our comment more relates to the mix of revenue, North America as you know it’s a higher tax rate than international. So once the business shifts to slightly better in North America we would experience higher tax rate and that’s the comment that we make.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Thank you.
Simon Ayat: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Muztafago from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.
Edward Muztafago: Hey guys, thanks. Question for Scott, just wondering maybe if we could delve a little bit more into the Q4 margin in Cam and specifically the downtick was pretty material, historically we have seen where large project shipments in Q4 can kind of cause some mix effects though maybe I’ll just ask directly if there were any mix effects in the quarter around would have expected maybe that given where margins are at with subsea and the fact that North America is improving that maybe that would have been a little stronger in Q4?
Robert Scott Rowe: Yes, mix was a big driver and you see that with the drilling backlogs. The drilling has always been one of our highest margin segments and as that backlog comes down it definitely has a major impact. And the backlog has deteriorated pretty substantially there in the back half of 2016. So that was the biggest movement all of the say and Q3, one Subsea had its highest margin ever, which we knew were not necessarily sustainable from that very lofty peak. And so that’s now come down still in the very high, in the very high levels but it did come off the peak. And then on the surface and the V&M businesses where we’ve been able to maintain the margins throughout 2016 and now as we start to grow we need to leverage the revenue growth, but at the same time growing environments we are starting to add people and resources that we are very focused on the profitability as we go forward.
Edward Muztafago: Okay, that’s helpful. So it’s a typically high margins in 3Q that came down plus the mix and a little bit of perhaps lag in the margin improvement and in some of the shorter cycle businesses.
Robert Scott Rowe: I mean that will give...
Edward Muztafago: Okay, great, great. And then Paal, really like the spring comment in the international markets, so perhaps we could focus on maybe just one spring in the watch in that Latin America, you have a couple of markets there Ecuador, Argentina, Colombia really operating at very depressed level and historically if we look back at least at the peak anyway won’t there historically Latin America was probably 30% of global land rig account, can you talk about the evolution perhaps of the Latin American land rig market, the land market over the next say 12 months to 24 months?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I would just generally say that if you look at current activity levels, it will come up from where we are today. I think the best example to illustrate this is probably Colombia, where we’ve always maintained that if WTI breaks $50 in a positive direction that should yield a significant increase in land rigs or in overall rig activity. So, actually in the fourth quarter when this oil price event occurred, we almost immediately saw a significant uptick in rig activity in Colombia and we’ve seen actually a dramatic surge in activity in the country over the past few months. I think this is an early indication then you would see similar things happening potentially in Mexico and in Argentina as well. Ecuador for us has been strong throughout the downturn driven by the activity on our integrated projects and Venezuela in terms of activity obviously there is significant potential activity there and the reactivation of the business there is purely going to come down to the ability of getting paid. So as I would say that we are the [Indiscernible] there is an early indication of what potentially will occur coming from Colombia and in term of the other land markets I think we’ll follow soon as soon as there is more cash flow available.
Edward Muztafago: So could you see Latin America being or a scenario where Latin America is perhaps the surprise market for 2017, or is that perhaps a little bit longer turn in your mind?
Paal Kibsgaard: No actually I think all parts of the international market has the potential to surprise. I think it is indeed a highly compressed Cold Spring, where it’s going to break out first. I think it’s still kind of offer discussion right. We have a very very solid base line business coming out of Russia as well as the GCC part of the Middle East and I think all other businesses are extremely depressed in terms of activity levels and we expect several of them to show growth and come out of this environment due in the course of 2017 leading into 2018, but exactly which one is going to come first I think it’s a dual effect.
Edward Muztafago: Okay, thanks appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
Bill Sanchez: Thanks, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Bill Sanchez: So Paal your comments with regard to international capacity here and the fact effectively you have no spare capacity. If I look at the CapEx guide for this year, it would suggest that relatively flat with 2016. You don't have much of any expectation I'm guessing in activating currently stacked capacity internationally, I guess number one. And number two, what would be the trigger point on your comment for redeploying assets out of North America I guess if returns ultimately weren't suitable for you and what markets most likely will we see those assets venture to?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I think if you look at the CapEx guidance it’s more or less flat with the 2016 and this has been only around 50% of D&A, right. So it’s still low as you indicate. Now, we have two transformation program a continued focus on driving assets utilization from the existing capacity that we have and actually the cost of reactivating the international capacity is not significant. We are just saying that we aren’t going to incur the cost unless there is an adequate financial return, but we can do it pretty fast. It is not exceptive in terms of CapEx investments and a fair bit of this is built into the number that we are guiding to for 2017. So in terms of capturing upside growth I think we can capture quite a lot of upside growth even within this CapEx number that we are guiding fee. And when it comes to the potential redeployment capacity there is nothing unique about North America offshore or anything, the only thing we are saying is that we will constantly look at what kind of returns we are getting in the contract that we operate in and some of the high end assets they are quite expensive and they are in potentially high demand and we will continue to look at deploying them where we can get the best return. So the redeployment comment was around the offshore business which we have I would say quite limited spare capacity of some of the high end technologies and if we aren’t getting the adequate returns in any part of the world, we will look to shift it around to where we can get the return.
Bill Sanchez: Okay. Appreciate the clarification there. I know there has been a lot of questions around top line and thoughts on international. Just curious on prior thoughts around the incremental margins. Paal, you have talked about 65% I think ex-Cameron as being a reasonable incremental assumption. As you see now being able to enter the conversations with your customers on claw backs of these pricing concessions, and I think just your overall outlook, is that still a fair type of incremental margin we should be thinking about 2017 versus 2016?
Paal Kibsgaard: While we stand behind that number that we were given. I think in order for that number to be achieved I think we need to get into a kind of a steady line of growth which I think will happen during the course of 2017. It might not be for the full year of 2017. And in addition to that we will need some pricing contribution to that right. So, the 65% incremental as we stand behind and we need to get kind of through the trough which we are basically done with now and it’s just a matter of how we manage this going forward, but we are committed to the number and that’s what we are going to aim to do going forward.
Bill Sanchez: I appreciate the time. I will turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And we have time for one last question. Your final question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Timna Tanners: Yes, hey Happy Friday everyone.
Paal Kibsgaard: Hey, good morning.
Timna Tanners: I just had a quick follow-up with some comments that Simon made earlier. Wanted to know, given that you were making comments about having hit the trough and on an upturn in general for businesses, including international, how do we think about any further cost-cutting. It's been a big positive for the Company having been able to contain margins very well and better than peers, but do we continue to model further cost cutting measures or should we consider ourselves in the final innings there?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well you have seen that we have taken some charges here for further rationalization of our support structure. This is obviously we’ll have a full year impact. Now some of the cost cutting measures that we have taken including our transformation program will have a full year effect in 2017. You will continue to see the management of cost and the cost control that will be ongoing in the company, but as far as the concerned, there is no further action beyond what we have taken, but it will have a full year impact.
Timna Tanners: Okay. So no further large cost cutting measures that we should anticipate at current market conditions?
Paal Kibsgaard: No. Not as far as we are concerned now and based on what we have seen we have taken a chance to further rationalize which will be implemented in the first quarter and it’s already underway but there will be no further cut.
Timna Tanners: Got you. And then finally on the follow-up to the commentary about considering exiting contracts or regions that failed to provide an adequate return, I was just curious, can you characterize how some of your competitors behaviors are in those same markets and talk to us about what timeframe you might need to make a decision on whether or not you will continue in less-competitive markets?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I think all parts of the business, North America land, all of international, North America offshore, it’s as usual very competitive. Now there are 15 trends in where pricing is going and generally I would say that there is more focus now I think generally in industry to try to raise prices but it is highly competitive and it’s kind of we take this from bid to bid in terms of how we play this, right. But the behavior from our competitors there is nothing special around that. I think they are challenged similar to us in terms of pricing and profitability levels and we’re coming off a phase of the cycle which has been extremely demanding for old players. I think the – these are actions that we all wanted to go is that we need to recover some of the pricing concessions that we have given, but again this is highly competitive and it’s a bit difficult to provide general comments, because every bit that we submitted is highly competitive and we are all trying to win them.
Timna Tanners: That’s it. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: All right. So before we close this morning, I’d like to summarize the key points that we’ve discussed. First, the market recovery is clearly on its way and we look at 2017 as the starting point of a new multi year cycle that will require a broad based increase in E&P investment in order to reverse the effect of several years of global under investment and mitigate the pending supply shortage. As all cycle will initially be led by North America land, but followed by the international markets later in 2017 and leading into 2018. And while E&P spend and revenue is very important what ultimately matters in the next phase is the ability to drive earnings growth and we commit to delivering faster earnings growth than our competitors in all of the markets we compete in including North America. We have a proven track record of doing just that and our 600 business units spanning the globe are all ready, able and incentivized to deliver on this promise. So after nine quarters of cost cutting and restructuring we are very excited about resuming focus on growth and improving returns for our shareholders. Thank you for participating.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-10-21 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Simon Farrant - VP IR Simon Ayat - EVP & CFO Robert Scott Rowe - President, Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & CEO
Analysts: James West - Evercore ISI Angie Sedita - UBS Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley Scott Gruber - Citigroup Bill Herbert - Simmons David Anderson - Barclays Kurt Hallead - RBC James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Sean Meakim - JPMorgan
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2016 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York following the Schlumberger Limited Board Meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Rowe, President, Cameron Group. Scott will join the earnings call through the fourth quarter of this year to provide an update on the Cameron Group business, integration and synergies. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon, Scott and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, then Scott will provide the Cameron update, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our third quarter press release, which is posted on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. I'll now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter we recorded $237 million of pretax merger and integration charges, associated with the acquisition of Cameron. This consisted of $149 million non-cash inventory purchase accounting item that will not recur. The balance relates to transaction costs as well as a dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. Our third quarter revenue of $7 billion decreased 2% sequentially. This decrease was entirely driven by reduced activity in the Cameron Group due to its declining backlog. Excluding the impact of Cameron Group, third quarter revenue actually increased 1% sequentially. Pretax operating margins increased 119 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Margins increased sequentially in each group except for Cameron. These increases reflect the benefits from cost reduction initiatives as well as the effects of last quarter's itemized asset write-downs, which contributed to approximately 50% of the reduction in depreciation. Operational highlights by product group were as follows; third quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% sequentially, while margin increased 292 basis points to 19.1%. The revenue growth was primarily driven by increased testing services and WesternGeco activities. Margins improved sequentially across all reservoir characterization technologies, but most noticeably in wireline and testing services. Drilling group revenue of $2 billion was essentially flat sequentially, while margins increased by 241 basis points. The margin expansion was largely due to the benefit of cost initiatives and reduced losses in Venezuela due to further alignment of our resources in the market to match the reduced level of activity. Production group revenue of $2.1 billion was also essentially flat sequentially while margin improved 41 basis points, largely due to strong SPM activity. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the 12% reduction in revenue, pretax operating margin only declined 34 basis points to 16%. The revenue decline was driven by the decrease in backlog that has significantly impacted the drilling group line. However, strong project execution and OneSubsea combined was cost control initiatives across the Group limited the margin decline. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 16% in the third quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Gounf forward, our tax rate will be driven by the overall geographic mix of earnings. During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first three quarters of 2016, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $117 million during the third quarter and paying $800 million of severance and one one-off Cameron related transaction payments during the first nine months of the year. Our net debt increased $122 million during the quarter to $10.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $11.1 billion. During the quarter we spend $156 million to repurchase two million shares at an average price of $77. On a year-to-date basis, we had spend $662 million to repurchase 9.5 million shares at an average price of $69.64 per share. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $400 million on CapEx, $140 million on SPM investments, $160 million of multi-client and $700 million of dividend payments. Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1.4 billion, which includes two quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the full year of 2016 is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. These amounts do not include SPM or multi-client. And now I'll turn the conference call over to Scott.
Robert Scott Rowe: Hello everyone. I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group, now they were six months into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continued to have good operating results in the third quarter, despite the challenges in the global marketplace and the contraction of our backlog driven by this prolonged downturn. In Q3, our revenue reduced by 12% sequentially to $1.3 billion. Despite this drop, we were able to successfully hold operating margins at 16% which is 19% decremental of a nearly all time high margin performance in the second quarter of this year. The higher margins are a result of relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project execution in our longer cycle businesses. We've now experienced seven straight quarters of reduced activity and pricing pressure in the marketplace and Cameron shorter cycle service and balance of measurement businesses have experienced a full effect of reduced activity, spending cuts and pricing pressure, but are now positioned to rebound with any incremental activity. Despite the duration of the downturn, these two businesses continue to be profitable and have strong cash flow as we've managed our cost structure and working capital well throughout the cycle. Typical lead times in these businesses range from three weeks to nine months and we expect to see revenue flattening future quarters and begin to grow again in mid 2017 as onshore activity picks up around the world. In our longer cycle businesses, OneSubsea Drilling Systems, we've been extremely successful in expanding margins throughout the cycle. OneSubsea and drilling remain accretive to the overall margins of the Cameron Group. In fact OneSubsea had record profitability at 23.5% this quarter. The profitability improvements and the market share gains over the last two years validate the vision we had when we created OneSubsea. The drilling at OneSubsea teams have done an excellent job improving our project delivery processes, driving cost out of projects and products and capitalizing on our installed base by expanding our service and aftermarket offering. Going forward these improvements will be partly offset by extremely competitive pricing and lower volumes. These two businesses are now entering a period of revenue decline as our backlog has fallen for seven straight quarters. We are now entering the base of the downturn that the other Schlumberger businesses have experienced over the past 18 months. On a brighter note, our book-to-bill ratio for these two businesses was 0.8 in the third quarter, which was highest ratio we have seen since the downturn began. This gives us visibility to revenue growth in 2018. The drilling systems business will contract the most as new equipment orders for floating and jack-up rates are nearly non-existent and our focus has now shifted to land rigs and capitalizing on our market-leading installed base of pressure control equipment. Before I transition to the integration, I want to spend a minute on how we're positioning OneSubsea. We now have eight paid studies and we're working on 30 customer engagements on our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance. I fully expect to win a small award that utilizes OneSubsea's equipment and Subsea 7 installation capability before the year is over. We see the market as an area of growth in the deepwater sector. Operators are looking to spend significantly less and drive higher returns by capitalizing on existing host facilities. OneSubsea is uniquely positioned with our standardized Subsea Tree, our single well boosting system, our unified control system and our partnership with Subsea 7 to capitalize on this growth opportunity. We also have the capability to integrate this further with the deepwater drilling and production teams at Schlumberger to provide further turnkey solutions to operators who are looking to tie back these assets. The success of the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger continues to exceed our expectations. I would like to confirm that the transaction is again accretive in the third quarter as well as confirm that we will achieve the $300 million synergy target in the first year of the combination. In the third quarter we booked $139 million of synergy-related work, which landed in every business segment in the Cameron Group. One notable award in the quarter was an integrated project for Chevron in Thailand that consisted of surface wellheads and trees, wireline logging services, M-I SWACO drilling fluids and services as well as the supply of barite. This is a great example of subsurface and service integration across three different Schlumberger groups. While there is still more cost savings to be had, our integration will shift focus to driving revenue synergies and capitalizing on the vast geographic network of Schlumberger. We see significant growth opportunities for Cameron in the Middle East, Russia, Latin America and India where Cameron can leverage the substantial presence and relationships that Schlumberger has in these geographies. In summary, I could not be more pleased with how our group is performing in the down cycle and how we're capitalizing on the opportunities that the combination of Schlumberger and Cameron has created. I'll now turn it over to Bob.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. After seven quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have indeed reached the bottom of the cycle. Our third-quarter revenue still decreased 2% sequentially, but this was largely driven by the anticipated reduction in activity at Cameron, as the product backlog continued to decline. Excluding Cameron, revenue increased 1% sequentially, driven by higher activity in North America land, Middle East, Russia and Australia. Since the start of this downturn and added deepening to uncharted territory, our entire management team has worked relentlessly to protect the financial strength of the company. This includes carefully navigating the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share and also by proactively removing a staggering $6 billion of quarterly costs through headcount reductions internal efficiency improvements and strong supply chain management. This has enabled us to deliver unmatched financial results by maintaining pretax operating margins well above 10% and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic CapEx investments as well as our ongoing dividend commitments. We continue to carry forward a strong financial focus as seen in our third quarter results where we delivered 19% decremental margins in the Cameron Group and incremental margins north of 65% for the other three groups combined, excluding any tailwind from previous impairment charges. These results which represents a small step on our path towards first restoring and subsequently exceeding our pre-downturn earnings per share and financial returns are mostly driven by internal cost and efficiency improvements, with so far only a minor impact from price increases and high grading of our contract portfolio. Going forward is critical for us to recover the large pricing concessions we have made over the past two years to allow us to restore investment levels in technology innovation, system integration and operational quality and efficiency, which are all key enablers of our customer's project performance. As indicated in July, we have during this quarter started pricing recovery discussions with a large part of our global customer base, while there is a general understanding from our customers that pricing will have to increase, there were no material movements during the quarter, but with the recent increase in oil prices, the basis for these discussions has now strengthened. Looking forward to the activity recovery phase, we will only allocate investments, operating capacity and expertise to contracts and basins that meet our financial return expectations, in the same way our customers allocate capital to projects in their portfolios. Currently a noticeable part of our contracts do not meet these financial return criteria and this is our starting point for reestablishing sustainable customer relationships that will warrant allocation of our capital capacity and expertise. In addition to our focus on pricing recovery, we will in the coming quarters also aim to restore proper payment schedules from our customers in line with the terms and conditions in our contracts to address the payment delays we today are seeing from many customers around the world. Still in spite of these payment delays, free cash flow generation in the third quarter remained solid at $700 million as inventory and CapEx investments was again tightly managed. Next I'll review the third quarter trends from our geographical operations and I will focus my comments on the Characterization Drilling $ Production Groups as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group. In North America, revenue for the Characterization Drilling & Production Groups increased 3% sequentially as solid growth on land was largely offset by a further revenue reduction in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Eastern Canada impacting all product groups. The strong growth on land was driven by the U.S. with acute rig count increased significantly and with more than half of the rigs being added in the Permian Basin. The increased drilling activity is reflected in our drilling and measurements pipeline, which posted 31% revenue growth in U.S. land compared to the second quarter. At this stage we're seeing a growing trend in U.S. land to what's even longer horizontal laterals or super laterals aiming at further increasing reservoir contacts. One example of this is a well we drilled for Eclipse Resources with a because purchase resources with a record lateral length of 18,500 feet using our industry-leading PowerDrive vorteX rotary steerable system. This emerging trend has already created a significant increase in the uptake of our high-end drilling technologies and has also provided our drilling group with a clear path towards profitability on land. We've therefore shifted focus from maintaining presence to now gaining market share for our drilling business in North America land. In the hydraulic fracturing market, the stage count increased by 17% sequentially, driven by higher activity and also by customers now actively depleting their duct well inventory. Still the fracturing market continues to be completely commoditized and significantly oversupplied with a large number of very hungry players. In addition, the significant increase in sand volume pumper stage is already starting to create inflation on both product and distribution costs, which will further obstruct and delay the hydraulic fracturing industry's path towards restoring profitability. Today the North America fracturing business continues to be highly dilutive to our financial performance and this combined with a short term market outlook means that we have not yet shifted focus towards gaining market share. Instead we continue to maintain our market presence while further concentrating activity around our core operating areas. Still we continue to monitor the fracturing market closely and we're ready to deploy our significant stacked capacity on short notice, but only when the market environment can support positive contributions. While this trend is very encouraging, I would like to stress that these new contract models are only an addition to our offering and that we will continue to actively pursue traditional models for customers who prefers this type of engagement. As we now look to further capitalize on these emerging trends in the international market, we have two major advantages. First, our unmatched scale in terms of people, equipment and infrastructure, which allow us to quickly adjust to the increasing technical complexity and additional demand from our customers, while ensuring safe and consistent quality in our operations and second by having been present in all parts of the world for the past 80 to 90 years, we have established deep industry relationships and unprecedented local credibility, which makes us an natural partner to explore new contract models and translate these into successful business relationships. With that, let's take a closer look at the trends we're seeing in the three international operating areas. In Latin America, the combined revenue for the Characterization Drilling & Production Groups declined by 5% sequentially due to continued reductions in EMP spend and activity throughout the regions. However the two year activity slide was clearly slowing during the quarter and we believe we have now reached the bottom of the cycle also in Latin America. The sequential revenue drop came entirely from the drilling and production groups while the Characterization group posted a 2% increase, driven by solid multi-client seismic sales in Mexico. Here WesternGeco our 80,000 square kilometers of marine surveys in the prime deep water acreage that will be included in the upcoming bid rounds was the first taking place December 5 of this year. In Mexico, our drilling activity is also expected to pick up in early parts of 2017, driven by both PAMAX and the successful players from the shallow water big grounds that has already taken place. In Ecuador, activity remained solid driven by our SPM projects and we continue to progress in line with our fee development plans, both with respect to work scope and production levels. As for in the regions, activity remained subdued due to severe budget constraints for most customers, however we are seeing early signs of recovery in several countries. In Argentina there is clear optimism amongst the industry players that the new government will take the required steps to further encourage E&P investment in the country as they seek to reduce the oil import dependency, which should have a positive impact on E&P investments in 2017. In Brazil, Petrobras continues to focus on arresting the decline in the mature Campos Basin and is considering opening up for a new and more commercially aligned business models with the service industry which could include feet per barrel contract. In Venezuela our operations remained largely shut down on site work we do for the IOC JVs in the Faja. However, we are in discussions with PDVSA on a new contract model, which will include a payment assurance mechanism and we are optimistic that this contract will be finalized in the coming months and that operations could start in Q1. And in Columbia, with oil prices around $50, activity is expected to increase in the coming quarters at Ecopetrol and several other players are preparing for offshore drilling campaigns in 2017. Revenue in Europe, CIS, and Africa declined 3% sequentially excluding the Cameron Group while strong sequential growth in Russia and flat activity in the North Sea and North Africa was more than offset by a further reduction in activity throughout sub-Sahara Africa. The drop in revenue was driven by the drilling and production groups, while the characterization group posted solid sequential growth. A large part of the growth in the characterization group came from Russia as summer season activity peaked both on land and offshore and with revenue growth further supported by a stronger Ruble. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal seasonal slowdown in Russia due to winter weather while the outlook for 2017 activity continues to be strong. The North Sea posted sharp sequential revenue following a solid summer season where activity in Norway was particularly strong. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal decline in activity as summer projects conclude and winter weather sets in. Still expiration success in Norway and several large project startups indicate stronger 2017 activity in the North Sea. Revenue in continental Europe was up 19% sequentially on strong integrated project performance and deep water exploration activity in Bulgaria. Higher oil prices will lead to increased production-related activity in this region with a 5% rig count increase expected in Q4, further supported by the restart of offshore activity in the East and Med in the early parts of 2017. North Africa activity remained stable with strong revenue sequentially, while we expect moderate growth in activity in Q4 partly supported by increased market share from recent tender wins for tracks. The market challenges in sub-Sahara and Africa continued in Q3 with yet another significant drop in activity and with the rig count now down by 75% compared to Q4 2014. However with this latest drop, we do believe we have reached the bottom of the cycle also in this region and expect modest activity increases in most countries in Q4 with the exception of Angola. In the Middle East and Asia, Characterization, Drilling and Production Group revenue grew 2% sequentially as strength in the Middle East and Australia was partly offset by continued weakness in Asia. Both the Characterization and Drilling groups posted grow in the third quarter, while production group revenue was slightly down due to a temporary reduction in fracturing activity in the Middle East. In the GCC, the underlying, drilling and rig-less activity remained strong with solid revenues reported in all countries. In addition to this, we continue to progress on our early production facility project in Kuwait which represents another exciting growth opportunity for us. In Australia, our revenue increased in the third quarter after seven quarters of decline driven by additional land activity for the drilling group as well as higher offshore exploration activity for the Characterization Group. While in China, Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia, the revenue decline continued in the third quarter and at present, there are no signs of any imminent activity recovery in this region. Turning now to the oil macro, the supply and demand of crude is now more or less in balance as seen by the flattening global petroleum inventories and the start of consistent growth towards the end of the quarter in particular in North America. In addition, oil demand was again revised upwards in September and is now forecasted to be around 1.2 million barrels per day for both 2016 and 2017. At the same time global supply is plateauing as non-OPEC production continues to experience significant declines and even offsetting record production levels from OPEC in September. Based on current investment levels, we believe that 2017 non-OPEC production will at best be flat and any production outside from the U.S., Canada and Brazil will be offset by further declines in the rest of the global production base. Given the projected demand growth, this means that the call on OPEC will increase from the current record production levels, suggesting that the production outside from Nigeria, Libya and Iran may be needed to keep the markets in balance. All of this means that the period of oversupply and inventory build is over and that market segments should soon change, paving the way for an increase in oil prices and subsequently E&P investments. There is also a case to be made for a more rapid role on the global oil inventories and a more bullish outlook for the oil price in the event of a lower production upside from Libya, Nigeria and Iran OPEC and Russia implementation of production cuts for a steeper decline in non-OPEC production. In terms of the 2017 E&P investments, details are still limited. However we maintain that a V-shaped recovery is unlikely given the fragile financial state of the industry. Still we do see upsides in 2017 in North America land, the Middle East and Russia and we are making sure, we are optimally placed to capture a large share of this upside and importantly turn this additional activity into positive earnings contributions. With the unparalleled cost and cash discipline we have established, we are confident in our ability to deliver incremental margins North of 65% and a free cash flow conversion rate above 75%, which going forward will give a significant flexibility to both reinvest in our business as well as thoroughly return cash to our shareholders. Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
James West: Hey, good morning, Paal. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, James.
James West: Paal, you talked a lot in recent quarters about the need for increased industry collaboration and it looked to me going through the press release that you cited a number of examples, of course ISM projects, but also projects that looked to me that signal more collaboration, is that catching on, on a global basis.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I think we are seeing a growing interest in this. It varies a little bit amongst the different customer groups. But I would say overall, there is a growing trend of a desire to collaborate closer and also to implement more commercially aligned business models, which I alluded to in my prepared remarks. This goes all the way from the basic models linked to either time of production for a well, all the way up to fulfill management around the SPM concept. 
James West: Got you. And then one market where we haven't seen a lot of collaboration historically has been the U.S. land market, but you highlighted I think three or four different, different wins there. Could you talk, I know you talked a little bit about the evolving, super laterals in North America, but could you talk about the collaboration in North America, what you're seeing there and what the next steps are if that collaboration could lead to more technology improvements, technology advancements and use in North America.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes we cited a few of these examples in the press release. So we are seeing -- we are seeing signs of that taking place in North America land as well, but I would say on a percentage basis is obviously a lot lower returns than what we have internationally, but it’s still encouraging to see stronger collaboration, both on the drilling side linked to drilling more complex wells at the super laterals. As well as on the production and completion side around how we optimize completions using information evaluation and a bit more sophisticated approach to fracing. So we are seeing it happening, but still in fairness it's a fairly small part of the business volume, but these technology opportunities both in the drilling side and on the completion side is really why we are in this market. We're not in it for the commodity side of it. We believe that ultimately technology will play an even larger role in the North America land markets and we continue to promote these capabilities and this part of our offering because we ultimately believe it's going to bring a lot more value for our customers.
James West: Yes. Thanks Paal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning, guys. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Angie Sedita: So Paal as a follow-up to James' question, so the SPM certainly are growing market and important Schlumberger overall. So could you talk a little bit about where you're seeing the investment opportunities and the pipeline of opportunities over the next one to two years? I assume that's growing and are you seeing an increasing number of IOCs that want to partner up with Schlumberger on some of these projects?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, for SPM we are seeing I would say a significantly growing interest across all customer groups. So far in terms of the discussions that are most advanced I would say are generally with the -- with the NOCs and the independence and even start-up companies, but we have -- we've had -- we have had discussions with IOCs on this contract model as well. But in terms of the opportunity set it is, it is growing and it's very significant. And as I quoted in my prepared remarks, we are today engaged in various stages of discussions in 20 countries around the world covering all the four operating areas. So while this used to be -- this model used to be contained to a handful of countries, we today see a rapid expansion of the interest and we have obviously staffed up significantly in our SPM product line to make sure that we can pursue all these opportunities, turn them into projects and subsequently execute the projects in line with our plans, but it's a significant growth opportunity and something that we are actively pursuing in all four operating areas.
Angie Sedita: All right, all right, fair enough. And then on the international side, you talked about the price concessions and some of them are oil-based triggers and some time based and so does it happen as you hear a certain oil price or there is time bound concession that initially it moves into play or you have a conversation first with these NOCs and how much of this do you think will actually be returned to demand?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, the whole discussion around pricing, first of all is going to take a little bit of time. We indicated in July that we are firmly putting this on the agenda and we have done so in the third quarter. We've had engagement and discussions with most customers around the world. I think there is -- there is a general acceptance from the customer base that ultimately prices are going to have to come up. Not a lot of movement as we expected in the third quarter, but I would say, given the increase we've seen in oil prices over the past month or so and the potential trajectory, we could see going forward, I think there is much stronger basis for having these discussions at this stage. And then we will discussions individually with our customers depending on the contract, the model and the contract situation we have with them. It could be at some states that some of these contracts will be -- will be rebid and if that's so, then we will obviously participate in that. But I think in many cases there is room to negotiate within the existing contract framework to come into I would say mutually agreeable solution, which will be acceptable both for us and for our customers.
Angie Sedita: All right. Thanks. I’ll turn it over.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks Angie.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Ole.
Ole Slorer: Yes morning, morning. So let’s get back to West Texas again, you highlighted that you see growth in Middle East, in Russia and in North America land, Middle East and Russia, you clearly very well associated to that, maybe North America land, not so much. So you talked about -- so how do you first of all see your positioning and you talked about mobilizing equipment in big ability to drill longer laterals, can you talk a little bit about pricing and tightness and how you get paid for this mobilization.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, what we're mobilizing are drilling tools, which isn't excessively expensive right. So we do that and we also will take some for manufacturing and this is all manufactured in the -- or partly manufactured in the U.S. as well. So in terms of the reason for mobilizing more equipment into the drilling side is clearly that we have a clear path towards profitability. So given the unique technology offering we have and the technical challenges of drilling these very, very long horizontals we are able to get pricing which is going to give us I think ultimately the returns that we're looking for. And this is why we are prepared to put more capacity into play on the drilling side or what's going on in West Texas. As I said on the fracturing side, still there is no clear path towards profitability and this is why we are still maintaining presence and basically holding the fort until we believe we can justify putting more capacity into play going forward.
Ole Slorer: Thanks for that. And if we look at 2017, when you've heard out of oil in London companies like Total talked very aggressively about stepping up activity next year, taking advantage of low oilfield services costs others like BP have been very vocal also of getting going, yet you highlight Russia and Middle East areas where these companies I think all these type of companies are typically not all that active. So does this mean that you have a different view or you don't believe that's kind of the type of IOC will step it up or is that they're coming from a very low base at the end of the year and sequentially will be improving from here but year-over-year be kind of flat. Could you help us a little bit with making sense of some of those statements?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, as I was trying to cover in the fairly detailed description I gave of the international markets, we believe that there is early signs of recovery in most places around the world. If you look at next year for international, we expect solid growth year-over-year in the Middle East and Russia on a full year basis. But we also see, I would say an uptick in investment and activity in Latin America and in Europe, Africa. The only place where we don't see any signs of recovery at this stage is in Asia. But I would say the uptick in Latin America and Europe, Africa, is more going to be from current Q3 activity levels. It might not be a significant increase on a full-year basis, but I think we have reached bottom in both of those regions, which would warrant higher activity. So I'm not contradicting what the IOCs are saying and we welcome obviously more activity and higher investments from them. It's just that the main very clear investment increases we are seeing are still going to be in Russia and the Middle East, but our early signs of things picking up from bottom also in the rest of the world excluding Asia.
Ole Slorer: Okay. Thanks for clarifying Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks Ole.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Good
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: Question for Scott, you highlighted the Point 8 book to bill, which I believe was for OneSubsea that this foreshadowed growth into 2018. The shorter cycle businesses though at Cameron should be expanding at this point as well at least that forecast. However, when I look back at a recent investor presentation, case for Cameron revenue in 2018 is actually flat and the midpoint looks like it was down a bit. Has the outlook for Cameron now improved, is there a line of sight to growth in 2018 assuming the short cycle businesses came over the course of 2017.
Robert Scott Rowe: Yes, thanks for the question on Cameron. Just to clarify right, we are in the earnings press release, we're giving the OneSubsea and the drilling bookings and backlog and what you can see there is on the book to bill, the point 8 was meant to be for both drilling systems and OneSubsea. So actually OneSubsea is higher than that and we're just below one on the OneSubsea side. But on 2018 general guidance for revenue and growth for the Cameron Group it really depends on those short cycle businesses and win activity returns and so there is a path for growth in '18, but it depends on that land business in Vietnam and in the services segment. We're highly focused on growing in the Middle East. We’re highly focused are growing in Midcontinent there in the United States and if we can see continued rig count increase, then we do have a path for growth. Now obviously, the drilling business with the backlog numbers there will continue to decline and OneSubsea quite frankly has been relatively flat since the beginning of the deepwater downturn, which started in 2014, and so we will lose a lot of revenue traction on OneSubsea. It will really come from drilling and then the offset is the shorter cycle business growth on the land markets.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And an unrelated follow-up on the expanding opportunity in SPM. There's been a willingness to take on some oil price risk in SPM and link at least certain number of payments to oil price. Paal, can you shed some color on just what percentage of the SPM portfolio as in oil price linkage now and where you would be comfortable taking that percentage over time.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well if you look in our contract structure today, I would say the lion's share of this is basically a fee per barrel, which is obviously the project has a link to the oil price, but our compensation is generally linked to the incremental production times of 60 per barrel. Now at this stage at the bottom of the cycle, we are in some cases considering a share production times the oil price rather than the fee per barrel the times the entire incremental production. But as based on individual projects, but I would say the portfolio as it stands today is generally fee per barrel not directly exposed oil price, but we are considering some of the -- in some of the cases today to take a bit more oil price risk. If we can make the project work at current oil prices, we are fairly comfortable opening up and balancing the portfolio a bit with a bit more oil price risk.
Scott Gruber: Will it always remain a minority of the book?
Paal Kibsgaard: I would say generally that would be the philosophy, yes.
Scott Gruber: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead
Bill Herbert: Thank you. Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Bill. 
Bill Herbert: Yes. So SPM, back to SPM, sorry Paal at this stage, do you think SPM investments in 2017 are going to be up over 2016 which has been a fairly big year? 
Paal Kibsgaard: Sorry, I couldn't hear what was going to be up? 
Bill Herbert: SPM, the question is whether your capital investment in SPM in 2017 is going to be up over 2016 which is thus far been a pretty big year?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think it is too early to say. I would say as a starting point, I would say probably not maybe, maybe somewhat in line, but I think it's going to depend on the opportunities that we have in front of us. Obviously there is a broad range of discussions. I think for the right opportunities I'm prepared to invest more into it, but I think we will have to do that on a case by case basis.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And then secondly, at this stage given your outlook for global E&P CapEx, which frankly sales more constructive than I was expecting, which is good, do you think that Schlumberger's revenues in 2017 overall are going to be up?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, it's a bit early to say. We're still in Q3. The absolute E&P investment numbers for next year, I think it's still early to comment on absolute numbers.
Bill Herbert: Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard: I can give you some direction and I think in terms of revenue, see the trends going and what the absolute number is going to be, is going to be more a function of how the numeric of these trends play out, but we do expect on a full year basis, solid year-over-year growth in North America land, Russia and the Middle East. These are fairly predictable plans that we have in place.  We also expect to see modest growth from the current levels, not necessarily on a full-year basis, but from current levels in Europe, Africa and Latin America and the reason for this is that there are many significant oil producing countries in these two regions, which have a record low investment levels at this stage and we see signs that at least we're going to come off the bottom here. Whether that's going to translate into year-over-year growth, it's too early to say, but at least an increase from where we are today. And really the only place where we don't see any of these recovery signs as of yet is in Asia. So, all depending on what the various numbers on these three main trends pan out to be. There is a chance that revenue could be up. Obviously, that's what we are hoping for and that's what we're going to work towards and obviously market share and some of the other things that we are working on specifically are on the land rig introduction, around SPM and some of the early production facility work that we do. We have opportunities I would say to come in with higher revenue in 2017, but I'm not going to commit to this as of yet. I think we need to work out the details of the plans over the coming two, three months and we can give you a further update in January.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks Bill.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Thanks. Hey Paal in your remarks you commented that you have two rigs of the future in the fourth quarter in the U.S. That seems well ahead of schedule, most of its surprised is to be deployed in the U.S. So, here is two question, are you in fact ahead of schedule on this technology and two, can you talk about kind of where what types of feel this is going into, I am a little surprised it was going to be in the U.S. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Well so I would say that generally we are on track with the -- with both the engineering and the manufacturing of the rig of the future. So these two rigs are I would call them pilot versions. They don’t have all the features of the rig of the future, but they have a significant part of it and we are also going to be operating them around the overall software platform of how we want to do rig of the future going forward. So, they are manufactured in the U.S. and that's why we would like to basically put them out in operation close to home at this stage to make sure that we can get all the support and all the feedback from their operational performance and feed out into both the engineering and manufacturing work that is going on for the I would say the complete version of the rig, which is going to be rolled out and a number of them in 2017, that's already in the plans for them both the CapEx and the manufacturing for next year.
David Anderson: Okay. And then also in your release you talked about the continued free cash flow conversion and your ability to reinvest in the business. Can you expand a bit of what that means? Obviously you're reinvesting here -- you're putting money into the rig of the future. But is there other areas that you're kind of focused on to reinvest here? Is it a product? Is it a geography or is it something else you're talking about?
Paal Kibsgaard: Simon you want to comment.
Simon Ayat: Okay. I ‘m going to take this question. As we always said that the utilization of cash, the priority would be for the good of the business. As you know we are -- we ended the quarter with about $11 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And today we are very -- our growth of opportunities compared to return of capital to shareholders by given through buybacks. Our investments, the three elements of the CapEx, which remain to be very well tightly controlled, we are investing today almost 50% what we used to be at the height of the business and SPM and multi-client. So there is no other opportunities other than our inorganic growth it proves to be a viable proposition economically and the future of the business, but right now our priority is the growth of the business and other than that we would return it to shareholders.
David Anderson: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Great. Hey, good morning. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, Paal your commentary here in the press release and the results seem to be incrementally positive at least on the reservoir front driven by multi-client, it appears. I know in your prior commentary on the cycle recovery, the reservoir piece of the business would probably lag in growth. Is there a shift underway subtle or otherwise in seismic activity that might push reservoir up a little bit further on the recovery curve?
Paal Kibsgaard: So, I don’t think there is yet a big turnaround I would say in the exploration market or in the seismic market. But I think we have positioned ourselves very well in both of those markets. Whatever work there is I think we are able to generally pick up on the exploration side and I think on seismic, as I again said in July, the performance of WesternGeco in a very, very tough market is quite commendable. We do quite well on both marine and land and we have been quite opportunistic on the multi-client side to make a significant investment in several basins around the world in particular Mexico, but also Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. part as well as overseas and obviously at this stage, we are able to generate revenue and profits from these investments, which you see very clearly in our results. So there is no I would say significant market turnaround, but I think it's a strong performance from the exploration related businesses that we have, including seismic and also within the testing services product line, which fits in reservoir characterization, we have won a series of early production facility projects where we have combined the capabilities that we had within the testing services prior with the processing capabilities that Cameron had. And this is again really strengthening the offering we have in this market and we see that also as a significant growth opportunity within characterization.
Kurt Hallead: That’s great. My follow-up is you said earlier about if I understood it correctly that you were in a position to potentially go over some market share in North America. I wasn't quite clear on the perspective on the international front. So I was just wondering if you just might be able to go through the thought process on the market share dynamics and how you see that opportunity vis-à-vis pricing and profitability?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I would say in international market we have, I would say actively pursued market share for the past for the past, I would say 12 to 18 months, I think with reasonable success. I think if you look at Characterization Drilling & Production combined, takeaway Cameron, we have pretty solid revenue evolution in all three international operating areas in the third quarter. And I’m quite pleased to see the progress we have made there. Whenever you start aiming to increase your tend to win rate which we now have been focusing on for a good 18 months or so, it takes a bit of time before that translates into actual revenue, but you're starting to see some impact of that.
Kurt Hallead: The main -- so there is really no main shift internationally. The main thing I was pointing out for North America is that -- on the drilling side, we now have a clear path in U.S. land towards profitability, based on the technology off-take we're seeing linked to these super laterals and as soon as we can turn a profit we are very keen to grow market share and we've basically shifted the playbook from holding the fort to going for market share in drilling in U.S. land, but we have not yet done that for fracing because at this stage it is highly dilutive to our earnings and at this stage also we are see a clear path towards profitability.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay, that's great clarification. Thanks Paal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
James Wicklund: Good morning, guys. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning Jim.
James Wicklund: Mexico, you've been shooting seismic there coming into this downturn make a change to constitution more quickly than a lot of us have expected, they've been several different grounds and now you talk about there may be some light at the end of that tunnel in '17 that was always a market of fabulous potential in their budget at rival Petrobras is in the past. Can you talk about how you see Mexico evolving over the next year or two please?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah I think, I share your view of the potential of the market. And I also think we are pretty much close to the bottom of it right. We have had -- we’ve seen a significant reduction in PEMEX activity over the past couple of years. And while this whole, industry reform has been taking place that reduction has not been I would say compensated by additional investments from the emerging international players. But as these bid rounds for acreage now has progressed and with the deepwater around coming up, the first deepwater coming up now in December, we see drilling activity picking up in 2017. Again, it might not be a dramatic comeback and we won’t be back to, I would say 2013 levels or 2014 levels anytime soon. But I think there is a momentum shift coming in Mexico. It is partly linked to the seismic work that we're doing and the related exploration activity with that, but I think also activity linked to the previous rounds that we've seen both in shallow water and on land as well as the basic PEMEX activity should pick up in 2017.
James Wicklund: So more enduring recovery. Okay. Thank you. A follow-up if I could, one of the first comment you made on the call Paal was you're not allocating assets to work that doesn't meet your return hurdles and you said the process has started. We've seen a number of companies decide not to participate in markets or product lines or with customers where they don't generate an adequate return. Can you talk about a little bit level down in granularity what exactly that means and what we should expect to see in that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, so first of all, when you're in a cyclical business, you will have to be pragmatic when you are near or at bottom of the cycle. So, which we are and we are basically maintaining our presence, pretty much everywhere in the world at this stage even at bottom and even though we have a number of contracts, which at this stage does not our meet our medium to long-term return criteria. But what we are saying though is that as we now are starting to come off bottom as oil prices are starting to move upwards, then we will need to have these discussions with the customers, where we have these type of contracts and try to find a way where we can get pricing and terms and conditions and a work scope that will enable us to meet those financial return criteria at the same time, as our customers can also meet theirs. So I think these are the discussions that now are taking place. This won't be resolved over night, but we are very clear on the fact that if we have to deploy capacity investments and expertise, there has to be return in it and at the bottom, we are willing to compromise. But as we come off bottom, we need to basically restore the return expectations that we have as a company and as our shareholders have in order to drive the business forward.
James Wicklund: Okay. Thank you very much guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Hi, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Sean Meakim: Thinking about OneSubsea how are you seeing opportunities for larger projects shaping up for next year or do you see it as mostly a Brownfield tieback boosting type of market for 2017?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, let me -- it’s a good question and it's a market that's in a state of change right now, but let me just talk about deepwater in general. It's continued to be challenged and in this quarter we saw five additional rigs get stacked. They are in Q3 and deepwater rig utilization dropped to 55% in the month of September. So you expect 2016 deepwater drilling activity as a whole to be down 33%. And when you think about that for OneSubsea and Project as we go forward we think this year tree award is significantly under a 100 and when we look at our project list, we're tracking between anywhere between five and eight awards that could happened in 2017 and those would be the larger style awards that we've seen traditionally. But our focus really now has shifted to the tieback market and we do see a lot of opportunities on that. I mentioned our eight paid studies with Subsea 7 where we're doing a lot of work on the tieback side and what we think there is that, with a standardized Subsea Tree, which is a at a significantly reduced cost a single well boosting system, which we're the only ones right now that have that single well boosting system. Combined that now with our Unified Control System and the installation from Subsea 7, we think we've got a very economical package to tie back one and two wells in the existing host facility. So we had a lot of discussions around that and we really it's almost creating a market right now and so we hope that we can give some more excitement and more awards around that as we transition into '17 and then as these big projects kind of progress and move forward, we're offsetting that with this expanded tieback market.
Sean Meakim: Got it. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just thinking about capital deployment going forward, and the free cash flow profile of the business, is it fair to say that following transformation of the cost reduction, the capital intensity of the core services business should remain below historical levels, you just think about, how you think about the capital deployed for that part of the business stay below D&A next year as well.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, so I think, based on what we are focusing on from the transformation standpoint, we still have a long runway to go in terms of driving asset utilization for the existing asset base and also what we have going in our engineering programs as well to also engineer and manufacture less expensive assets is also a key part of it. So both utilization and the cost per asset, I think should lead to a light or capital intensity of our business going forward. I think you've seen the signs of it in the past two, three years and we are going to continue to work very hard on further improving on that. 
Sean Meakim: Great, thanks Paal. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you. Welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from London following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Rowe, President, Cameron Group. Scott will join the earnings call through the fourth quarter this year to provide an update on the Cameron Group business integration and synergies. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon, Scott and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, then Scott will provide the Cameron update, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involves risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Please make your questions concise and limit them to one related follow-up. I'll now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23. This represents decreases of $0.17 sequentially and $0.65 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the second quarter, we recorded $2.9 billion of pre-tax charges. This consisted of $1.9 billion of asset impairments, $646 million relating to workforce reductions, and $355 million of merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron which closed on April 1, 2016. The asset impairments are a result of the challenging market condition that continued to deteriorate during the first half of 2016. These impairments will not result in any cash outflows. As we indicated last quarter, we continued to tailor our resources to activity levels, unfortunately, this resulted in additional workforce reductions. The $335 million of merger and integration charges consists of $150 million non-cash inventory-related purchase accounting item, with the balance relating to transaction costs as well as a dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. Our second-quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. This included a full quarter of activity from Cameron which added $1.5 billion to our top line. Excluding the impact of Cameron, revenue decreased 14% sequentially reflecting continued activity declines, pricing pressure and a reduction of activity in Venezuela to better match cash collections. Pre-tax operating margins, including the effects of Cameron, decreased 404 basis points, sequentially, to 10.4%. Cameron was accretive to Schlumberger's pre-tax operating margin as well as earning per share and cash flow. Highlights by product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially, while margin decreased 228 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were largely driven by Wireline and Testing Services activity declines across all of the international areas, most notably in Latin America. Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 18% sequentially while margin declined 649 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by significant rig count reductions and pricing pressure across all areas, the largest declines were experienced in Latin America and North America. Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 11% sequentially and margins fell by 459 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and further pricing pressure in North America land. Latin America also saw significant activity declines. As previously mentioned, the Cameron Group contributed revenue of $1.5 billion while generating pre-tax operating margin of 15.8%. On a pro forma basis, this represents a 6% sequential revenue decline and 130 basis points margin improvement. The decrease in revenue was largely driven by a declining project backlog as well as the further slowdown in U.S. land that impacted the shorter cycle businesses. The margin improvement was driven by strong project execution, offset in part by the effects of the activity decline in U.S. land. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. Our corporate and other expense line has increased $69 million sequentially. This increase is driven by the $63 million of the quarterly amortization expense from the intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cameron purchase accounting. The Schlumberger effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the second quarter essentially the same as Q1. As I highlighted last quarter with these reduced overall levels of pre-tax income that we are experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR potentially resulting in volatility going forward. Our tax rate will continue to be very sensitive to the overall geographic mix of earnings. We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite paying approximately $285 million in severance and $100 million in one-off transaction related fees during the quarter. Our net debt increased $3.4 billion during the quarter to $10 billion. This expected increase was driven by the $2.8 billion of cash we paid the Cameron shareholders and the $785 million of net debt we assumed in connection with the transaction. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $11.6 billion. During the quarter, we spent $31 million to repurchase 428,000 shares at an average price of $72.77. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $450 million on CapEx, $130 million of SPM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments. Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1 billion, which includes one quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the second half of 2016 is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. These amounts do not include investment in SPM or multiclient. And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott.
Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited: Thanks, Simon, and hello, everyone. This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron's key developments in 2016 and provide you with some color on how the integration is progressing. The Cameron business has continued perform well in light of current market conditions. The margin progression journey that we started in 2014 has continued in our long cycle businesses with strong execution of our backlog in our Drilling, OneSubsea and Process Systems business units. We have continued to deliver our backlog while driving cost out of the system, generating enhanced margins through the cycle. For example, drilling margins were significantly accretive, and subsea margins were at the Cameron Group margin level. As you can imagine, our shorter cycle businesses, Surface and Valves & Measurement are being impacted by both volume and significant pricing pressure. Despite these pressures, both Valves & Measurement and Surface have positive operating income and are delivering solid cash flow. Overall, the Cameron Group was able to deliver healthy cash flow and operating margins of 15.8% in the quarter, which is nearly an all-time high for Cameron. However, the Cameron Group is not immune to the downturn, as you can see in our second quarter book to bill ratio of 0.68x. This will have a continued impact on revenue in 2017 as our longer cycle businesses continue to move downward and our backlog reduced to $3.7 billion in these businesses at the end of the quarter. Let's switch to our business unit level detail starting with OneSubsea. OneSubsea continues to build on the vision that we created when forming the venture in 2013. In fact, we've just been awarded Woodside's Greater Enfield development, which is truly the first award that brings together the full capabilities that OneSubsea has to offer. This will be booked in July. We have been working closely with Woodside since we were awarded their subsea frame agreement in 2014. Our success in the frame agreement evolved to an integrated FEED study which led to project award. In this project we used our integrated solutions expertise, including flow assurance capabilities, our systems engineering to best configure the seafloor architecture, our seafloor boosting capabilities, our standardized horizontal SpoolTree, and subsea landing string. We are very pleased to be working with Woodside and finding cost-effective solutions to move deepwater developments from concept to reality. With these engagements, the OneSubsea team continues to move up the learning curve on how to find deepwater solutions that are one, cost enabling; two, deliver more production at a higher recovery factor; three, bring projects to market significantly faster; and ultimately, improve the financial returns of deepwater developments. We are also working on the SPS and SURF interface where we believe there are cost and efficiency gains. We now have three paid FEED studies for our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance, and we're working on another 20-plus engagements currently. Other recent activities include the six tree award for Pterobel's Zohr gas development in Egypt, which utilized a quick FEED approach and a supplier-led solution to meet a very aggressive timeline at a significantly reduced cost. Additionally, OneSubsea has successfully commissioned two boosting systems in the Gulf of Mexico. OneSubsea continues to have 100% of the working seafloor boosting systems in the world. Our leadership and history in boosting positions OneSubsea extremely well to capitalize on the smaller developments that tie back to existing infrastructure and whose facilities. Our unique offering of a single well-boosting system combined with a standard subsea tree works perfectly for this growing market. Each of the Cameron businesses are handling this cycle well in executing on our downturn playbook which focused on cost reduction, market share preservation and price optimization. As we move into Schlumberger, we are sharpening our focus on our service offering to capitalize on our large global installed base of equipment, and we continue to enhance our portfolio with a renewed commitment to technology. I can't tell you how proud I am of the Cameron employees as we continue to perform exceptionally well despite the industry's worst downturn and while executing a major corporate integration. Now, I'd like to turn to the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger. To start, I think it can be best summarized as a successful continuation of the collaboration and partnership that we started in OneSubsea. The Cameron and Schlumberger teams continue to work together in an impressive manner, and I'm happy to report that the progress in the first three months has exceeded all of our expectations. In the second quarter, we booked $125 million of synergy-related business, which was significantly ahead of our original plan. We are also on track to deliver the $300 million of synergies in the first 12 months from closing. We continue to find unexpected opportunities across all of the Cameron businesses, including Valves & Measurement and Processing, as we leverage the substantial capabilities of Schlumberger's vast geographic organization. Additionally, we continue to build on the concept of integrating the subsurface capabilities of Schlumberger with the surface pressure control and processing capabilities of Cameron. We started this in OneSubsea and we are now seeing opportunities in drilling, unconventional production and production and processing facilities. Finally, we have started over 30 new technology development programs as part of the integration and we are confident that these programs will deliver significant revenue synergies and growth opportunities when the markets do recover. Overall, the integration is progressing very well and the combination and collaboration has been positively received by the Cameron employees, the Schlumberger employees and our customers. Now, I'll turn it over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle. In line with the previous six quarters of this downturn, we continue to navigate the challenging environment with an unwavering focus on protecting the overall financial health of the company. This enabled us to generate a positive operating income of $747 million, excluding credits and charges; maintain operating margins north of 10%; and, more importantly, produce a positive operating cash flow of $1.6 billion. This solid financial performance came as a result of strong execution and in some cases at the expense of revenue, as we now have started to shift focus onto recovering our pricing concessions and high-grading our contract portfolio. Second quarter revenue increased 10% sequentially, boosted by the inclusion of a full quarter's activity for the Cameron Group, which amounted to $1.5 billion. However, activity for all groups decreased in the quarter as E&P budgets were further reduced. The revenue headwinds were most pronounced in North America and further exacerbated by a decision to reduce our operations in Venezuela to fall in line with cash collections, which had a significant impact on our Latin America results. In terms of pre-tax operating income, close to 75% of our sequential drop was caused by North America and Venezuela. As I review the second quarter geographical trends, I will use pro forma numbers for the sequential comparison while I focus my comments on the Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups as Scott has already covered the Cameron Group in detail. In North America, revenue declined 20% sequentially against an average drop in the U.S. land rig count to 25%, as the activity slide now have reached bottom. The doubling in the WTI oil price since the lows seen in January of this year has also led some customers to start moving drilled but uncompleted shale wells out of inventory and into production, with the associated increase in hydraulic fracturing activity. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity was weaker as additional deepwater exploration rigs were released and the move to development activity slowed. Pricing remained under massive pressure in all land and offshore markets in North America. However, signs have started to emerge of customers recognizing that pricing levels have now fallen to unsustainable levels, leading to a growing risk of destroying capabilities and capacity required in the future. Within our North America business, the Drilling Group was the hardest hit in the second quarter with Drilling & Measurements, Bits and Drilling Tools, and M-I SWACO seeing the greatest activity decline. In Reservoir Characterization, however, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partly offset by sequentially stronger WesternGeco work in both Canada and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In the international markets customer budget cuts, activity disruptions, seasonal variations and persisting pricing pressure impacted our results in most basins and market segments around the world. In Latin America, revenue declined 26% sequentially as activity in Venezuela fell significantly following our decision to reduce operations to fall in line with cash collections. This program is managed in close coordination with all customers in the country and operations are continuing for the Faja IOC joint ventures and for some specific PDVSA operations. Activity also decreased in Mexico and Brazil as customer budgets were curtailed further, leaving the remaining activity rig count in these two countries at very low levels. From a technology standpoint, the Drilling Group saw the largest drop in revenue with significant reductions in all product lines. In the Production Group, lower revenue from our traditional product lines was offset by robust integration-related performance with all our projects in the region progressing well. In Reservoir Characterization our multiclient seismic program in Mexico continued in advance of the upcoming deepwater license rounds. So far we have delivered more than 40,000 square kilometers of high resolution wide-azimuth seismic data, and early evaluation of the data is already leading to clearer identification on new exploration plays in the Golfo Campeche (sic) [Golfo de Campeche] Basin. Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 7% sequentially as widespread activity reductions throughout our Sub-Saharan Africa operations had a significant impact on our results. Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea saw the largest fall, but the rig count in Angola also fell sharply together with Central/West Africa where key exploration campaign was completed. In the North Sea, rig-related activity in the UK increased while revenue was lower in Norway as seasonal shutdowns and a changing job mix impacted results. These negative factors affected all parts of our business in the area and particularly the Drilling and Production Groups. Within Reservoir Characterization, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partially offset by improving seismic revenues from WesternGeco. In Russia, revenue increased as the summer season ramped up in line with expectations and was further supported by the appreciation of the Russian ruble. Activity was strongest for Drilling & Measurements and Well Services, driven by solid drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity both on land and shallow offshore. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue declined by 2% sequentially as lower activity in Asia more than offset strong activity in the Middle East. In Asia, activity was weakest in the Malaysia and Australia GeoMarkets as projects were canceled or completed and the offshore rig count dropped further. The Drilling Group was most affected by this through lower demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies, while Reservoir Characterization was also lower on weaker wireline exploration activity. In the Middle East, strength in the GCC countries offset weakness in the Iraq, Oman and Egypt GeoMarkets. In Kuwait, increased rig count, continued progress on the early production facilities we are building for the Jurassic project, together with higher artificial lift and completions product sales drove revenue higher. While in Saudi Arabia, activity also increased driven by market share gains from the latest rig allocations as well as higher hydraulic fracturing activity. I would now like to turn to the state of our industry and also how we continue to position Schlumberger in the forefront of a challenging and evolving operating environment. We are now seven quarters into the most severe industry downturn on record, which saw oil prices tumbling to $27 this January. Since then, we have seen a slow but steady increase in oil prices as the market data continues to show a tightening of the supply and demand balance, and with the outlook clearly suggesting that these trends will further accelerate going forward. While the current level of oil prices have created unprecedented turmoil throughout our industry, the financial challenges that have now become very visible are really nothing new. For some time, there has been a growing shortfall of both profits and cash flow for many oil producers around the world, as the cost of developing increasingly complex oil resources has outgrown the value created, which could be seen even when oil prices were at $100 per barrel. The dramatic restructuring of the supply side we are currently experiencing has just accelerated and amplified the cost, quality and efficiency problems of the industry and led to a more acute cash and profitability crisis. The operators have reacted to this crisis by initiating a massive reduction in oilfield activity and by sending unsustainable pricing shock throughout the entire oil industry supply chain. In addition, there is currently also a widespread high-grading of activity taking place in the industry aimed at maximizing short-term production and cash flow. Adding up all of this, the current cost per barrel for the oil producers now appears to be significantly lower than what was the case seven quarters ago. However, this should not be confused with a permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance as there has been little to no fundamental change in technology, quality or efficiency, no major step change in industry collaboration and no general transformation of the industry business model. What has taken place over the past 21 months is, instead, a redistribution of the profit and cash flow shortfall from previously sitting mostly with the oil producers to now representing an unsustainable burden for the supplier industry even after a massive reduction of costs and capacity. So where does this lead the industry? First of all, assuming that we continue to see a steady growth in demand, we are heading towards a significant global supply deficit as the E&P spend rate now is down by more than 50%. The effect of the reduced E&P spend is already clearly visible in the 2016 non-OPEC production numbers, which are set to drop by 900,000 barrels per day versus last year, and can also be seen by the weakness in the OPEC production outside of the Gulf countries. And as the opportunities for activity high-grading are exhausted, we should see a further acceleration in the global production decline. In addition, the market is also underestimating the potential reaction from the supplier industry, which has temporarily accepted financially unviable contracts to support the operators and to keep their options open as the downturn has deepened and extended into uncharted territory. This is seen by the service industry profit levels and also from their ballooning receivables balances caused by operators who are unable or unwilling to provide timely payments. It also means that, inevitably, service industry pricing has to recover and as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P investment increases intended for additional activity which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit. So how are we navigating this challenging industry environment? To start with, we believe that the chronic shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the oil industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance. This has to begin with the transformation of the intrinsic quality and efficiency of each industry player but it also requires the design of much broader technology systems, including both innovative hardware as well as high-level software control systems. In addition, we believe that the future industry winners will be the companies that can more effectively integrate the entire industry value chain through an open and collaborative business model with much better commercial alignment between the key contributing parties. After seven quarters of managing our business in an increasingly complex industry environment where we have made a series of strategic and tactical moves, we are well advanced in shaping and positioning our company for future success as can be seen by the following facts. First, our balance sheet remains strong with more than $11 billion in cash and short-term investments. And we are also one of the few companies in the industry that still generates a positive free cash flow after actively reinvesting in our business and steadily returning cash to our shareholders in form of dividends and stock buybacks. Second, we have an unprecedented global technology offering that we have significantly expanded in past 21 months through the purchase of a number of smaller technology companies as well as the major acquisition of Cameron. Third, the addition of the Cameron Group to our technology portfolio will enable the development of major integrated technology systems including our land drilling system and future hydraulic fracturing system and a new surface production system that combines processing, measurements and control. Fourth, we have established a range of tiered integration business models that enable us to evolve our customer engagements as well as the type of contracts we take on. And last, the benefits we are seeing from our transformation program are creating a significant and long-term competitive advantage to a steady improvement in our internal intrinsic performance. In Schlumberger, we continue to have a stated goal of serving all customers in all basins and countries around the world, provided it is permissible by local and international law, that it's safe for our people and assets, and that it is financially viable. And as oil prices have doubled since the lows in January, we have now shifted our focus from decremental margins and increasing our tender win rates over to our contract portfolio, where we are looking to recover the temporary pricing concessions we have made or renegotiate those contracts which, at present, show no promise of becoming financially viable. As we now enter a new phase of the cycle, oilfield activity has to increase in most countries around the world for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. The sustainability of this activity recovery will be defined by the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain, which will vary significantly from country to country. And in places where the total value chain remains in a chronic financial shortfall, the increase in activity will not be sustainable. A key question in this respect is the sustainability of a North American land recovery where the cumulative industry earnings and free cash flow was negative over the last cycle. And given the resulting financial state of the value chain in this commoditized market, a large wave of cost inflation from every part of the supplier industry is now building, which the E&P companies will have to absorb in parallel with implementing their activity growth plans. As we now enter the next phase of the cycle, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale and our knowledge of the financial viability of the industry value chain in each operating country will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. In preparation for the next phase, we have already reenergized our management team and formulated detailed plans for how we will navigate this new environment. And as part of this, we have set ourselves a companywide goal on delivering incremental margins higher than 65% on the forthcoming activity growth. The combination of the tactical and strategic moves we have made and are continuing to make has enabled us to navigate the challenging industry environment better than most, and above all, will ensure that Schlumberger continues to remain at the absolute forefront of an industry that is set to undergo significant change in the coming years. That concludes my remarks. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: Okay. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, guys. Paal, after...
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, James.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): ...after that discussion on the future of the global industry, which was nothing short of very impressive, I feel bad asking such pedestrian questions as I have but I'll give it a shot. You talk about pricing and sustainability and the unsustainable pricing that we have, investor focus today seems definitely to be on North America because the expectation it's going to recover first. And in North America, the biggest concern still seems to be on pressure pumping. And historically, you guys would improve your margins by increasing utilization of equipment, and that would be the first big run in improving your margins and then pricing would follow at some point in the future as utilization got higher. You talk about how things are different this time. Can you talk about your outlook for what happens in the U.S. pressure pumping market, how fast pricing comes back, how you will be able to get pricing and what will cause that pricing improvement ahead of some of your peers? I guess that's more of a technology versus commodity discussion. But can you walk us through, just on a regional basis, if you would, your outlook on how pressure pumping utilization and pricing evolve over the next year or two?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, that's quite a broad question, Jim, but I would say that we are clear that we have reached the bottom of activity in North America land, and that activity will increase not in a V shape dramatic fashion but I think there will be a steady increase in rig counts and associated frac activity, both from the rigs as from wells coming out of the DUC inventory. Now again, I think the activity will be more slow and steady. And obviously, with higher utilization, there is some contribution to margins. But margins are deeply negative and I would say at this stage, more activity at the current margin level is just going to be dilutive to earnings. So I think most companies now will be looking for price increases and, in fact, significant price increases actually to bring profitability back to breakeven and into positive territory before that activity is particularly attractive in terms of driving earnings back to previous year's levels. So how do we get the pricing? I think, obviously, technology, efficiency, managing supply chain is going to be important, but I think overall, the entire value chain in North America is highly stressed. As I indicated, in the previous cycle, it's cumulatively negative both on profits and free cash flow so I don't think there is an open-ended dramatic improvement at hand without doing anything. I think technology has to play a very important role in this. We've said in many foras that if you look at the cost per well, I think we are in late innings, but in terms of production per well, we are in very early innings. And if you want to drive down cost per barrel, we have to look at ways of getting more production out of each well. But – although utilization will help but given the pain that the entire industry value chain is in, there's going to be a mounting wave of cost inflation from every supplier in that chain, which I think is going to put significant pressure on how quickly activity can recover.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's very helpful. And my follow-up if I could, you mentioned Canada and the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Mexico in terms of WesternGeco, exploration has been in the ditch for the last two and a half years and from the sound of it, WesternGeco appeared to have a very good quarter. Should we see this as the beginning of some level of recovery in seismic and in exploration overall?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I would love to say yes to that but I think it's unfortunately premature. I would complement WesternGeco on actually doing a very good job in gaining market share and getting projects which are financially viable, driven again by technology and how well they execute. They've also been good at positioning ourselves in terms of multiclient activity where we continue to get good pre-funding. But I would say there is no immediate, I would say, dramatic comeback in exploration or in seismic in particular, but within the context of a very depressed market, WesternGeco is actually performing quite well
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Paal, thank you. Impressive presentation. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thanks. Good morning. So Paal, during the downturn one of the concerns is that if you lose pricing internationally, you never get it back. But clearly, you're quite confident recouping much of the pricing concessions. I guess once again – sorry asking a dumb question – but what makes the difference this time. Is it the repricing triggers you have in your contracts? Is it the competitive dynamics have clearly shifted here or is it the oil prices giving you the confidence to recoup those pricings?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: If you compare it to the previous downturn in 2009, at that stage, the industry came off a massive price increase period of four years, five years. And at that stage, pricing came down and it basically has not come back since then. So we are in a very different situation industrywide at this stage where the service industry hasn't had a price increase in the period in between now and 2009, so there isn't that much to give. Profitability for the more profitable companies have come through internal transformations and through significant investments in technology, like in our case. So we have not gained any pricing so we have very little pricing to give up. Now in a dramatic downturn as we have been experiencing over the past seven quarters, there is a need to align with the customer base, which obviously has immediate oil price exposure, and we have done that, and the vast majority of the pricing concessions we have made to existing and valid contracts are temporary in nature, they're either time bound or they are linked to some kind of oil price trigger. And that's why we have aligned with our customers on the down of the cycle and we now expect that, that would be returned to us as oil prices start to increase. So it is quite a different situation today than the previous downturn that we were facing in 2009 and 2010.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And I guess – perhaps you could just expand a little bit on the increased activity you were talking about in the Middle East, particularly in the GCC. You've been talking about Kuwait's getting a little better, you talked about some increases in Saudi. Is there any talk over there about perhaps expansion projects or maybe a renewed focus on improving recovery rates that have a greater technology component for you? Any shift along those lines?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think there is a constant discussion within all of these large producers in the core part of OPEC or in the GCC around how they maintain or even increase production, right. So it varies by country and we leave it up to the country to, I would say, formalize and state those plans. But I would say Saudi has an active program to maintain their maximum sustainable production level which is widely known, while there are also very active programs in both the UAE and Kuwait to increase production. This includes both drilling of wells, seismic activity, as well as fracking and even surface facilities. So we are very actively involved in all aspects of this, our technology is very central to all of these projects and we are extremely well placed to continue to take our share of the growth in activity in this part of the world.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks a lot. I wonder whether you could talk a bit about the opportunity for Schlumberger to drive better pricing and margins through integration and technology. Is this an opportunity that's best presented in North America or is it in certain international markets? Can you talk a little bit more specific about when and where exactly we should expect you to sign for this first?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, as you know, Ole, we have a broad range of integration capabilities, which ranges all the way from project coordination to integrated drilling, integrated production and all the way up to SPM. And I think those four models are applicable in pretty much every country and basin around the world, depending on the state of the customer, the interest of the customer and what kind of resources they're developing, right. But we see a general, I would say, adaptation of all aspects of integration taking place all around the world. The least impact of integration so far, if I just look at the high level, has been in North America where it's still rather fragmented in between the rig and the various parts of the drilling process as well as in the production and completion part of the work. So we are continuing to drive forward our offering around creating a total drilling system and a total completion system, including fracking, for the land markets. And I'm quite optimistic that these should have significant uptake even in places like U.S. land or some of the other unconventional basins around the world, but the general adaptation of more integration we are seeing, and we continue to invest into that both from a hardware and software process control standpoint.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. And then when it comes to the when and where, you addressed the where but the when part, is there something we should start to see already now in the third quarter, some evidence that – some of the initiatives you're rolling out actually translates to higher margins if it does look at what you're doing internally and isolate away the broader cycle?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, in terms of margins, I think – we are looking to get margins in the base business as well right, because that's where we have made the largest pricing concessions and that's where we also want to get back some of the temporary concessions we've made. But I think all the integration-related business offerings we have is executed well and well aligned with the customer, brings value in terms of higher profitability to us but also lower cost per barrel for our customers, right. So in terms of timing of it, Ole, it's difficult to say that you're going to see some kind of major impact in one particular quarter. I think the level of integration-related activity has held up well, I would say, during this downturn. It is down in percentage terms, which you would expect, but it has held up well as well as our new technology sales has held up well also during the cycle. So I think we're very well positioned. And as activity starts to increase and resources, both on the customer side as well as on the service industry side, becomes shorter, then I think the multi-skilling and presenting one package with simpler interfaces is going to be quite appealing to the customer base.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Makes sense. My follow-up with you, Scott. If you could give us a little bit more detail on the Greater Enfield, where it seems to be quite a few firsts there in terms of integration of reservoir management and flow assurance to the hardware side. And if you could talk just a little bit through what exactly is it that's new in terms of what you achieved with this contract.
Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited: Yeah, good.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: What does it entail?
Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited: Yeah, absolutely, Ole. Look, this is a flagship win for the OneSubsea team and, as you know, we've been working with Woodside for a long time to first win their frame agreement then indeed to move this project forward. But as Paal just discussed, right, this is a big technology play and it allows us to preserve some pricing because we can uniquely differentiate ourselves from anybody else. But what we've done here is essentially provide relatively standard horizontal trees combined with the boosting system and then the real technology is with the Unified Controls System that will span both the boosting system and the subsea architecture as well as the completion with the landing string. And so now, we've got a Unified Controls System that controls all aspects that sit on the seafloor, and you could imagine the cost savings for the customer when you bring all of that together. So, again, we've worked real hard with Woodside. We're very excited to move this project forward with them and we think it's a great example of the true capabilities of OneSubsea.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ole.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited: Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: So maybe as a quick follow-up on the Cameron question for Scott. Very impressive margins in the quarter. Can you give us your thoughts about margins moving forward into the back half of the year and maybe even 2017, and also discuss what your order outlook is out there, what you're hearing and seeing as far as opportunities for OneSubsea.
Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited: Sure. It's a broad question but we can provide some general guidance here. Look. The 15.8% that we were able to achieve in the quarter was exceptional. And as you know, it's one of the highest quarters we've ever had. The forward look is a little bit complicated because what's happening is we've got really strong execution in both Drilling, OneSubsea and Process systems, and those are our bigger backlog and longer-cycle businesses, and those are going to start to come down. And now, you've got a lot of pricing pressure that we've seen in 2015 start to come into the mix. And so we think 15.8% is a very high level, that will start to taper down here in the quarters to come. And then where we really start to see some uplift and it's a matter of timing here, but as Paal described, right, we do believe we're going to get pricing in the shorter-cycle businesses, so both Surface and Valves & Measurement. And then in addition to that, you start to layer in the synergies from the integration itself. And so I don't expect us to exceed the 15.8% here in the short term. I think that comes down steadily over time. But then as we get pricing traction and those short-cycle businesses begin to pick up, we could indeed see those margins come back up into a higher territory. And in terms of booking outlook, I'll start with deepwater. And what I'll say is it is in a very bad state in terms of progressing and moving projects forward. And we're very fortunate to work with Woodside and get one past FID, but we don't see any major projects here for the remainder of the year. In fact, our estimates for trees this year are less than 100. There are a few projects out there next year that are relatively large in size. We feel good about our ability to work with operators and achieve those, but at the same time, the industry has got significant capacity, and those are going to be incredibly competitive. And so I'm a little concerned about the outlook with deepwater. Now, however, the counter to that is we have a very strong belief in what we're doing with OneSubsea. And like I described in the opening comments, right, the ability to tie the reservoir to what we're doing, drive cost out of the system through our standardized approach and then get more out of production, we feel very good about that. On the other businesses, Surface and V&M are tied to rig count and they have a significant North American exposure and, as Paal described, we think those markets start to increase here going forward. And so that's going to be the big kind of flux position for us, if you will, if those start to come back faster, then our outlook starts to look pretty good.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Okay. Very, very helpful Scott. And then one more for Paal is, when we think of Schlumberger in the past and we think about revenue growth, we used to think through it on a GeoMarket basis and you guys have done a very good job in recent presentations giving the incremental margin opportunities across your product lines. So when you think about now your product segments and the rank order of revenue growth coming out of the trough, is it fair to think that Production and Drilling has the largest revenue opportunities out of the bottom followed by Cameron and Characterization? And any thoughts on magnitude of difference would be helpful.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So I think that's a reasonable assumption, Angie. We believe that the activity increase that we are going to see in the coming quarters is going to be very closely associated with production. And that's either linked to that drilling or the completion part of production. So our Drilling Group and our Production Group, I think, are the ones that will see the quickest impact of higher E&P investments. Now with that said, at some stage, the industry will need to start exploring again, and the level of exploration-related activity is at an unprecedented low. So obviously a huge growth runway for our Characterization Group going forward when that starts to kick in, but I think you're right in assuming that that will be after the initial uptick in well-related development type of activity. And I think Scott has described very well the impact on Cameron, the long-cycle businesses, I think, will follow after the short cycle ones. So I think that's a good set of assumptions.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Fair enough. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Good afternoon where you are.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So Paal, I wanted to follow up here on comments on incremental margin goal of 65%. And I was hoping that you could provide a little additional color around that target vis-à-vis the U.S. market and the international market, and then I have additional follow-up after that.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right. So first of all, I didn't say 65% I said north of 65%.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I got it.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'm not ready to sort of break it down for you in any more geographical granularity other than it is a high level goal, it's an ambitious goal, but there is a logic behind it. I think first of all, our decrementals for 2015 and so far in 2016 is in the range of 30% to 32%. And if you can double the incremental from that decremental rate, that means that you should be able to restore 2014 earnings, which is the place we want to be as quickly as possible to continue to deliver on the plan we laid out in the 2014 investor conference, we can actually recover 2014 earnings by only a 50% recovery in the revenue drops that we've seen since 2014. Now there is a lot of work behind the number in terms of how achievable it is. But as an example, in 2014 in the international market, on a pretty low revenue growth rate of 3%, 4%, we actually delivered 69% incrementals without any price in the international markets. So we have a precedence for doing it, it's obviously going to be challenging to do that also in North America, in particular North America land, but with the impact, we will have to have from price on this, we are for sure going to try to deliver incrementals north of 65%, yes.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then the follow up on that is regards to timing. So is the target of north of 65% incrementals by the end of 2016, is it for full year 2017? Can you just give us some general, might be hard to give the specifics, but some general views on when you're pushing to get that done?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think I would look at it in the following way. I would say that activity growth associated with some pricing recovery should – we are aiming to deliver north of 65% on that. So I think as we now navigate the bottom and we aren't expecting a uniform V shaped recovery here. Like I said, it's going to be in slow and steady recovery. Some of countries that we operate in will stay flat longer. Some of them might go down a little bit further. But overall, we believe we are at bottom and when we see consistent growth in any geography, this is the incremental that we are looking for. And as the entire company gets back into a more solid growth mode, that's when we should approach the companywide 65%. But we are targeting 65% incrementals on the growth that we are seeing going forward.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's great color. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Thanks. Paal, if we could just talk a little bit about the near term, if you will. You waxed optimistic here with regard to the industry bottoming and focusing more on market share strengthening versus, I guess, protecting decrementals and pricing recapture and high-grading of contracts. And yet, we just had a significant pre-tax charge, your rightsizing continues to be pretty assertive, and we've laid off 16,000 people in the first half. So I'm trying to reconcile those two, the challenges you see in the near term. And specifically, can we talk about Q3 in terms of what the sequential headwinds and tailwinds are and whether you think earnings per share, flat, up or down quarter-on-quarter?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So in terms of the charge that we've taken, this is basically catching up and finalizing the resizing of the company, which has now been dropping in activity levels over the past seven quarters. So this charge is linked to a number of things that we have been executing in the second quarter. And should bring the company into the shape where we are well positioned to navigate the bottom of the market and also well positioned to start growing again going forward. So we put a lot of details and scrutiny into any kind of impairment charge that we take and we have done so as well in the charge for Q2, which is sizable, but we believe this is prudent, this is right and it's justified to do what we've done and that's why we did it. Now in terms of the outlook, like I said, we are at the bottom but we are not expecting an immediate and sharp recovery. If you look at North America versus international and some of the moving parts going into Q3, North America still has significant overcapacity at this stage in terms of services. And the low barrier to entry is also going to continue to be a major headwind, right. So we expect modest increase in land activity but this is going to be partially offset by lower offshore work. We are significantly down in Alaska, in Eastern Canada, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect some improvement in pricing but it's going to be way short of the level required to breakeven into Q3. So we don't expect any major positive earnings improvement from North America in Q3 but it shouldn't get much worse either, right. So fairly, fairly stable earnings for North America in the third quarter. And fairly similar international markets, there's less overcapacity there due to the higher barrier entry and it's also quite a narrowing competitive landscape. So in principle, it should be easier to recover some of the temporary pricing concessions that we have made which, in most cases, in international market is also time bound or linked to the oil price. But given the limited increase in activity we see for Q3, again, we don't expect any significant positive sequential earnings contribution from international. So overall, we expect flattish EPS in Q3.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, I'm just curious with regard to the discussion that you're having with resource holders and especially domestic resource holders, just given the evisceration and impairment of the oil service value chain on the one hand, and the desire on the part of resource holders to preserve the efficiencies that they've won and earned over the course of this downturn, is there a recognition on their part that there are probably less than a handful of companies who possess both the operational and financial flexibility to in fact preserve those efficiencies for them?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, if you talk about efficiencies, are you talking about their current cost per barrel? Because that is to a large extent driven by very low service pricing, right. So I think there's no company in North America that is able to continue for a long period of time to operate at these pricing levels. But if you talk about the technical performance of how efficient we drill and how efficient we frac...
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Yeah.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: ...I agree with you. There's a handful of companies that can do that and I think that number is shrinking. And unless there is some pricing recovery and some ways to create more financially viable contracts for even these limited number of companies, that number is going to shrink further, yes.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: All right. Thank you, sir.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations: Okay. So we see that there are a number of questions still remaining and we're going to extend the call another 5 minutes to 10 minutes. So operator, please can you give us the next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Hey, good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Paal, clearly the strategy of the company has changed. You're switching to offense from playing defense with decrementals. This was obviously not a new strategy or you wouldn't be telling us about it today, it's not happening today. So I'm curious with this shift, when did you start, what's guidance you've given to your management team, and what has the customer response been so far to this trend of we're going to regain pricing and we will not work at these kind of pricing levels going forward?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So we've started this dialogue and this engagement, first of all, internally with our senior management team during the second quarter. This is not a – it's not a surprising playbook. At some stage when you do approach bottom, this is the shift that you need to make.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Right.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: But we have, I would say, done this in a concerted fashion during the second quarter. We have had very good discussions with the senior management team and laid our plans for how are we going to now shift the focus and how we navigate the next phase. And as I said earlier on, the understanding of the viability and state of the industry value chain in each of the 80 countries we operate in is extremely important to make sure that you are optimally positioned to capture the market in the countries which we believe are going to see a sustainable increase in activity, where we can also generate sustainable earnings going forward, right. So we spend a lot of time internally with the team to lay out these plans and put this methodology in place, so we are in good shape there. We're already in execution mode of it. And in terms of the engagement with the customers, it's started. It's still at a fairly, I would say, low frequency but that is now what we will do much more widespread as we enter the third quarter here. But obviously, a lot of these discussions are going to be challenging. There's not a lot of surplus in any situation but we believe that the temporary concessions we have made, at least part of that will need to be returned to us. But in return for that, we are very open to engage in different types of collaborations where we through a better management of the interface and better commercial alignment and together drive unnecessary costs out of the system, so that we can make a more or the industry value chain viable in many countries around the world. So that's certainly the objective.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: And that would mean increasing your scope or adding performance-based metrics to the contracts?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely. Both of those are aspects that we believe will generate total value that then can be shared between the supplier and the E&P companies, and also back to what we talked about earlier in the call, all around the integration offering that we have and that we continue to invest into.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Right. Okay. And then a follow-up from me on the market share. You commented in your press release about market share gains or tender wins in recent quarters. How much of this is due to, perhaps, technology or how much of this is due to just the fact that there's really only you and one other – globally now – that participate in the market and you've seen a lot of your competitors just drop out?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think the narrowing competitive environment has some impact on this. And also I think if you look at margin performance over the past 18 months in the international market in between several of the large players, some of these players are already in the red, in which case their room to take on contracts which they might feel is challenging is very, very limited. So the position we have in terms of strength, both in footprint, scale, local knowledge as well as the overall contract portfolio we have, allows us to be quite competitive in these tenders. And I think very importantly as well is to look at the difference between the contract portfolio and maybe the immediate revenue translation of these contracts. In the international market, it's very important to have the contracts, and we have a range of contracts today that we have won with very little activity in them, but they have potential for significant increases in activity in terms of rig additions and so forth going forward. So what is very important over the past year, which we have had a lot of focus on, has been the tender win rate and then having the contracts and then being able to translate that into revenue in the coming one to two years.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thanks. Paal, if I could follow up on your comment that the industry needs to improve efficiencies through I think you said innovative hardware and high-level software control systems. In the press release, there's an anecdote noting a pretty big drop in pump and blender NPT and R&M expense through the use of RCM technology and predictive analytics. I was wondering how scalable these types of applications are and whether or not the deployment depends on the introduction of the next generation frac spread or can it be rolled out on the legacy fleet?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So for that particular application, it is being rolled out on the legacy fleet. These are measurements that we are currently recording and we have been for quite a while. And this is one example of what we can do by being able to first organize our data in a way where it's accessible and then building the right analytic applications on top of it and then providing that to our fleet operations. So over the past 18 months or so, we have undertaken a massive reorganization of the entire database we have and the data we record on a daily basis from our operations into a cutting-edge data lake, which is then accessible for these type of applications. And we've also established a new applications group which then has the ability to build these analytics and tap into the data lake and provide this type of information for our operations. So the example you refer to in pressure pumping is one, we have a multitude of similar type of applications being built and which are going to be deployed in the near future with a similar type of impact on the operation, and this is all part of the transformation program that we've been talking about for several years.
Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited: If I could just add, this is a big part of the Cameron integration as well, right. So in Cameron, we really didn't progress the ability to collect data on our equipment and what we're doing is tapping in to the expertise here at Schlumberger. And in fact, more than half of our 30 integrated technology programs are around the theme of controls and predictive maintenance and reliability.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC: And just so I understand the quantitative impact, this $30 million reference of three-year cost savings, that was just with respect to that one test fleet?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Correct.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And if I could ask a follow-up quickly for Simon, in terms of the working capital management during the downturn, it's obviously been remarkable here. So, first of all, kudos. But my question really is how the transformation initiatives will work in recovery when working capital actually becomes a use of cash?
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Michael, as you mentioned, we performed well in second quarter despite some exceptional payments. And the transformation program is helping us quite a bit, it's on the CapEx side on some of the cost elements, collection of receivables. I mean the transformation program is across the board on most of our activity and processes. So it is going to – we're looking forward to not to consume as much cash in the upturn because first, we do have excess equipment, and we don't think the CapEx is going to turn around in a major way. And, yes, the transformation program will continue to contribute as it contributed in the downturn.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, Michael, just one clarification. So you asked me about the savings. So the savings we quoted was for all the test fleets we had in South Texas. It was not just one fleet.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Not just one. Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sorry, did I get the concern you have or the answer that you're looking for?
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Yes, you did, Simon. I was really sort of thinking about inventory and I guess the excess equipment has a big impact on that, so thank you.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Inventory is a big part of it as well, yes. That's what I meant by managing the material and supplies as well.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Yeah. Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Thanks for squeezing me on. So, Paal, you've been very clear that international is going to be the driver of earnings getting back to the 2015 or 2014 level, but some of your comments on North America have been a little bit more mixed, so just trying to understand what you're saying there about how the transformation program will pay dividends in the future. But are you also implying there that you can get back to peak margins in North America on a significantly lower rig count than what we saw previously?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, so just to clarify, so I'm saying that obviously our international business and the state of that and the state of the international industry value chain is in much better shape than what the North American value chain is, in which case the basis for sustainable earnings growth at this stage is much higher and better internationally. Now in North America, I think you've got to separate the industry view from just how Schlumberger navigates in the system, and I think the industry, I think there are some questions and challenges to be asked, right. How is the industry in the next upcoming cycle going to be able to operate where the entire value chain ends up being cash flow and profit-positive as we enter into a complete new cycle? That was not the case in the previous cycle, and I don't think we can go on for many cycles in a similar type of fashion. Now there is a part of North America land which is viable, even at lower prices, but how big that is and how much you can step up from the core acreage, I think, is to be seen. Now how we operate in that, we are aiming to be very competitive on efficiency and, in addition to that, continue to bring new technology into play which can help our customers and drive up production per well. And we have a very good offering already in place for that. So we will continue to operate the way we have been with a focus in both these dimensions. But I think at this stage, if you look at the state of the industry value chain, I can't tell you that we are going to get back to previous peak margins in North America or North America land because at this stage, I just don't see how that can be funded in the entire value chain.
Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks, and then one last one for Simon. Lots of free cash flow generation, but buybacks pretty much slowed to a trickle this quarter. So what happened there and what's the plan going forward?
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good question. So, look. We always said that we'll be opportunistic on our buyback, and we use excess cash or remaining cash, normally, after the business needs, to return it through buybacks. The $11.6 billion that we have in cash obviously do reflect excess cash. But excess cash should not be looked at on a one given period, we have to project several quarters in advance. And during the quarter, there were major cash movements in relation to the Cameron acquisition. The cash we paid to the shareholders, we bought back some of the debt of Cameron. So we took a decision to slow down the buyback, sit back, reassess our need of cash, given all the opportunities we have in front of us, and we will go back into the market. We're always in the market. Our policy will continue to be in the market, but it is not going to be evenly spread going forward.
Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Thanks a lot.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And it is an exceptional period during the quarter due to the acquisition and basically a reassessment of how we're going to use the cash, but buyback will always be a part of our plan.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thank you. So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the four most important points that we discussed. First, we believe that we've reached the bottom of the cycle and that E&P investments now have to increase in order for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. As E&P investment starts growing, a large part will initially have to be consumed on supplier industry price increases in order for capacity and capabilities to be available and for operating standards to be met. Second, most basins around the world are today at unprecedented low levels of activity and we expect to see a broad-based increase in investments going forward funded by higher oil prices. The magnitude and sustainability of the investment increase will, however, be a function of the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain in each basin and country which will vary significantly. Third, our deep local knowledge, the breadth and depth of our technology offering together with our geographical scale will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. And fourth, the shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the entire industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance, including intrinsic quality and efficiency, technology system innovations, and more aligned and collaborative business models, and Schlumberger is and will remain at the absolute forefront of this industry transformation. That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given to you at that time. And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2016 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to materially differ from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filings and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. I'll now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share was $0.40. Excluding charges recorded in the first and fourth quarters of last year, this represents decreases of $0.25 sequentially and $0.66 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our first quarter revenue of $6.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margin decreased 281 basis points to 14%. These decreases, which were driven by continued activity decline and pricing pressures, resulted in decremental margins of 32%. Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 20% sequentially while margin decreased 480 basis points to 19%, resulting in decremental margins of 43%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower software sales and a hold in higher-margin exploration activity. Drilling Group revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially while margin declined 183 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by activity declines across all areas. Despite these declines, decremental margins were limited to 27% on strong cost controls. Production Group revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 11% sequentially and margins fell by 335 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and further pricing erosion in North America land. These declines, offset in part by strong contributions from SPM [Schlumberger Production Management], resulted in decremental margins of 33%. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate [ETR] excluding charges and credits was 16% in the first quarter compared to 18% in the previous quarter. This decrease was largely driven by the significant sequential drop in pre-tax operating income we experienced in our North America business. With these reduced overall levels of pre-tax income that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax expense line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR. This can make our ETR more volatile as compared to prior years. Looking forward, the acquisition of Cameron is not expected to have a material impact on our overall ETR. However, due to the sensitivity of the overall geographic earnings mix of the combined business, we do expect an increase in the ETR for the rest of the year as compared to the first quarter. We generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation; as well, the payment of $260 million in severance during the quarter. Our net debt increased $1.1 billion during the quarter to $6.7 billion. We ended the quarter was total cash and investments of $14.8 billion. Cameron had $2.2 billion of cash at closing, and we paid the Cameron shareholders $2.8 billion in connection with the transaction. Therefore, we effectively started off the quarter with $14.2 billion of total cash and investments. During the quarter, we spent $475 million to repurchase 7.1 million shares at an average price of $67.43. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included: roughly $550 million on CapEx; $600 million of SPM investments; $170 million of multi-client; and $630 million of dividend payments. Excluding the impact of Cameron, full-year 2015 CapEx is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. This amount does not include investments in SPM or multi-client. Cameron's full-year 2016 CapEx is expected to be approximately $200 million, of which $37 million was spent during the first quarter. Let me take a few minutes to provide some additional financial details relating to the Cameron acquisition, which as you know closed on April 1. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we assumed gross debt with a carrying value of $2.8 billion. During April, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of this debt. This combined with the effect of the purchase accounting adjustment to fair value of the debt will result in Schlumberger's pre-tax net interest cost increasing by approximately $13 million per quarter starting in Q2. We still expect pre-tax synergies to be approximately $300 million over the next 12 months and $600 million in the second year. These numbers consist primarily of costs as opposed to revenue synergies in the first couple of years. However, we remain most excited about the opportunities for revenue synergies, which are very significant and expected to grow considerably in the future year. Although we are in the process of finalizing our purchase accounting, we estimate that the pre-tax amortization expense as a result of fair value adjustment to the acquired assets will add approximately $65 million on a quarterly basis to our corporate and other expense line. The transaction will be accretive on both an EPS and cash flow basis within the current year. As a reminder, going forward we will be incurring merger and integration-related charges. These will include transaction costs, the cost of integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustments, as well as costs to achieve synergies. These will be most significant in Q2, but they will continue for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. We will separately call out these charges for you as they are incurred. One last item is how we will report Cameron going forward. Since the acquisition of Smith five years ago, our groups have served as the primary reporting for SEC purposes. Starting in Q2, Cameron will become the fourth group in the structure, along with our existing Reservoir Characterization, Drilling, and Production groups. Additionally, the revenue of these four groups will be combined and reported consistent with Schlumberger's current area structure. However, this will only be revenue reporting, as we will no longer report operating income by area. Paal will further elaborate on the rationale for this change. Shortly after this call, we will be posting pro forma quarterly financial information in this format going back to Q1 2013, taking you through Q1 of 2016. And now I will turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Think you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Activity fell sharply in the first quarter, as the industry displayed clear signs of facing a full-scale cash crisis. We experienced activity reductions worldwide, with the rate of disruption reaching unprecedented levels. The start of a new year and a new budget cycle represented a further fall in customer E&P spend, and we expect continued weakening in the second quarter given the magnitude and erratic nature of the ongoing activity disruptions. This outlook is backed by the latest 2016 E&P spending surveys, which indicate sharper falls than earlier figures. Global spending reductions in 2016 are now approaching 25%, corresponding to a fall of 40% to 50% in North America and around 20% in the international markets. Our first quarter revenue fell 16% sequentially, a figure that represents the second steepest quarterly decline we have seen in this downturn that has now persisted for six straight quarters. Rig activity fell in all parts of the world, as customers further reduced budgets and continued to exert pressure on product and service pricing, while operations also suffered from project delays and job cancellations. In North America, revenue fell 25% sequentially, as the U.S. land rig count declined by 31%. By the end of the quarter, the U.S. land rig count had fallen to around 400, representing a drop of 80% from the peak of October 2014, and marking a third phase of a downturn that is the most severe the industry has seen in 30 years. The latest fall in activity has been particularly steep, as seen by our North America land revenues, which is 29% lower sequentially on reduced activity and increased pricing pressure, together with the early onset of the Canadian spring breakup. In spite of this downward acceleration in activity, our new technology sales remain solid, and we also see growing customer recognition for the value of our integrated technology offering. North America offshore revenue was down 18% sequentially, driven by lower rig activity and project delays and cancellations. In addition, multi-client seismic sales saw unprecedented low levels, resulting in a negative operating income of $36 million in the first quarter, due to the ongoing amortization of our multi-client library. This loss combined with the dramatic drop in activity and continued pricing pressure caused our overall operating margins in North America to fall into negative territory. Throughout the quarter, we maintained our focus on tailoring costs and resources to activity levels while safeguarding our operational infrastructure and technical capabilities. Needless to say, this approach further reduced our profitability levels. However, our cash flow in North America still remained positive. Turning to the international markets, revenue was 13% lower sequentially, as customer budget cuts, project cancellations, seasonal winter slowdowns, and foreign exchange weakness versus the U.S. dollar all impacted results. Fourth quarter international operating margins slipped to 21%, driven by the significant activity reductions and persistent pricing pressure. The Europe, CIS, and Africa [ECA] area was the worst affected, while the Latin America and the Middle East and Asia [MEA] areas were able to maintain flat margins compared to the fourth quarter. And in total, our international sequential decremental margins improved in the first quarter to 27%. Looking at the international areas in more detail, revenue in Latin America declined 9% sequentially while pre-tax operating margins remained steady at 23%, driven by proactive cost management initiated in the previous quarter and the startup of a new integrated project. In Argentina, activity softened further in the first quarter, and revenue was also negatively impacted by the weakening of the peso. Activity in Brazil and Colombia continues to be in freefall and was in the first quarter down 50% and 75% respectively compared to the first quarter of last year. In Ecuador, we are executing well on our SPM projects, with production in Shushufindi exceeding 90,000 barrels per day during the first quarter. And we continue to invest actively in our integration project in the country. Revenue in Venezuela was down sequentially, but we did see higher activity in the Faja joint ventures compared to the fourth quarter. In Venezuela, the rate of cash collections has been insufficient in recent quarters. And in spite of concerted efforts together with our main customer, we have been unable to establish new mechanisms that address this issue. Therefore, as we have already announced, we have decided that we will not increase our accounts receivable balance beyond the level reached at the end of the first quarter. This means that activity levels in Venezuela going forward will be aligned with the rate of cash collections from our customers in the country. In doing this, we are working in close coordination with all customers in Venezuela to continue to serve the ones with available cash flow and to ensure a safe and orderly wind-down of operations for the others. We have been working in Venezuela since 1929. And in spite of this temporary reduction in activity, we remain committed to the oil and gas industry in the country going forward. In Europe, CIS, and Africa, revenues fell 18% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins dropped by 194 basis points to 19%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble and the seasonal winter slowdown both on land and offshore impacted results. In the North Sea, revenue was also lower due to customer budget cuts, seasonal reductions in activity, and also severe weather conditions, while widespread project delays and job cancellations in sub-Saharan Africa contributed to another significant sequential reduction in revenue in this region. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue declined by 11% sequentially while pre-tax operating margins remained flat at 22%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia, with lower activity in China from the seasonal winter slowdown and also by weaker activity in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region as a result of continued customer budget cuts. First quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East region, where solid activity in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region. In terms of operating margins, the lower activity and pricing pressure seen throughout the area was offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base as well as by further implementation of our transformation program. Turning now to our technology offering, the Cameron transaction closed on April 1, 2016. And on this date, Cameron became the fourth Schlumberger product group, joining our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling, and Production groups. We are very excited and pleased to welcome the Cameron employees under the leadership of Scott Rowe to Schlumberger. And we are already in full implementation mode of the detailed integration plans we have jointly prepared over the past seven months. In terms of financial reporting, Simon has already explained that we will report Cameron financial results as a fourth global group, and also that Cameron's revenue will be consolidated with the rest of the company on a geographical basis under the four reporting areas we currently disclose, while we at the same time will discontinue the geographical reporting of pre-tax operating income. So let me explain the reasoning behind this change. First, the Cameron Group is a centrally run manufacturing business built around large plants that address global markets, and their customer billings around the world are largely separated from where the costs are incurred. Combining the Cameron Group revenue with the rest of the company will therefore give a good representation of customer activity for the entire company. However, Cameron has historically not allocated out a large central cost base because managing these allocations are associated with significant extra workloads. At the same time the traditional Schlumberger business, although different in nature from Cameron, is also evolving towards a more regional and central setup as part of our ongoing corporate transformation. Our geographical presence from both a customer interaction and well site execution standpoint will never change and will always remain central to how we run the company. However, the overhead structure that is employed to support our day-to-day customer operations represents a significant part of our cost base, which can be dramatically streamlined and reduced through the centralization drive of the transformation program. Schlumberger is therefore also on a path where there is a growing distance between where we bill our customers and where we incur a large part of our costs. Based on this, we have therefore decided to discontinue the reporting of pre-tax operating income by the geographical areas. Beyond this, we will continue to report orders and backlog for the Cameron long-cycle businesses, of OneSubsea and Drilling, and for the WesternGeco seismic business. Next, let's move on from financial reporting to new technology. The technical driver behind the Cameron transaction is our belief that the Cameron technologies will be critical enablers in the development of a new generation of incubated surface and subsurface systems that have the potential to make a step change in both drilling and production performance. One example of this is our land drilling system of the future that brings together purpose-built surface and downhole hardware, which is ready to be integrated into a complete drilling system, overseen and managed by a common optimization software that will deliver a step change in operational efficiency. Cameron brings expertise and technology in the areas of top drives, pipe handling systems, and blowout preventers, while the new system will also draw on the rig design acquisition and rig manufacturing JV we made last year. Five engineering prototypes of the new system will be ready for field testing in 2016 in Ecuador and the U.S., with full commercial introduction on track for 2017. Another example is our new hydraulic fracturing system, which will be produced in 2017, where we will bring together new hardware technologies and significant process reengineering as well as a common operating and optimization software. This system will span the complete range of surface components, such as Cameron's CAMSHALE pressure control and wellhead systems together with our own perforating, fracturing, cleanup, and flowback services, as well as our latest downhole completion technology and fracturing fluids. Both of these systems will initially be deployed within our current CapEx budget of $2 billion for 2016, which itself has been reduced by $400 million from our initial guidance. Our ability to invest through this unprecedented industry downturn on the back of our strong cash flow and balance sheet enables us to capitalize on the current market conditions to gain significant relative strength compared to our surroundings. In addition to our traditional CapEx investments, we also continue to invest in new production management projects, leveraging our broad subsurface and integration capabilities. An example of this is the Auca project we started off in Ecuador during the first quarter, where we are building further on the highly successful Shushufindi project, which is now in its fifth year of operation. Multi-client seismic surveys is another line of business opportunities we continue to invest in, where our current focus is on the exciting Campeche Basin in Mexico and the largely unexplored areas offshore Mozambique and South Africa. As we enter the second quarter, we have a total of eight 3D vessels active, and with three of these using our unique IsoMetrix technology. We also continue to make M&A investments in niche technologies that fill gaps in our portfolio or in our ability to develop specific new services. We mentioned two of these in today's release, with one being a novel downhole metal-to-metal sealing technology for use in our completions product line, while the other brings expert consulting abilities in support of the expansion of our integrated project portfolio. And finally, we continue to focus on returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, which combined amounted to $1.1 billion in the first quarter. Turning now to the short-term outlook, we expect market conditions to worsen further in the second quarter, as customers continue to reduce activity. Excluding the additional revenue from Cameron, this market outlook together with our decision to reduce activity in Venezuela could lead to a sequential percentage fall in revenue for the second quarter, similar to what we saw in Q1. Cameron revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be flat sequentially. In this environment, we will continue to tailor service capacity and overhead costs to activity levels while preserving long-term operational and technical capabilities, which could represent a further burden on our operating margins going forward, in particular in North America. Our overall view of the oil markets, however, remains unchanged, where a steady tightening of the supply and demand balance is taking place. The latest reports confirm that 2016 demand growth remains solid, while OPEC production levels have been largely flat since the mid of 2015. Production in North America continues to fall as decline rates are becoming more pronounced, while the mature non-OPEC production is now falling in a number of regions. As we navigate these landscapes, a number of positive factors make me optimistic and confident with respect to Schlumberger's future. First, the magnitude of the E&P investment cuts are now so severe that it can only accelerate production decline and the consequent upward movement in oil price. Second, our financial strength enables us to continue to invest in a range of opportunities across a number of our businesses. Third, the massive capacity reductions in the service industry will help restore a good part of the international pricing concessions we have made once oil prices and activity levels start to normalize. And last, while we have reduced capacity significantly, we are safeguarding the core expertise and capabilities of the company beyond our immediate operational requirements. We therefore remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings. Through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering, the strategic moves we have made, and our corporate transformation program, we are creating the leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share and continue to produce superior earnings and margins. Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much and thanks for a good rundown there, Paal. Our CapEx numbers agree very closely with those you outlined. But despite that, at least here within Morgan Stanley, we have a pretty big debate about the exact timing and the expected impact of these cuts on production. I think U.S. and the Middle East is getting extremely well understood, but I'd be very grateful if you could share your insights on some of those areas, so the role that have headline rig counts that have gone down 80% – 90% in many cases, but very little data available. So what's your take on what's going on across some of the key Latin American markets or West Africa or let's say China? If you can, give us a high-level – without mentioning any specific country or customer of course, some insights into what gives you confidence that the markets are rebalancing.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: What I would say, you look at non-OPEC production outside of North America, it is very clear that it's now in full decline. If you look at non-OPEC production overall, it drops by 930,000 barrels over the course of Q1. About 50% of this was North America, and the other half was international non-OPEC. The leading driver outside of the U.S. in terms of this production drop is seen in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, the UK, and in China. So 930,000 barrels of drop over the course of Q1 is quite significant, and non-OPEC production is now already 400,000 barrels a day down year over year. So based on this, we believe that the current oversupply is expected to shrink to almost zero by the end of 2016. And in Q4 this year, non-OPEC production is now forecasted to be down 1 million barrels per day year over year. So that basically increases the call on OPEC from today's level to Q4 by 1.8 million barrels a day, which is quite a significant increase. So yes, we believe and I think we agree with you that the oil market is in the process of balancing.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That does sound like some big numbers. What would it take in your view – eventually the industry is going to have to go back to work again because once we undershoot on the supply side, prices will take care of that. But what will it take in order to stabilize and grow production again globally given the contraction we've seen, as you highlighted, in service capacity and the lag between investments and – or lack of investments for that matter and production?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think we will need significant increases in E&P investment. There's no way you can get around that. But if you look at the current state of the industry today and you look forward to 2017, there are limited sources of short-term supply that can be brought to the market. What can be done next year is to draw down further on global stocks. There is OPEC spare capacity that can be put into the market. We have the North America land ducts. And if you look at new investments that are relatively short cycle, there are two sources of that. It is going to be the conventional land international, and it's going to be the unconventional land in North America. Both of these resource types are relatively short-cycle businesses, and production coming out of them is just going to be a function of the investment appetite. So I think the sources of additional production for 2017 is limited to these items that I just mentioned. And beyond that, I think we need a widespread significant increase in E&P investments to get supply back to where it can meet growing demand.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you very much.
Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Ole.
Operator: We'll go to the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, Paal. In the past you've talked about the massive overcapacity in land service markets and talked about the pricing recovery in the short to medium term looks really difficult. Some of the smaller peers have been talking about stacked capacity permanently impaired in North America, so maybe the market is a little tighter than it looks. So in your mind and as we think about the lag effects that you've talked about here, how does that look for you, the outlook on pricing and how that utilization and the capacity can all work together?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: For North America?
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, in North America. I'm just curious if you think that some of that stacked capacity doesn't come back and how that portends to margins.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think it would be great if it didn't come back, but I still think most of it is going to come back. I think some of it today probably isn't operational because it needs maintenance. But I think when activity starts to increase, most of this equipment through some maintenance investment can be brought back in. And that's why I still believe there's a large capacity overhang in North America land. And with the current depressed service pricing, we need significant pricing increases to get back in to generate profits in North America land. And that's why I don't think that pricing traction is going to be significant in the short term, and that's why also I think the earnings contributions from North America land is going to be a bit out in time.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And as we talk about decrementals and how those look for you, your decrementals have held up remarkably well here. But you also talk about preserving your core capabilities. Are we getting to the end of cost-cutting here, and would you expect decrementals to get maybe a little bit worse here before it starts turning the corner?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You're right, it is increasingly difficult to maintain decrementals around the 30% mark. We did 32% even with the massive surprise we had in the first quarter. But yes, we are getting to the point where some of our technical capabilities, which take a long time to develop, we are going to revamp those and not cut them to be in line with current activity levels. But with that said, on the field capacity, we continue to tailor that to ongoing activity levels. This can be rebuilt within, I would say, plus or minus 12 months. What we are currently undergoing now is a detailed review of our overhead structure to see whether there is an opportunity to bring that further down, but that wouldn't be done to serve the next couple of quarters, it would be basically finding a way that we can lighten that burden more permanently. But to do that, it requires significant review, and that's the process we're currently going through at this stage.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Your line is open.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: So there has been a lot of discussion out in the marketplace about people and the challenges with people. And if you could, give us a little bit of color on what steps you've taken to retain your top talent, both internationally but also more importantly in the U.S., and then your thoughts on your ability to bring these new people back in or bring back your old people back in when things do slowly start to turn around in 2017.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Maybe I can just start by one thing first. So if you look at our reported head count numbers, we reported at the end of Q4 95,000 people, and we reported 93,000 people at this stage, which indicates that we let go another 2,000 people during Q1. We actually released another 8,000 people during the first quarter. So we have now reduced our workforce by around 42,000 people from the peak in 2014. So the delta here is that we are now counting around 5,500 contractors which were previously not considered part of our permanent head count, so a drop of 8,000 in Q1. Now to your question around how we are managing this, we are obviously right-sizing field capacity continuously. This capacity, we can build back relatively quickly, probably within 12 months. But even in the field capacity, we have introduced a program called intent of leave of absence. And here for our senior field engineers and for key operational people, we are giving them basically half an annual salary, paid 20% up front when they take this leave of absence, and 30% of the salary is paid when they return back after 12 months. And we have several batches of this incentivized leave of absence where we can call people back in the coming 12 to 18 months. So that's a key part of how we preserve some of our core operational expertise. And then on the overhead and support structure, we continue to look at right-sizing that. But in this, our technical support organization, which takes a long time to develop, we are also ring fencing that to take sure that we have these people available as we get back into growth mode.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Okay, that was very helpful. And then you mentioned and you gave a little bit of color on your preservation of your core capabilities, but also a greater willingness to balance market share with profitability. Maybe a little bit more color there, particularly on the U.S. but internationally as well, and you referenced obviously still some pressure on revenues and margins going into Q2. And can you talk a little bit more how that plays out for the next quarter or two on the margin side?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Q2 is going to be another very tough quarter. So the significant drop in activity that we saw during the first quarter is obviously now spilling over into Q2. In addition to that, we're going to have the impact on Venezuela to deal with. So again, we are expecting a significant percentage drop in revenue going into Q2, which again will make it difficult or challenging to maintain decremental margins around 30%, although we are going to continue to try. What we see in certain markets and certain basins in North America and also certain markets international, that activity is coming down to basically critical mass type of levels. And at that stage, it is not only about focusing in on cost reductions and managing margins. We are also considering what the startup costs again would be in the event we have to shut everything down. So in certain cases, we are carrying, I would say, contracts and operations losses for certain regions where we believe that's a better investment than actually shutting down and then having the lag in time and significant costs to start things back up again. But this is a review we do for every country or every basin on a continuous basis, what's the benefit of taking the losses versus shutting down and then making the investments later on to start back up again.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Great, that was actually very helpful. Thank you, Paal.
Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Angie.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
James West - Evercore ISI: Thanks. Good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
James West - Evercore ISI: So I don't think we have much of a debate here at Evercore ISI on the structure of oil prices, but I'd love to get your thoughts on prices given that you've said recently in public documents you're looking at medium-for-longer. I guess what do you see as medium-for-longer? And then my follow-up would be what does that mean for activity improving for your businesses?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Our view on the medium-for-longer or the background for that statement is that I think that is the pricing level that the industry has and has to live with, and it's probably the pricing level that some of the core parts of OPEC is also believing is a reasonable target, although they have not told us, so that is our assumption. So in that environment, there is still a big jump for the industry to make sure that we can bring cost per barrel down to make projects viable in these pricing ranges as well as having enough projects to generate supply to meet future demand. So it is an opportunity for a company like ourselves to work closely with our customers in collaborative ways, where we look at jointly with them driving costs out of the system and production up from the assets that they have. And I think by having this focus, there is an opportunity for the industry to be quite successful in the medium-for-longer scenario. But we cannot continue to operate in the same way that we have done in the past. So we see significant opportunity for Schlumberger in that type of scenario, but it requires the industry to change both in the level of collaboration between customers and the service industry, as well as new investments in more efficient processes, better quality, and very importantly, total system innovation to drive performance.
James West - Evercore ISI: Paal, are you seeing that collaboration come through during this down cycle? Are you seeing more evidence from your customers to actually collaborate more with you?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: There are some signs of it, James, but I wouldn't say it's prevalent or significant at this stage. We are obviously very interested in starting it. We have some small projects going on with some key customers. In fairness to our customers as well, they are in a very, I would say, significant cash crunch at this stage, in which case the priority for them would have to be to navigate that through before they start changing their business model. But I think there is an openness and willingness when things settle here to move in towards more collaborative relationships, and we are certainly ready to lead that.
James West - Evercore ISI: Got it. Thanks, Paal.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): A little bit of a shift, I figure that about 25% to 30% of your operating income these days are coming from offshore and primarily deepwater work. And I'm in Washington at the NOIA [National Ocean Industries Association] meeting. And the consensus here seems to be that deepwater is going to decline or at least not begin to recover for at least the next couple years. You all have given us a great deal of view and guidance on the onshore outlook. Can you talk a little bit about the offshore outlook?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's fair to say that in terms of significant new projects being sanctioned offshore, I think that is not going to be the first area that our customers are going to start putting money into. So I think it's fair to say that the land part of the global operations will see higher investments before the offshore, and in particular the deepwater part. Now as to the percentage of our revenue and earnings, we haven't disclosed what deepwater and offshore is. But I would say that the current operating income we're getting from this part of our business is I would say significantly or massively reduced from what it was in more of a stable operating environment in 2014. So a lot of these hits I believe we have already taken. It still means that we have upside potential when these investments start. But we also have a very good presence, both in North America land and even more so in the international land conventional market. So in any situation where the investments are coming, and they would have to come, we are very well positioned to capture our share of them and generate earnings growth from the onset of the increase. And then the offshore and deepwater comes later on and exploration coming after that. We have several new phases that can spur our growth in the coming two, three, four years.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, Paal, I appreciate that. And my follow-up if I could, when we talk about international conventional and domestic unconventional, it would appear just from customer spending patterns that onshore U.S. and the independents will probably come back first. Will there be much of a delay, and if so, how much between the recovery in North America and the recovery on international conventional land?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's a good question, Jim. I think if you go on historical ways of responding, I think it's right to say that in previous small and large downturns, the North American players have been quicker and had more investment appetite to grow fast. I think the situation at this stage is somewhat different. There is a potential significant supply challenge over the next couple of years, and part of this will have to be addressed through international increased supply. So I think a number of the players within the Middle East, I think Russia land and Russian Siberia all have the capacity I think to invest more and have a short-cycle impact on production. Now whether they will do that or not I think is still to be seen. But I think given the potential challenges of supply, I don't think North America by itself is going to be able to handle it. It would have to come from other sources as well, in which case I think this time around you would probably see a faster response, in my view, from the international conventional land businesses as well.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you very much.
Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is open.
William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International: Thank you, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International: Paal, I was curious as to your views with regard to the threshold oil price required to drive 2017 international E&P capital spending growth.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's going to be gradual. I don't think there's going to be one magical number.
William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International: Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think oil prices now for Brent being already in the mid-$40s is a positive sign. Still, we maintain our view that there's going to be a lag between oil price and increases and significant increases in E&P spend. And I think our customers will take a cautious view on how much they're going to spend as well, given the balance sheet state of many of them and also the significant volatility that you might also see going forward. So I think you will see a gradual comeback of investments as oil prices increase, we believe, over the course of the second half of this year. And then it's going to be I think a function maybe of how severe the supply situation is going to be. I think that might be a good guide in addition to the movement of the oil price because if supply is clearly weakening, I think it's going to be much safer to increase investments going forward as well, in which case the appetite might come up together with the oil price. So I think our customers will take a balanced but conservative view initially. And I think the appetite might increase as we see how severe the impact on supply is going to be as the rest of this year evolves.
William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International: I guess the question is that in the event that we continue to get an improvement in oil prices, although the rate of improvement slows over the back half of the year, that it begins to crystallize that we're on a sustainable path to recovery. Do we need considerably higher oil prices from this point to drive decent E&P capital spending growth internationally in 2017, or is it sufficient that we're on a recovery path and resource holders continue to believe that the direction is higher and not lower?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It's difficult to generalize, but I think your statement around the path I think is going to be critical as well, the path of supply and the path of movement of oil price. Like I said, it's difficult to come up with one specific number. I think the various customer groups and the customers within these groups will have different views on when they are getting comfortable to invest. But I would think both aspects, the oil price movement and the supply trends, is probably what they're going to look at when they make decisions. But overall, as I said earlier on the call, E&P investments will have to come up in order to address the supply challenges we'll see in 2017 and onwards.
William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International: Okay, thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Paal, you had mentioned that international pricing concessions that you've given would start to go away as oil prices rise. I guess that's what you said. Would we start to see that at $60 per barrel Brent, or do we need higher prices to see those pricing concessions go away?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I wouldn't tie it to a specific oil price. I would more tie it to activity levels. I think that's what's going to drive our pricing. And that's again, we see a lag between the move in oil price and E&P investments and our activity. But I think if there is a start of a third or at least a noticeable uptick in international activity, I think some of these pricing concessions that have been made, we should be able to get part of them back. And in fact, in many of our contracts, the concessions we have made are either time-limited or they are tied to oil price figures as well. So based on all of this, we believe that some of the pricing at least we will get back.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great, and then secondly, my follow-up on your SPM investments. How are the returns on your SPM investments relative to the overall corporate returns? Are they higher or lower? And then how does that differential change through the cycle?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Simon?
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'm going to take this question, Waqar. So normally, our SPM investments and our review of these projects, they are superior to our normal activity. That's the reason why we have developed this type of business, and it is even during the cycles it's giving us a baseline of activity that produces higher margins and higher returns. But you have to remember that this is a long-term project. And in the beginning the model, that it is a negative cash flow, which turns into a positive cash flow after a while. So over a cycle, yes, it is better return and better margins.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Now you mentioned almost $600 million in the quarter in SPM. What are your plans for the remainder of this year in terms of SPM investments?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think if you look at both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year, SPM investments have been higher than what you've seen before, and we expect the second quarter to go back into more of a level that you've seen preceding these two latest quarters.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Paal, if I could ask you, you mentioned briefly in your prepared comments that you could – the way the market is going, you could see revenue in the second quarter potentially decline by the same amount as the first quarter. It sounds like Latin America, it would stand to reason, could be worse because of Venezuela. Would you see a material difference amongst the regions in revenue decline to get to the same percentage decline, or is there more of a shift to one area or the other in terms of the decline in revenue from 1Q to 2Q?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think if you look at the four areas, we'll see again a significant drop in North America, purely based on how the rig count has fared over the course of Q1. In Latin America, as you point out, we will have a significant impact on Venezuela, where we are in the process of tailoring activity to the rate of collections, which will mean a fairly significant drop in activity in Venezuela in Q2. And just for the record, I'd just like to also say that our receivable balance in Venezuela at the end of the first quarter was around $1.2 billion, and our revenue in Venezuela was less than 5% of the total for the first quarter and also for the full year of last year, just to give you some perspective of the situation there. Then going to ECA and to MEA, I don't have the details of the projections there, but I think you would see a similar type of revenue headwinds also going into the second quarter there as well.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess trying to think about decremental margins on a similar revenue decline, do we think we can perhaps get a little bit better decrementals, or does Venezuela cause decrementals to maybe deteriorate a little bit from what you were able to do in the first quarter?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We've laid out the ambition of trying to keep decrementals around 30% since the start of this downturn, which was a lot easier to do five, six quarters ago than what it is to do currently. And obviously, when you have shutdown of significant operations in a large country like Venezuela, it is much more difficult to deal with because, for instance, in Venezuela, we are going to keep a large part of our local organization employed and on the payroll as we go forward. And also we keep our entire asset base in the country to make sure that we are ready to go back and serve our customers there once cash flow is available to pay us. So there are certain of these decisions that we are making now which are somewhat headwinds to decrementals, but I would say that our ambition is still to try to fight this out and deliver at least close to 30% decrementals, although I cannot promise it.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you, Paal. Appreciate it.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great rundown so far, Paal. I was wondering. You mentioned two things about the international, the call on international oil coming from the international markets, part of that coming from OPEC and then you also indicated Russia. Can you give us a little bit more color around Russia? There seems to be a lot of discussion in the marketplace that neither Russia nor Saudi in particular can increase output from where they are currently. Your comments seem to counter that viewpoint. So can you just give us some views on Russia in particular?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think if you look at Russia throughout this downturn, activity has been very strong, and they have done a good job from the oil industry in the country to keep production up between 10.5 million and 11 million barrels per day. So in spite of the challenges we have in Russia with the ruble and then the overall situation there, we've seen strong underlying activity and a very strong focus from the country and from the industry in the country to maintain and even try to increase production slightly. So I think through higher investments, obviously Russia has significant oil and gas reserves. And to increase investments, if there's an appetite to do that, I still think Russia has the potential to increase production yet going forward.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And I think to your comment on Saudi as well, obviously Saudi is sitting on several million barrels of spare capacity, which they can put into the market if they so choose to.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great, and then just a quick follow-up on Cameron. I fully understand your business plan and business model on integrating the hardware with the reservoir dynamics. What has been the uptake on that? Have you had some definitive successes on selling that business model to the oil companies as of yet?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's still early days on that. I think the overall concept I think is widely accepted. This whole focus on total system innovation going forward, combining hardware with sensors, instrumentation, and software controls, this is the way of the future for the industry. So I still think it's early days. We are seeing some traction in OneSubsea, which has obviously been at this for several years already, and also things around the Rig of the Future system I explained. I think it will be quite interesting when we also roll out our new frac system in 2017. So we have a lot of investments already going on, which means that it's not going to be years before you see the impact of what we are talking about. I think I would expect there to be already some impact in 2016 and even more so in 2017 to introduce these new technology systems.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right, that's great. Appreciate that color.
Operator: Thank you. And we have time for one last question, and that will be from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in and good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Paal, in the release you highlighted that you're cautious regarding adding capacity in North America once recovery begins, which I think you highlighted reflects a cautious stance regarding your views towards long-term oversupply and hence profitability. But on the other hand, it appears that you have a good ability to take share in the U.S. given the financial stress being experienced by your smaller competitors. Can you just walk through that strategy a little bit more regarding balancing market share on U.S. land and expanding the U.S. business at what initially would be thin margins? Why not be aggressive during the initial recovery in terms of reactivating equipment to take share and then have greater share when profitability levels can improve later on?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That's a fair question. I would say our general philosophy is that we do like not like contracts that are dilutive to earnings. So basically, losing money isn't something that we ideally want to get into. Now we take on contracts at this stage of the cycle that are dilutive to earnings per share if we believe that doing that is going to serve us long term either from a share standpoint or from keeping our capabilities intact as we work through the trough of the cycle. So in terms of being cautious and adding back capacity, if we are talking about being in the black and basically making profits, I have no issues at all releasing capacity and going for share. But if the share is associated with negative earnings, that's when we're going to be cautious and we're going to stick to basically preserving capabilities and infrastructure as long as pricing levels are at that stage. But I think as soon as you get into the black, we are quite keen to unleash all of the capacity we have available to gain share.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And then it's my understanding that those frac crews in the U.S. are underutilized today even when active. Do you have an idea of roughly how much more you can expand your frac workload in the U.S. without actually reactivating spreads?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The spreads we have today are actually quite well utilized because if you have – with the current pricing levels, if you have poor utilization on top of it, it is a disaster from a profitability standpoint. So the fleets we have in operations are actually today reasonably well utilized. So there might be some upside in capacity on it, but I wouldn't say significant. We would have to reactivate new capacity in order to take on significantly more work.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great, thanks.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much. So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the most important points that we discussed. First, our industry is now in the deepest financial crisis on record, with profitability and cash flow at unsustainable levels for most oil and gas operators. This has created an equally dramatic situation for the service industry. Each successive quarter for the past 18 months has brought increasing cost in E&P spend that have led to falling activity and lower demand for oilfield products and services. This is the toughest environment we have seen for 30 years, and it is likely to get even tougher before the market turns. Second, so far in this downturn, we have successfully managed a very challenging commercial landscape by balancing margins against market share and aggressively reducing capacity and overhead costs. In parallel, we continue to focus on how to best preserve the long-term technical capabilities of the company. This approach together with the benefits of our ongoing transformation program has enabled us to outperform our surroundings and protect our financial strength. And third, the current market presents significant opportunities for companies that have both the required capital and strategic bandwidth that enables them to invest. In this respect so far in this downturn, we have closed our largest ever acquisition, made a series of smaller but still significant investments in specific technology niches, and invested in integrated services and projects that will boost our financial performance going forward. We are also actively investing in pre-funded multi-client seismic surveys that will underpin a return to solid exploration activity in several regions around the world. And we also regard the protection of our technical capabilities as well as our immediate operational needs as an investment in our future growth. In summary, we remain convinced that the tightening of the supply/demand balance is well underway. And while the operating environment remains tough, the market presents a range of opportunities which we will continue to actively pursue. Thank you very much for listening in today.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I’d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release which is on our Web site. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. I’ll now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits, was $0.65. This represent decreases of $0.13 sequentially and $0.85 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter we reported $2.1 billion of pre-tax charges. These charges are the direct result of the very challenging market conditions we’re operating in and they include severance, impairment, and restructuring charges. The asset impairment charges largely relate to our North America business, which as you know has been the hardest hit during this downturn. All of these charges are described in detail in our earnings press release. Our fourth quarter revenue of $7.7 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Approximately one-third of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment, both in terms of pricing and activity, pre-tax operating margins only declined by 132 basis points sequentially to 16.6%. This was due to continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. Sequential highlights by product group whereas follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 7% sequentially, while margins decreased 230 basis points to 24.2%. These declines were due to decreases in exploration spending that largely impacted wireline internationally. We also did not see the year-end surge in multiclient and software sales that we typically experience in Q4. Drilling Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 8%, primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected drilling and measurements and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 173 basis points to 16.7%. Production Group revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 10% primarily due to the continued decline in land activity and further pricing pressure in North America. Production Group margins were essentially flat at 11.3% as SPM projects and higher earnings from our investments in OneSubsea compensated for the effects of the lower activity and pricing pressure. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 18.2% in the fourth quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 2 percentage points. This decrease was largely due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the Rest of the World, as well as the favorable revolution of certain tax contingencies and an R&D credit during the quarter. Excluding the impact of Cameron, we expect the ETR in 2016 to be around 20%. On a pro-forma basis, we expect the combined Company ETR to be in the low 20s, although this would remain sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During all of 2015, we generated $8.8 billion of cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $800 million during 2015 and $200 million during the fourth quarter. In light of our strong cash flow generation, yesterday our Board of Directors approved a new $10 billion share buyback program. This new program will be effective once the remaining $1.4 billion of authorization under the current program is exhausted. During the quarter, our net debt deteriorated a $343 million to $5.5 billion as we continue to invest in future revenue streams. During the fourth quarter, we spend $627 million on CapEx and invested approximately $600 million in SPM projects and $150 million in multiclient projects. Full-year 2016 CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM investments is expected to be around $2.4 billion. During the quarter, we spend $398 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares at an average price of $73.86. This is despite being prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our shares for about one month prior to the Cameron shareholder vote. Let me take this opportunity to talk a little bit about the Cameron transaction. In order to ensure an efficient capital structure within the group, Schlumberger Holding Corporation, our principal U.S subsidiary that we will also refer as SHC, is the legal entity that will acquire Cameron. SHC will acquire approximately 137 million shares of common stock from its parent and transfer these shares to Cameron shareholders. SHC will also pay cash of approximately $2.8 billion in connection with this transaction. During the fourth quarter, SHC issued $6 billion of notes. These notes have the weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.15% and have maturities to ranging from 2017 to 2025. SHC will use the proceeds from this debt issuance to partially fund the purchase of the 137 million shares from the parent company. SHC will then use a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings to finance the difference between the proceeds received from the issuance of these notes and the cash required to complete the Cameron merger. As a result of this debt issuance, Schlumberger’s pre-tax interest expense will increase approximately $40 million in Q1 as compared to Q4. As we close the Cameron transaction, we will begin to incur merger and integration related costs. These will include transaction costs, the cost of the integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustments, as well as one-off cost to achieve the synergies. These amounts will be most significant in the quarter the transaction closes and the quarters immediately following the merger. We will separately call out these charges for you as are incurred. And now I will turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you Simon and good morning everyone. Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter with global oil production of oil continuing, extending the various trend in global oil inventories and causing a further fall in oil prices, which reach a 12-year low in December. The worsening market conditions added further pressure to the deep financial crisis throughout the oil and gas value chain and prompt the operators to make further cuts to the already low E&P investment levels. For many of our customers, available cash and annual budgets were exhausted well before the half way point over the fourth quarter, leading to unscheduled and abrupt activity cancellations, creating an operating environment that is increasingly complex to navigate and where the traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales were largely muted. As planned we implemented another significant adjustment to our cost and resource base during the fourth quarter, including the release of 10,000 employees as well as further streamlining of our overhead infrastructure and asset base. In spite of these significant structural adjustments, our overall fourth quarter results were in some areas impacted by events that were either outside of our control or where we chose to maintain cost and resource levels, pending availability of additional customer budgets in the New Year. However, as we exited the fourth quarter, I believe we’ve made the necessary adjustments to our cost and resource base and that we’re well positioned to continue to deliver solid financial results in both the first quarter and throughout 2016, which will clearly be another very challenging year for our industry. Looking closer at our fourth quarter results, global revenue fell 9% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations together with a broad range of activity disruptions, project delays and cancellations. In North America revenue was down 14% sequentially, which is inline with the reduction in the drilling rig counts and driven by exhausted customer budgets and cash flows together with the extended holiday period. Our North American pre-tax operating margins remain very resilient at 7.1% driven by proactive cost and resource management, excellent performance from our supply chain and distribution organization, strong execution and new technology sales from our operations, all of which were further supported by our transformation program. On land, in both U.S and Canada, the weakening activity resulted in additional commercial pressure for all product lines and in particular in pressure pumping where pricing levels drop further into unsustainable territory for both operating margins and cash flow. We also saw continuous pricing pressure and activity reductions in the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, as the drilling rig count drops by another 2% sequentially and where year-end multiclient seismic sales were largely muted. Turning to the international markets, revenue were 6% lower sequentially as customer budget cuts, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown, and the absence of the traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales all impacted results. Our fourth quarter international operating margins drop to 22%, driven by a further pricing pressure and unfavorable revenue mix and a significant impact of activity disruptions, particularly in the Middle East and Asia. In Latin America revenue declined 1% sequentially with pre-tax operating margins improving by 229 basis points to 23%. In terms of revenue, solid activity in Mexico and Ecuador was offset by a further budget reductions in Colombia and Brazil, while the weakening of the peso had a negative impact in our fourth quarter revenue in Argentina. Margins remain resilient across the area as the cost and resource base adjustments made during the previous quarter took full effect and as we continue to leverage our transformation program. This combination more than offset the persistent pricing pressure we saw throughout our customer base. In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue fell 9% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins dropped 138 basis points to 20.8%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown in Russia, and a noticeable reduction in activity throughout the Caspian region, all impacted the results. In Europe, activity in Norway was resilient, but this was more than offset by a significant reduction in continental Europe and U.K., while in Africa solid in Nigeria and Algeria was not enough to offset the further weakening in the Central and West Africa. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue declined by 5% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins decreased by 448 basis points to 22.5%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia where we saw a general weakening in activity throughout the region, which was most pronounced in Malaysia and Australia, where project ended and customer budgets were cut further. Fourth quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East, where solid activity in Kuwait and Iraq was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region. In terms of operating margins, pricing pressure across the area was only partly offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base and where project cancellations, delayed start off of new project, and activity disruptions due to 2015 budget limitations, all contributed to the sequential reduction in operating margins. Our fourth quarter results cap a year where we’ve faced the most severe industry downturn in 30 years, but where we through proactive management and strong execution, have shown that we can navigate the challenging operating environment better than most and produce solid financial results while maintaining the bandwidth to pursue and capitalize on opportunities that strengthen the competitive position of the Company. So as we prepare for another very challenging year, I’d like to summarize what we’ve delivered in 2015, as this sets a very good benchmark for our expectations and ambitions for the year to come. Looking first at the top line, full-year revenue dropped by 27% in 2015, driven by a 39% drop in North America where we’ve further strengthen our market position in spite of our decision not to pursue work that falls outside of our financial return requirements. Our international revenue fell by 21% in 2015, which is comparable to the drop in E&P investments. Included in this revenue drop is both the impact of our higher leverage towards the exploration, deepwater, and seismic markets, where E&P investment saw significantly higher reductions and also included the impact of the strong dollar against a number of foreign currencies. These revenue mix headwinds are fully absorbed in our results at this stage, which makes our international business a highly compressed coiled spring, which we will capitalize on when E&P investments and customer activity starts recovering. In addition to this, we’ve in the past year significantly increased our tender win rate, which further strengthens our very solid contracts portfolio and puts us in a great position to increase market share going forward. Looking at 2015 profitability, full-year global operating margins fell by only 342 basis points to 18.4%, as we maintained our wide margin lead in the international markets and as we now are also approaching a similar margin gap in North America. We’ve managed to protect our margins due to a very proactive approach to cost and resource management and by further accelerating our corporate transformation program. Together these actions have delivered detrimental margins of 31% in 2015, which is about half the level seen in previous downturns. Turning next to cash, our free cash flow in 2015 was about $5 billion, which represents net income conversion rate of 114%. This includes CapEx of $2.4 billion, which is now down to 59% of DNA, in addition to investments of $1.4 billion in future revenue streams in the areas of SPM and multiclient seismic. Our ability to generate free cash in this part of the cycle is unmatched in the oil field services industry and gives us a unique ability to capitalize on the significant business opportunities that the current market conditions present. From our free cash flow we’ve returned $4.6 billion of cash to our shareholders through $2.4 billion in dividend payments and $2.2 billion worth of stock buyback. In addition to this, we’ve spent about $500 million on M&A, where we continue to target smaller disruptive technology companies that we can integrate into our existing and future workflows and deploy through our expensive global organization. The strength of our free cash flow can also be seen from our net debt level which has only increased by $160 million on a full-year basis, driven by the financial performance I’ve just described. With respect to the pending Cameron transaction, the integration plans are now largely completed and we are fully ready for day one. We still expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2016, and we’ve already received antitrust approvals from the U.S., Canada, Russia, and Brazil. The fact that we structured the deal to include 78% of stock provides us with a necessary installation from the ongoing market turmoil and during the fourth quarter we also secured the required financing for our U.S entity that will make the acquisition. Turning next to people, we’ve in the past year unfortunately have to reduce more than 34,000 employees, which represents an unprecedented number for the Company and where we all have been impacted as we’ve gone through the disheartening process of letting colleagues and friends go in all parts of the Company. I’m at this stage optimistic thing we’ve completed the workforce reductions required in this downturn and I look forward to be able to shift focus throughout our organization from the negative sentiments of the past year towards a brighter future as we work through the remaining challenges of this downturn. In terms of R&D, we did reduce investment levels in 2015, but we were still able to protect our capabilities and ensure the progress of all our key projects. In the past year we made solid advances on several new technology fronts through a combination of organic and inorganic efforts and we look forward to update you further on this in our external communications in the coming year. And lastly in 2015, we significantly accelerated our corporate transformation program, stepping up both investment levels and the detailed engagement of our global organization. As part of this, we prepared a comprehensive and granular three-year transformation plan covering each of our 600 business units with specific deliverables and business impact goals set at all levels in our organization. In parallel with this, we’ve delivered noticeable cost savings and efficiency gains that can be seen in our 2015 financial results, together with a 23% reduction in our customer NPT rate, which is the largest annual improvement we’ve ever achieved. In summary, while 2015 has been extremely challenging year for the industry and for Schlumberger, we’ve clearly demonstrated our ability to navigate a complex landscape and capitalize on the opportunities the current business environment presents and we’re fully prepared to repeat these efforts and achievements in 2016. So while we all look forward to a recovery in the oil price, and the market conditions in our industry, it is evident that the longer the current market environment continues, the stronger we will emerge as a Company relative to our competitors when the upturn ultimately comes. Turning next to the market outlook, we still believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid growth in demand and by weakening supply as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments are starting to take effect. In North America, our shale oil production is declining more or less as we expected and was in December below the levels from one year ago. The apparent resilience in production outside of OPEC and North America is in many cases driven by producers opening the taps wide open to maximize cash flow, which also means that we will likely see higher decline rates after these short-term actions are exhausted. So while the global oil market is still being weighed down by fares to reduce growth in Chinese demand, the magnitude of additional uranium exports and the continued various trends in global oil inventories, we still expect a positive movement in oil prices during 2016 with specific timing being the function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates. This means that the market outlook for oil field services in the coming quarters will remain challenging at the pressure on activity and service pricing is set to continue. It also means that 2016 E&P investment levels will fall for a second successive year and that any significant recovery in our activity levels will be a 2017 event. Still at Schlumberger we remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings and to our global reach the strength of our technology offering and our corporate transformation program, we’re currently creating a considerable leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share, deliver superior earnings and margins and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer: Thank you. Thank you very much and congrats with another great -- relatively great year with free cash flow and solid performance.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Ole.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks.
Ole Slorer: When it comes to the macro outlook that you just painted, how should we think about the overall oilfield macro cycle? And relative to the internal momentum that you’re creating within Schlumberger with respect to the ongoing transformation process, I presume that a lot of the lowest hanging fruit has been picked in the transformation process. So if you could just bring us up to speed about how we should think about earnings projections over the next couple of quarters, several quarters with respect to those two kind of factors?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at our earnings trajectory in the coming quarters, it is obviously largely going to be driven by what continues to happen in the market around us in terms of the spend from our customers. But if you look at our ability to, I would say, counter the significant pricing pressure as well as the activity reductions, the transformation is indeed playing a significant role. I think it’s fair to say, like you say that a lot of the low hanging fruits we’ve already picked, but we’re now getting into the deeper part of the transformation where we’re making significant structural changes to how we go about doing our work and conducting our business. And this is basically laid out in the three-year plan that we worked on in 2015, which is going to take us from 2016 all the way out to 2019. And here we’ve broken down all the initiatives into specific actions and plans and targets for all the various business units we’ve around the world and I think with this, I would say, formalized way of driving performance I think we should look to put even more impact into our results in the coming three years and what you seen in the previous years.
Ole Slorer: Okay. I’ll take that. With respect to the free cash flow that you generated and clearly having a strong balance sheet, today is, I’d imagine, whereas an awful lot when it comes to the bargaining power that you’ve around the world. So how should we think about the opportunity around generating that or putting that to work as internal CapEx versus SPM, which I saw you just picked up a bit now again in the fourth quarter, and versus acquisitions?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, first of all, we continue to have a very strong focus on generating the cash. And I think 2015 was another solid year. It was not perfect. There were several things that I think we could have done better, but $5 billion of free cash flow in this environment is not bad. Now how we go about spending the cash, there is really no change to the philosophy that we’ve in any part of this cycle. The first thing we look to is to reinvest into the business and that is CapEx for the service and product segments that we have. In 2016, we’re going to keep CapEx flat with 2015 and that you may ask why? If you look at the base business, it is indeed coming down, but we’ve certain new activities that we’re looking to invest into in particular the land drilling market for the rig of the future and there is a few other strategic investments that we’re looking to make when it comes to our internal CapEx. In addition to this, we continue to invest in future revenue streams, both multiclient seismic where we’ve a significant program going on in Mexico. And at this stage of the cycle, there are also significant SPM opportunities and we’ve really stepped up our efforts in screening and evaluating these opportunities and we will capitalize on them when they meet our internal requirements. Beyond this, we review dividends annually. We are not increasing dividends this year. And then beyond that for the coming year, it’s going to be a balancing of the opportunities we’ve on M&A and the opportunities we have to buyback our stock. That is how we’re planning to spend the cash. Simon, you want to add something?
Simon Ayat: No, I think you’ve summarized it very well. I guess, 2016 is going to be marked by the big event of integrating Cameron and there is a lot of transaction as I described. We bought up $6 billion and we will be paying for the acquisition. We are also issuing shares, but we’ve the $10 billion in new program that w e will commence as soon as we exhaust the previous one.
Ole Slorer: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
James West: And congratulations also on -- just excellent execution really all year for you and your management team and all your employees and especially in the fourth quarter.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you very much.
James West: I wanted to follow-up a little bit on what you were talking about there in the second part of Ole’s question about really the SPM business. It seems -- I did notice the pickup in the fourth quarter, that’s probably project timing, but are you -- at this point are you chasing more projects? Are you getting more inbounds? And you talked a little bit about or you mentioned that your screening process had been updated or upgraded. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how you see this playing out over the next couple of quarters, couple of years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, we’re seeing significantly more SPM opportunities at this stage, of the cycle, given our ability to generate cash and given the status of our balance sheet. So we’ve -- we haven’t changed our screening process, but we’ve put more resources into it, so we can process more of these opportunities. And we’re prepared to step up our investments in SPM. As you noted, there was a step up in Q4 and it might not be at that level every quarter going forward, but I’d say that going into 2016 SPM is an area that we’re interested in investing further in. It provides us with solid long-term contract. It provides us with the ability to deploy our entire capability set and generate good returns and good cash for the Company. So it is a very interesting opportunity set for us that we’re actively pursuing.
James West: Okay. And then maybe another follow-up, the press release was littered with technology success stories and it seems like the technology adoption rate has picked up significantly during the downturn. I know you have given out numbers before on sales, percentage of sales on new technologies. Could you give us an update there on what you’re seeing on the adoption rates and if that percentages has improved?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, during this downturn the level of new technology sales which is basically technologies that we have commercialized in the past five years is at a significantly higher level than what we’ve seen in previous downturns. The new technology sales as a percentage of total revenues in 2015, is 24% which is markedly higher than what we saw in the previous downturn in 2008, 2009. This is partially down to the broad range of technologies that we have, and in fact that a number of them are focused on driving, I would say cost and efficiency for our customers. And these type of technology are as valid in terms of being bought and being operated during the downturn as they are in the upturn. So strong sales, and we continue to commercialize new technologies during 2015. So this obviously has had a very good impact on our financial performance in the past year, and I expect it to continue to do that in the year to come.
James West: Perfect. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Angie Sedita: I echo the sentiment, very solid quarter for the quarter and for the year given good business conditions, so well done. Maybe, Paal, we can go a little bit more granular on thoughts and obviously 2016 is a question mark, but thoughts into Q1 on a geo-market basis and walk us through where you’re thinking on a revenue and margin sign, if you will?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I’m not going to review the details by air Angie, what I think we’re going to do. If you’re looking for an indication of how we -- what we plan for and how we see Q1 shaping up, its going to be another very challenging quarter both from an activity and a pricing standpoint. The reasons new lows in oil prices is going to be reflected in lower REIT content and more activity disruptions we believe. This is going to be continued budget pressure throughout the first half from all customer groups where they now have to operate within cash flow. In addition we’re going to see the winter slowdown in the Northern hemisphere in Q1 which is going to be another activity headwind. So I would say that, rather than going into margins and revenues, if we focus in on EPS, I would say that the current Q1, EPS consensus is probably a best case scenario from what we can see today in terms of Q1 earnings.
Angie Sedita: Okay. That’s helpful. And then on Cameron, I know there is only so much you can say at this point. But if you have any further color, you can talk about on the opportunity set within Cameron as you move forward. But also talk us through or walk us through the integration of Cameron within Schlumberger, both operationally and how it will show up in the financial?
Paal Kibsgaard: Right. So, on the start up of the integration we are largely ready with our integration plans. We’ve had a sizable team made up of both Cameron and Schlumberger please working diligently on preparing these plans since we announced the transaction back in August. We reviewed all the plans in December and they have been approved, and we are basically ready for day one at this stage. Closing is now basically pending a few more countries in terms of antitrust approvals, and we do expect that we will close during the first quarter. In terms of synergies, the detailed work that we’ve done has really confirmed the numbers that we put up at the announcement. Lots of opportunities which initially are going to be cost focus, but this transaction is largely a revenue transaction and we are very excited about what we can do by joining the R&D forces of the two companies and creating the integrated drilling and production systems that we have laid out earlier. In terms of integrating Cameron as an organization, it would actually be a fairly simply task. Because Cameron as it is today will become the fourth product group of Schlumberger together with characterization, drilling and production. And Scott Rowe, the CEO of Cameron is going to join us and continue to head of Cameron in its present form. So the main thing we were focusing are in terms of integration initially. It’s going to be to coordinate the customer interface and to streamline the back office and also then morph or merge over time the R&D organization. So it is relatively a simple integration, because Cameron would slide in, in its present form into Schlumberger as the fourth group.
Angie Sedita: All right. Fair enough. Thanks. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hi. Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Kurt Hallead: Good morning. I just had a -- I had a couple of quick follow-up questions and some discussions within investors around the SPM dynamic. And in that context, Paal, just given the decline in oil prices year-to-date and the write down on the project in Colombia, there’s some questions out there just relating to potential incremental risk around existing SPM projects, and maybe you could put that into the context of maybe how you access risk on varying projects and maybe how you look at it from a portfolio approach?
Paal Kibsgaard: Right. So if you want to -- let’s start off with the write down we did in Colombia which is really an isolated event. This is a project that’s being going on between 10 and 15 years. We’re in the later years of the project. And it’s really the only project at this stage in our portfolio that has our compensation directly linked to the oil price. So with only a few years left and the oil price being at the very low level, this is what caused the impairment of the -- or the remaining balance we have. If you look at the rest of the portfolio and the new contract that we’ve entered into in recent years, these are all fee per barrel type of contract where obviously the project economics are linked to the oil price, but where our compensation is basically an isolated fee per barrel set up. So as with any of these projects they do carry a higher risk than what our base business does. But we are -- I would say very comfortable with being able to -- I would say identify and manage these risks. And with the screening process we had with the internal approval process that we have, I’m very comfortable with the step that we have in terms of the projects that we take on and that these all will generate very good returns for the company. And I would also say that the project in Colombia overall provided also very good returns and good cash flow throughout the life of the project.
Kurt Hallead: All right. That was great color. Then maybe if I could follow-up just on the margin front. If I understand correctly, you guys are trying to manage your business such that you can maintain a 20% margin maybe internationally here at the trough and maybe 5% in the North American market. I know a lot of that is being driven by your transformation process. And given the drop that we’ve had recently in oil price and the impact that we’ll have on E&P spend drop in 2016, how much harder do you think its going to be to maybe maintain those targets?
Paal Kibsgaard: But obviously fighting the margin pressure with both dramatic reductions in activity and significant pricing pressure, it’s tough. We have the added tool in our tool kit which is the transformation on top of our very, very solid management team that is excellent at executing, but it is tough to maintain margins at the levels that we currently see. I’m very pleased with how the North America team has managed and navigated in the past year, and 7.1% in Q4, I think is excellent. It’s going to be tough to continue to keep it at these levels. But with the energy and the focus our team on the ground in North America has, I’m optimistic that we will continue to significantly outperform the rest of the field there. Now if you look at the international margins, they are actually holding up recently well. We’re now six quarters into the downturn internationally, and we’re all at 253 basis points down which is basically half what we saw in 2009 in the last downturn. But it’s a very dynamic environment, and there’s always going to be quarterly variations driven by unplanned events. And if you look at LAM for an example, we had a big drop in Q3; yes we managed to close that back in Q4. Some of the actions that we put in place in the third quarter took full effect. Now in Q4 we did see a significant impact on our MEA margins and part of this is pricing and part of it is permanent activity reduction. But there is also a significant part which is temporary which is down to delays and stoppages. And if you look at the team we have on the ground, they have a long list of actions in place to address what they can in order to offset some of these margin headwinds. So I can't promise you that we’re going to get all the margins back in MEA, but I would say that the MEA team is clearly unhappy having being surpassed by the LAM team at the most profitable area. So I really look forward to the internal competition between these two.
Kurt Hallead: That’s great color. Thanks a lot, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Michael, your line is open. Check your mute button.
Michael LaMotte: Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Simon Ayat: Good morning.
Michael LaMotte: Paal, you mentioned a couple of times the three year transformation plan, and I imagine you’ll go into more detail in April. But can you just broad stroke the key categories that were identified as new areas of opportunity in the three year plan?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. There is no new areas that we have identified. What we’re doing with the three year plan is that, in the past couple of years there’s been a lot of work done in the central team formulate the detailed concepts and principals of how we want to change, how we operate our business. And these initiatives and these concepts are all now fully mature and they come together with a change management process that we have also put a lot of effort into designing. And what we’re doing with the three year plan is basically formalizing how each of these initiatives will now be translated into actions and results throughout the global organization. So in the past couple of years we have been pursuing the low hanging fruit. We are now going into the -- to the structural changes of our business that would also provide an additional step of savings and improvements in the years to come. But the focus is around asset and inventory management, its maintenance and repairs, transportation, distribution, supply chain, back office, quality assurance. It’s all the things that we’ve talked about in previous years, but its now being formalized and itemized down to the business unit levels. We have around 600 business units down to the country level and they all now have specific actions and targets on each of these line items to implement the changes that we have been preparing centrally for the past few years.
Michael LaMotte: Okay. And as we think about the financial impact, is order of magnitude similar to the low hanging fruit, it’s just the timing in terms of the flow through, the impact may take a little longer? How do we think about the implications on the financials?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I’d say the impact of the transformation going forward will at least be as big as it’s been in previous year and probably even higher in the years to come as we really start changing fundamental parts of how we conduct business. So this is not decreasing I would say, it’s stable to increasing in terms of impact going forward.
Michael LaMotte: Okay. So low hanging fruit doesn’t mean expect less going forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, absolutely not.
Michael LaMotte: Great. All right. Thanks. I’ll turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
James Wicklund: Good morning, guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Jim.
James Wicklund: Obviously the Cameron, Schlumberger OneSubsea JV has been a big success, it led to marriage. And now you’re doing an MoU with Golar, and looking on gas monetization solutions. Can you talk about how far the breadth -- how far this takes you, the Schlumberger Octopus grabs another segment of business? Can you talk a little bit about where this should go and why you did it?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well this is an MoU where we’ve had -- we had good discussions about the concepts of how we can combine some of our capabilities and efforts with the capabilities that Golar has and this is something that we will continue to work with them going forward. It is an interesting I would say combination. And I don’t have a lot of comments beyond this at this stage other than that it is the partnership that we’re looking to establish and to grow going forward.
James Wicklund: Okay. And just again, breadth. You’ve got now subsea, you’ve got equipment, you’re doing gas monetization. Kurt and James asked about the SPM business. You had said before in previous conference calls that you'd embrace a number of different business models. Is this the fruition of those kind of statements?
Paal Kibsgaard: I would say it is. But we don’t know this, it doesn’t change the fact that the main part of our business is, I would say oil free services and products and equipments. So we will continue to focus on leading each individual market that we continue, that we participate in for individual products and services. But with the integration capabilities and with the ability we have to pursue different type of business models, we are also looking to combine all of these things like you indicate Jim, to create more business opportunities for the company. So we are not pursuing only these. We have a huge focus on making sure that we standout and we continue to drive performance in the base business. But when you combine all of these things, there is a broad range of opportunities for us that we’re also pursuing.
James Wicklund: That’s very helpful. And my follow-up, if I could. Are we willing to take the chance and say that 2016 could be the bottom of the cycle or do you guys think today that 2017 will be worse than 2016?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think it’s too early to say Jim, but I’m -- I don’t currently think that 2017 is going to be worse. I think -- but with that said, I’m still not ready to say that we are troughing in 2016. I’ll be focusing in on executing basically quarter-by-quarter. I’m still optimistic, and I would hope that 2016 is the trough, but I’m not ready to rule on it yet.
James Wicklund: We'll keep our fingers crossed as well. Thanks sir, very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.
William Herbert: Thank you. Good morning. Back to SPM, I’m curious with regard to the projects that you’re seeing. Is there any change with regard to the kind of projects that you’re seeing now on a leading edge basis, more offshore versus onshore? And then moreover, with regard to as you evaluate these projects, recognizing that there’re are fee per barrel on the one hand, there must be an embedded oil price assumed as you’re looking at these projects in terms of a threshold oil price is required for the NSC to make capital if it is an NSC partner on these. So can you talk about the mix of projects, how it has changed and embedded oil prices associated with the capital allocation?
Paal Kibsgaard: Right. So, on the projects there is no shift in what the projects are. I mean, we’re looking at a certain set of projects. These are relatively small compared to what our customers would be interest in. And they are generally late life fields where we can come in and try to change the decline curve and add reserves and production to the field in late life. We are generally focused on LAM, and the only thing I would say is that the opportunity set has increased. There are more customers that are coming to us now that has these types of fields and they’re interested in doing these types of business models with us. So there’s not a dramatic shift in the type of assets that we’re looking at, but generally there’s more of them. And for the fields that we enter into a contract zone, obviously we will have to look at the total economics of the field for the lifetime of the contract which is generally I would say at least 15 years. So in that it’s obviously important that the total project is economical, and then the way we set up our contract is today generally on the fee per barrel where we are I would say insulated against variations in oil price. That being said, if it goes down, we don’t get hit at all. But again we are leavening the upside to our customers if oil prices are higher than what is in the assumption. So we have a very, I would say solid process on evaluating this. And like I said earlier in the call we’re actively pursuing these type of contracts where we can get the terms that we want contractually, and where we are satisfied that the reservoir holds the upside both in production and reserves.
William Herbert: Okay. And another one from me, sort of an extension of Jim's question in terms of testing the boundaries as to how broad, how plausibly broad your business model extends to; and that is; are you contemplating or evaluating anything on the clean technology front?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, not at this stage. I mean, we continue to -- I mean, if you look at minimizing the environmental impact with what we do at the company and our carbon footprint absolutely, we have several programs in place both in terms of, of how we conduct business as well as how we develop new technologies on this. But in terms of venturing outside of our current space which oil conservatives, there is no plans of doing that at this stage.
William Herbert: Okay. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Great, thank you. A question on kind of your Middle East Asia Pac business; obviously margins came down a good bit this quarter and a lot going on behind the scenes. I was wondering if you could help me kind of sort out some of the dynamics behind there. You talked about some activity disruptions in the Middle East. There's pricing going on. Asia Pac is probably also down -- probably also going to get hit pretty hard as well. Can you help us kind of understand some of those and how much of that’s kind of one time you think on the quarter?
Paal Kibsgaard: Now I tried hard -- I tried to answer that earlier David in the call and I would just say that, yes MEA margins dropped a fair bit in Q4, but there are variations in terms of all operations of activity that you will basically get some variations and in margins going forward. I gave LaMotte the example. Now there is significant pricing pressure. There is lower activity in parts of MEA, but are also some temporary aspects of what happened in the quarter where there were delays of big projects in terms of the startup where we had significant resources standing by and there were also some customers that stopped activity during the quarter because they were running out of annual budgets. And these budgets are going to be replenished now in January in which case we decided to carry the cost under resources. So I cannot promise you that we will regain all the loses in Q4 in terms of margins, but lots of actions in place to try to repeat what we’ve done in LAM over the course of 2015.
David Anderson: Those operational disruptions, do you think a lot of those are going to come back in the first quarter?
Paal Kibsgaard: Some of them will. And some of the -- for the ones that -- well we know which one they are and those are the ones to be carried the resources for. And for the ones that aren’t, you also know what they are in which case we have been cutting the resources.
David Anderson: And then on the pricing concessions, Paal you’ve been talking about and you talked about it last quarter as well. Is this on kind of new work that's being tendered or is this kind of pricing concessions on existing contracts?
Paal Kibsgaard: It’s a combination. When you tender for new work you will need to access what the growing rate in the market is, and in some cases you’ll get the opportunity to hang on to the existing contracts or even extend them provided there are some concessions given. So this is a combination.
David Anderson: Okay. And would the transformation -- does the transformation you think offset pricing over time largely?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well if you look at internationally in 2015, we have managed to offset internationally quite a lot of it. Can we do all of it? That’s probably going to be tough. But it is a significant counter to the pricing pressure that we’re seeing, yes.
David Anderson: Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
William Sanchez: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I was hoping before we ended the call that perhaps you could just speak generally about customer expectations internationally in terms of CapEx for ‘16. I mean, do you guys have a bottoms-up view yet at this point in terms of the size of the decline we could see as we try to think about calibrating overall top-line international revenue declines potentially for ‘16?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I mean, if you look at 2015, national spend was down about 20%. And then there is a range of surveys out now from third parties and the kind of average or consensus from these surveys is about, I would say more than a 10% reduction in international spend. So, if you go by these then yes it will be another challenging year. But also I think while we look at full year numbers, I think its also important to keep in mind the five or six quarters slide we have seen now in international E&P spend where we have had a significant drop in our revenue from Q4 of 2014 versus -- down to Q4 of this year and into Q1 of ’16. So while the year-over-year numbers for full year matters, I think it’s also important to look at the quarter levels we have now which is obviously significantly down. And actually if you do the Q1 revenue consensus for us, based on what your guys, analysts have done, four times that is already 17% down overall in revenue for us. So in that sense, the current level of activity and spend is already way down on a full year basis going forward.
William Sanchez: Okay. Thanks for that. I guess Simon, one for you. Given the pending Cameron acquisition here in the first quarter, is there any blackout period on Schlumberger being able to buyback stock as we approach that close?
Simon Ayat: No, none. Actually we are -- we will, after the blackout because of the earnings which is just in couple of days, we will be free to go back to the market. No, none, Bill.
William Sanchez: Okay. I’ll turn it back. Thanks for the time.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Daniel Boyd: Hi. Thanks, guys. I have a question for Simon, and more on the currency side continuing there. It looks like you’ve done a really good job so far this year of managing the currency risk. So, I would just like to understand how do you manage the currency risk in SPM projects, especially as you ramp those? And then if you could just help us, you quantified the revenue impact from currency this year. Can you help us with the international margin impact from how well you manage the currency?
Simon Ayat: Okay. Well, thanks. The last question. Let me just take overall the currency situation. As far as our international operation overall we have a natural hedge which, what it means is basically we match the revenue that we get the local currency. It is inline with our local cost and local currencies, it varies between jurisdictions. So in some areas we loose a bit on the currency but then gains in other places compensate for it. In 2015, you’ve seen the numbers; we have lost a lot of revenue because of currency. And almost 20% of the reduction of revenue between 2014 to 2015 was currency but actually did not impact the margin significantly. So it is all international. Yes, there is a bit of Canada, but the rest is outside NAM and we manage it as I said, it is natural hedge. We prevent ourselves from taking more local currency than we consume locally for local cost. As far as SPM is concerned, normally most of our SPM projects actually are dollar based, revenue wise, and those that have local currency they will basically reflect the same policy that I just mentioned to you, that we don’t take more than what we locally require for our cost and the third part that it is also bigger in SPM project. So naturally -- we are naturally hedged.
Daniel Boyd: Okay. So that -- are you saying that your margins didn't benefit from the currency? If your EBIT held up this year, you could have a few hundred basis point benefit in your margin. Is that accurate?
Simon Ayat: No, the currency -- big impact of the currency this last year was, one because of Venezuela, because we changed the currency rate. But otherwise did not impact us on the margins.
Daniel Boyd: Okay. Thank you.
Simon Farrant: Turn it over to Paal, Matt 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. So before we close this morning, I’d just like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed. First the business environment in the oil industry we can further into fourth quarter leaving traditional reductions in both activity and pricing levels and making 2015 the worse industry downturn since 1986. In spite of this we delivered strong full year performance compared to previous downturns generating $5 billion in free cash flow and returning $4.6 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In addition we spent $500 million on technology acquisitions that further broadened our portfolio and yet we increased our net debt by only $160 million. Second, 2016 will be another challenging year during which we will aim to continue to deliver superior financial results empowered with proceeding and capitalizing on the broad opportunity set the current market environment presents. We remain constructive in our view on the market outlook for the medium term, and continue to believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand is tightening driven by growth in demand, weakening supply as the massive cuts in the E&P investments take further effect and by the size of the annual supply replacement challenge. Lastly we look forward to closing our merger with Cameron International during the first quarter where the integration planning is largely complete for day one, and with anti-trust approvals all progressing on track. We are excited about what the combination of our two companies will bring. I look forward to joining forces with more than 20,000 Cameron employees. Overall we remain confident in our ability to continue to weather this downturn embedded in our surroundings through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and the extent of our corporate transformation program. That concludes the call. Thank you very much for attending.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Q3 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon Farrant: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the statement we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the projected statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share were $0.78. This represent decreases of $0.10 sequentially and $0.71 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion decreased 6% sequentially. Almost 40% of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing.  Despite the very challenging environment both in terms of pricing and activity, pre-tax operating margins only declined by 101 basis points sequentially. This was due to the continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. Sequential highlights by product group whereas follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 5% sequentially as decreases in exploration spending impacted both wireline and testing services internationally. Despite the revenue decline, pre-tax margin -- operating margins remained essentially flat at 26.3%. Drilling Group revenue of $3.3 billion, decreased 7%, primarily due to pricing pressures and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected drilling and measurements and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 94 basis points to 18.6%. Production Group revenue of $3 billion, decreased 5% sequentially, while margins declined 173 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by pricing and activity declines in Well Services. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate was 20% in the third quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 1 percentage point due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the Rest of the World as well as the mix of earnings amongst the international geo markets. Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the third quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first three quarters of 2015, we have generated $6.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $150 million during the third quarter and $600 million during the first nine month of the year.  Net debt improved $400 million during the quarter to $5.2 billion. During the quarter, we spend $545 million to repurchase 6.9 million shares at an average price of $78.76. Subsequent to the announcement of our transaction with Cameron in August, we have been repurchasing the maximum number of shares allowable under the SEC’s regulations. We filed our S4 registration statement relating to the acquisition two weeks ago today. It’s worth highlighting that once the SEC declares our registration statement effective and the proxy statement is mailed. We will be prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our stock until the Cameron shareholder vote. We spent $590 million on Capex during the third quarter. Full-year 2015 Capex excluding multi-client and SPM investments is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you Simon and good morning everyone. Schlumberger third quarter revenues fell 6% sequentially, driven by continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations. North America revenues fell 4% sequentially, as we maintain focus on balancing margins and market share, while international revenue was 7% lower as customer budget cuts and service pricing erosion impacted results. Still in the midst of what may well turn out to be the most severe downturn in several decades, our operating margins were maintained at levels much higher than in previous downturns.  In North America, pre-tax operating margins were held at 8.9% in spite of an additional drop in activity and pricing both offshore and on land. While international margins dropped to 23.7% as customer budget cuts, activity cancellations and lower service pricing took further effect. In the first nine months of 2015, year-over-year revenue has dropped 34% in North America and 18% internationally, yet we have delivered nine month decremental operating margins of 34% in North America and 23% internationally, which represents a strong performance improvement over the 2009 downturn. We have delivered these results by proactively and decisively managing our cost and resource base, carefully navigating the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share and at the same time, accelerating our internal transformation program. We also generated more than $1.7 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter, which represents a conversion rate of 170% of the quarter’s earnings. Our ability to generate significant free cash flow even in this part of the cycle is a major competitive edge which we actively use to pursue new business opportunities as well as targeted M&A activity. In terms of M&A, our main focus in recent months has been the proposed acquisition of Cameron announced on August 26, which will open up a significant growth opportunity for us, as we look to establish the industry’s first complete drilling and production systems, spanning both the surface and the subsurface. In addition, we also completed the acquisition of Houston-based T&T Engineering, which specializes in design of land rig systems as well as Utah-based Novatek, which is a leader in the field of synthetic diamond innovation. We also signed a letter of intent for a joint venture with a part of the Bauer Group from Germany in further revolution of our land-rig-of-the-future strategy. And finally, we entered into an agreement with IBM to jointly provide integrated production optimization services combining our production software platform with IBM’s enterprise asset management services in an end-to-end offering. Looking at our results on a geographical basis, North American revenue decreased 4% sequentially, a figure considerably less than the 27% sequential decrease seen in the second quarter and better than the 7% drop in the average horizontal rig count. On land, the revenue growth was driven by lower hydraulic fracturing activity and additional pricing pressure for both products and services. In the Gulf of Mexico, revenue declined on lower multiclient seismic sales, exploration rigs transferring to drilling and completion activities, as well as pricing concessions which were partially offset by higher new technology sales. In Western Canada, rig count almost doubled sequentially, following the early spring break up, but was still down by roughly 52% year-over-year. In spite of these headwinds, operating margins in North America decreased by only 136 basis points sequentially to 8.9% and this strong performance is the direct results of our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing effects of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management. As service pricing in US land fell further in the third quarter, we continued our approach of concentrating activity in core areas and for key customers while proceeding to start equipment rather than operating at a loss. In the rare event, we select to pursue work at what we consider non-commercial prices. We view this as an investment decision and apply the same justification and approval process used for any other reinvestment we do in our business. This has let us to move equipment and crews between basins as we look to balance market share with margins and as we pursue new technology opportunities. We believe that this approach has enabled us to protect our profitability in North America land and has also helped us maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term ability to service our customers in this market. In the international markets, revenue declined 7% sequentially due to further customer budget cuts, rapidly changing activity driven by the disruptions, delays and cancellations, as well as by further pricing concessions. Third quarter international operating margins of 23.7% was down 72 basis points sequentially and 83% basis points year-over-year. Our nine month decremental margins were still held to 23% which represents a marked improvement over the 61% from the corresponding period in the 2009 downturn which is a testament to both the strength of our international business and how well our organization is executing. Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenues declined by 8% sequentially while pretax operating margins decreased 171 basis points to 27%. Activity in the Middle East remained robust during the quarter, particularly in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, but pricing concessions, changes to the activity mix, as well as project delays had a negative impact on revenue and profitability. Year-over-year area revenue decreased 20% while margins dropped by 61 basis points. Our lump sum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia continued to progress well and with steady improvements in drilling efficiency, well deliveries are now ahead of planned levels.  In the United Arab Emirates, robust drilling production and seismic activity was boosted by further rig additions and we also recorded strong sales of Petrel and ECLIPSE software. Drilling activity was also stronger in Kuwait as rig count increased, however, this was partly offset by operational delays and an activity shutdown in the neutral zone.  In Iraq, we mobilized two rigs for the Zubair lump sum turnkey project with the first well already completed, while revenue from the other operations in the country remained flat with the second quarter.  In Southeast Asia, activity was lower throughout the region driven by a further drop in Offshore Australia as project ended, lower rig count in Malaysia, reduced deep-water exploration and development work in the South China Sea and continuing NOC budget cuts on land in China.  In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially, while pretax operating margins fell 159 basis points to 20.7%. In Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, activity was further hit by a combination of delays and budget reductions, while Colombia was weaker due to increased pricing pressure. These effects were however, partially offset by steady activity in Venezuela and Ecuador.  Year-over-year area revenue decreased 30% and operating margins decreased by 120 basis points. In Mexico, revenue dropped again in the third quarter and now stands at an eight-year low as the significant budget cuts further impacted activity and profitability. At the same time, we began multiclient seismic operations in the Gulf of Campeche and awards for the second and third license rounds of the Energy Reform Act remain on schedule.  Offshore activity continued to decline in Brazil as budget reductions impacted both equipment rentals and field operations. And in addition to this, revenue was also hit by the weakening of the reais. In Venezuela, activity was steady for both the PDVSA and for the heavy-oil joint ventures in the Faja, while in Ecuador, SPM activity was flat as the Shushufindi project continued to perform in line with expectations.  In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue fell 6% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins increased 92 basis points to 22.2%. Year-over-year revenue decreased 31% and margins dropped by 125 basis points. Within the area, the bright spot in the third quarter was Russia and Central Asia, where revenue continued to increase with peak summer drilling activity in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This increase was however partially offset by a weaker ruble.  In the North Sea, increased drilling in the UK sector was insufficient to counter lower activity in the remote areas and was further offset by reduced activity in Norway from project delays and cancellations as well as currency weakness.  In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity increased in Gabon in the third quarter, but was considerably lower in the rest of the region as operations were halted in Chad. Exploration work dropped to a new low in Angola and also projects were cancelled in Nigeria. In Algeria and Tunisia, activity was also down in the third quarter, while in Libya, our operations continues to be limited to one offshore rig.  Turning next to the overall market outlook, we see two clear trend emerging. First, as we enter the last quarter of the year, the global oil market is still weighed down by fears of reduced growth in China, and the timing and magnitude of additional Iranian exports. However, the fundamental balance of supply and demand continues to tighten driven by both solid global GDP growth and by weakening supply as dramatic cuts in E&P investments start to take full effect. We expect this trend to continue and as the oil markets further recognizes the magnitude of the industry’s annual production replacement challenge, this will gradually translate into improvements in oil prices going forward.  Second, in spite of the expected improvements in oil prices, the market outlook for oilfield services looks challenging for the coming quarters, as we expect additional reductions in activity and further pressure on service pricing. This is driven by the financial pressure on many of our customers where a year of very low oil prices is now exhausting available cash flow and corresponding capital spending and also leading them to take a very conservative view on 2016 E&P budgets. In addition to this, the winter season will have the normal negative impact on activity, which in the fourth quarter, is unlikely to be offset by the usual year-end sales of software products and multi-client licenses. Based on this industry outlook, we expect E&P investments to fall for a second successive year in 2016, which is the first time since the 1986 downturn, when the spare capacity cushion was more than 10 million barrels per day. In spite of the need for the industry to increase investment levels to mitigate the pending impact on global supply, we instead see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between the expected improvement in oil prices and the subsequent increase in E&P investments and oilfield services activity. This timing gap or increased response time is a direct consequence of the dramatic cost in E&P investments, which have clearly damaged the oil industry’s financial strength and investment appetite as well as the operating capacity and capability. So while our macro view has not changed in terms of a tightening supply and demand balance and an expected improvement in oil prices, we have to factor in that the likely recovery in our activity levels now seems to be a 2017 event. We communicated in our previous earnings call that we were prepared to live with our existing cost base going forward, provided we were close to the bottom of the market and that the activity recovery was only a couple of quarters out. As a result, we carried our cost base forward into Q3, which had some negative impact on our operating margins and we did not report any exceptional restructuring charges in the quarter. The likely timing gap between the oil price recovery and the subsequent increase in oilfield services activity in combination with a more conservative spending outlook from our customers is causing us to now take further action. We have therefore decided to proceed with a further round of capacity and overhead reductions, which will result in a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. This charge will cover severance cost for additional headcount reductions, reflecting both our updated activity outlook for 2016 and a further streamlining of our support structure. In addition and as part of our internal transformation program, we are now ready to initiate a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will also result in a charge in the fourth quarter. We will seize opportunities to streamline our engineering, manufacturing and sustaining infrastructure by consolidating sites into clusters both in central locations and in the field, while at the same time, further modernize our processes by introducing state of the art manufacturing automation in line with the best companies in other high tech industries. These changes to our manufacturing and distribution network are closely coordinated with the integrated plans for Cameron, which are already well advanced and which will be quickly implemented once the transaction has closed. So far in this downturn, we have proactively and decisively managed our cost and resource base, carefully navigated the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share, at the same time, as we have actively accelerated our internal transformation program. With the above actions, we are continuing this prudent approach with the aim of protecting and extending our solid financial performance into 2016, which is shaping up to be another challenging year for the oilfield services industry. We further believe that our ability to respond to higher E&P investments and oilfield activity in 2017 will be improved by protecting our financial strength in 2016, rather than carrying at accepted costs and inefficiencies as we await the recovery of the oilfield services market. Overall, we remain very confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings and through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and our transformation program, we are creating a significant financial leverage that will enable us to increase market share, deliver superior earnings and margins and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ole Slorer at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer: Well, thank you very much. And, Paal, I wonder whether we could start with the macro and maybe before that, Simon congrats with another great set of free cash flow numbers.
Simon Ayat: Thanks, Ole.
Ole Slorer: But let us start with the macro for now. Where do you think that the weakening supply has played our differently or similarly to what you would have thought 3, 6 or 12 months ago in light of recent CapEx cuts?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think it’s playing out more or less as we have expected globally. I think what you see in OPEC, there is really no change to overall production capacity. There is a continuous shift from spare capacity into marketed supply. In North America, the production is coming down more or less as expected as well and internationally, we are starting to see signs of a weakening supply as well. I think in all these three main sources of supply, while production is starting to come down, I think there are also significant efforts to maximize production within each of these basis while in some cases taking more short-term actions to maximize production which might actually have a negative on long-term recovery. I think there is only a limited period that this can be done and while the various players exhaust these type of opportunities, if investments aren’t increased, I think you will see a further acceleration of the drop in production.
Ole Slorer: And the timing of that acceleration, do you have a view on that?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, it’s still a bit difficult to say, but I think there are clear signs now in all – at least in North America and non-NAM and OPEC that production is weakening and we expect that to continue and potentially accelerate in the event the investments aren’t increasing.
Ole Slorer: Okay, thanks for that. Just sort of based on what you highlight here, with respect to CapEx trends in respect of oil prices, just having a shot at your fourth quarter and first quarter next year, with a 10% EPS reduction into the fourth quarter and then another 5% into the first quarter, would that be a reasonable trajectory?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, let me say this. Q4 looks challenging and visibility had actually dropped in the past month or two now. So, formal [ph] activity is down, but in Q4 we will see the start of the wind to slow down in the northern hemisphere. We also see further budget cuts in several of the key offshore markets such as Sub-Sahara Africa, Brazil and the Far East. We also expect rig activity in North America land to be down in Q4 due to the financial stress on many of our customers there and we expect very limited yearend sales of product, software and multiclient. So EPS will drop, but due to the lack of the visibility we have now, Ole, I am not really ready to commit to a number, but I will also say that Q1 in spite of Q4 not having the seasonal uptick in yearend sales, we also see Q1 being below Q4.
Ole Slorer: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks a lot.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks, Ole.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to the line of James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: Hey, good morning Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning. 
James West: Paal, so we’ve now pushed out the recovery to ’17, but I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on how you see ‘16 playing out. Clearly you just mentioned 1Q is going to be below 4Q, does that mark the bottom in earnings and we are kind of going sideways from those next year or is there a potential for a second half modest upturn?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we hope that Q1 will represent the bottom and there would be a gradually, but slow recovery during the year or even sideways. I think it is still too early to say, James. I think we have, even for Q4 now there is significant uncertainties in several of the markets on what’s going to happen. Beyond that we clearly see Q1 being below Q4, but visibility, Q1 is still very low. So I would hope that what you kind of depict will be the case, but I think it’s too early to say. But I would say also that there is a limit to how long these reductions in investment and activity can continue. And I think as the oil price now likely will start to move upwards, hopefully investments will turnaround, but anything meaningful will be late ‘16 and into 117 as we see it as per today.
James West: Okay, got it. And then, Paal, you specifically called out M&A in the press release last night and you had a number of smaller deals in addition to Cameron this quarter, or last quarter excuse me. Are you preparing the market for something additional of size or is this just highlighting the fact that you guys are generating tons of cash, you got a huge flexibility?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah, it’s still out there, we’re not preparing the market for anything other than refocus significantly our entire organization on generating free cash. Margins are a key ingredients to generate cash. So both of those are key focus areas for us in terms of protecting and extending our strong financial performance. And obviously, in this type of market, companies that can generate significant free cash has a broad range of opportunities and I think we’ve shown so far in the downturn that we will be opportunistic. What opportunities are there and which one we will convert, we will revert back to you when we have converted them. But as of now, we will continue to be opportunistic but there is no preparation or any methods beyond that.
James West: Okay, got it. Thanks Paal.
Operator: We’ll go next to the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angie Sedita: And again impressive free cash flow and decrementals there versus the peer group. So, Paal in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about the outlook for 2016 as far as E&P spending and I know it’s obviously early to have much granularity. So, where we have less visibility is internationally and maybe you can just give us some color there on what you’re hearing with your conversations, with your customers around the world as far as the spending outlook for 2016 both land and offshore?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah, we don’t have a lot of granularity Angie; it’s still just kind of broad-based statements. Most of our customers haven’t completed or just barely started our budgeting process for 2016. But the general feedback is very consistent. And that is, they expect, the vast of them that spend will be lower. So I can’t give you granularity of geography or land and offshore. I would say though that the part of that rule that is still very, very resilient is obviously the GCC countries in the Middle East. So I’m not expecting anything significant there in terms of lower investments. But broad-based pretty much everywhere else. There are significant challenges and we expect 2016 budgets to be below 2015.
Angie Sedita: Okay, okay, that’s helpful. And if you -- you think about the U.S. and obviously it’s a smaller market for you. But as you think about the U.S. and you’ve said on a number of occasions that the pricing is unsustainably low. And as we all know that many of these smaller companies are free cash flow negative. I mean how do you think this plays out in 2016 going into 2017, could even a modest increase in activity in oil prices led to even modest improvements in pricing or how do you think this plays out, any thoughts?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. I’m not very optimistic on any turnaround in service and product pricing for oilfield services in North America land. I think, yes, many of the small companies or most of the small companies are free cash flow negative. They are under significant financial stress and maybe some of them will go bankrupt in the coming quarters or in the coming year. But there is still massive overcapacity and even these small companies that go bankrupt will likely be picked up other investors and their assets will be returned back into the market. So, I think the overcapacity is going to be with industry for quite a considerable amount of time. So I don’t expect any real improvement in service and product pricing in the coming year in North America land.
Angie Sedita: All right, great. Thanks I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
Bill Herbert: Wondering if we can talk about a little bit about the flexibility of the U.S. upstream value chain here as we’re getting deeper into this downturn. And I mean the supposition has been and perhaps continues to be the -- once the recovery narrative is embraced by the industry that the industry can respond quickly and assertively to an increase in spending and activity. Do we still think that’s the case given the duress of the industry and the fact that many are not only cutting into fat and muscle but now bone.
Paal Kibsgaard: So I think the industry is -- so I think the market is probably overestimating how quickly the industry can respond whether it’s in North America or internationally. I think the fact that now four quarters into very low oil prices, the financial strength of many of our customers has significantly weakened and their appetite to invest is also a bit down. Any I think – any improvement in oil prices, I think will be to initially – is going to go towards the strength in the balance sheet and then the oil companies will likely assess how sustainable are these increases in oil prices before they start investing.  So there is a delay, I believe, between an improvement in oil prices and the decision to increase budgets. And there is going to be a further delay between increasing budgets and realizing that into higher oil field activity. And then there is going to be a delay in between higher oil activity and higher production. So I think there – the market is underestimating how long this period is going to take and just the fact that the industry is again looking to reduce investments when we have this significant pending supply impact coming. This shows that I think we are – we even have increasing chance of a potential spike in oil prices if investments aren’t increased in time. 
Bill Herbert : Okay. And then secondly, so given the duress that you’re processing here for the next several quarters, notwithstanding the fact your decrementals in Q3 were still very laudable, they trended higher. And I’m just curious as to whether we see accelerating decrementals over the next quarters or do they stabilize or what’s your view with regards to the roadmap on that front?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, in terms of our decrementals, we are working flat out to continue to manage them at our own levels that you’ve seen so far this year. So we are not giving up on that, we have continuous efforts both in reducing cost and capacity as well as creating more leverage to offset pricing from our transformation. So we are going to continue to work very hard at delivering continuously very strong decrementals. We see that that’s very important to sort of maintain our financial strength and also to help us generate the strong free cash flow that you’ve seen so far this year. 
Bill Herbert: Okay, thank you. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to the line of Jim Crandell at Cowen.
Jim Crandell: Good morning. Paal, the – based on maybe a more limited sample size, we seem to see a number of companies quarrelling for 20% to 30% reductions in their CapEx for 2016. Is that a range that you think is reasonable at this point? 
Paal Kibsgaard: I think, full year 2016 – for full year 2016, that sounds like a high number. At this stage, I don’t think it’s going to be as much as that, no. 
Jim Crandell: And based on your conversations with the – with managements of some of the NOCs, would you think that the NOCs in Latin America, West Africa and Asia would be still one of the weakest points in the market. I noticed that Angola is cutting spending by 50% next year, and do you think that’s going to be indicative of some of the NOCs in those regions?
Simon Ayat: Well, that number again I think is high, but I think the fact that this customer group has cut significantly this year and would likely go down potentially further next year, I think is a reasonable assumption. But again, my commentary on 2016 is based on very high level discussions and I don’t have details of what budgets and what numbers are going to be. Other than that, it seems to be consensus that overall spend will be down. I think your 20% to 30% is very high. It’s likely to be less than that, but still I expect it to be down. 
Jim Crandell: And how would you – in a declining market, how do you think that that affects the market share of integrated services for Schlumberger?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don’t think it has a direct impact on anything in terms of up or down. There continues to be a broad range of integration type of opportunities. We are pursuing order, but it is all the way from bundle services from a few of our product lines all the way up to full turnkey lump sum contracts as well as SPM opportunities. So nothing dramatic in terms of shift of integration opportunities. It continues to be a key part of what they offer and there is a generally growing appetite from all customer groups to engage in those type of contracts. 
Jim Crandell: Good. Okay, thank you. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you. 
Operator: We’ll go next to the line of Bill Sanchez at Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
Bill Sanchez: Thanks. Good morning, Paal. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning. 
Bill Sanchez: Paal, I want to try to understand a bit more from you the magnitude of the pricing declines internationally that you’re seeing and what the duration from here is going to be and I guess specifically kind of where are we now or where are you I should say in working through all of your contract renegotiations with your customers?
Paal Kibsgaard: I can’t give you a number, Bill, on this, other than, I think, it’s clear that the pricing impact internationally all the way, it is significant to our operations, it is still significantly lower than what we’ve seen in North America and North America land. I would say that round one of the pricing discussion is complete. There might be more coming in the coming quarters and I think as long as oil prices are down, and the outlook is still relatively somber, then there is a constant pressure on pricing internationally as well as in North America land. So, we continue to work through that. We bid competitively on the tenders that are out there, customers that are looking to renegotiate, we engage in those discussions and obviously, we’re trying to minimize and protect how we -- what we concede in these type of discussions, but that’s a call we make in this situation around what market share we are looking at, what kind of terms and conditions we can get, so some of the things and how we look at the overall business that we run. This is a normal part of business. When there is overcapacity, there is pressure on pricing, and that’s part of what we do for a living to manage that.
Bill Sanchez: Do past renegotiations that you’ve, for the like of, kind of settled with your customers, do those get reopened here as we go into 2016 or these are just incremental discussions that you’re still having on contracts that really haven’t been negotiated at this point or renegotiated at this point?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think it’s a mix of all of it that I think you see it in North America land and you see at international. Overcapacity, there is a continuous pricing discussion until we hit the bottom of the market and then it stabilizes and then we look upwards from there. So there is a mix of renegotiations of contracts already discussed and some of them, which have not been changed already. So there is a combination of all of that.
Bill Sanchez: Okay. Simon, a follow-up for you or a question for you, can you give us an idea of when the share repurchase blackout period will begin for you?
Simon Ayat: Okay. So as I mentioned in my remarks, once we supplied the S4 and it is accepted, there will be a blackout period. I am expecting it to be about four to five weeks and could start maybe early November.
Bill Sanchez: Okay. And I guess we would expect repurchases to take place up until that point?
Simon Ayat: Yeah. Now, I like to take this opportunity just to remind you that first, we are issuing a large number of shares and the number of shares that will be issued, it’s going to take place by our US based subsidiary. You’re going to see a large movement in the capital structure of Schlumberger between our US subsidiary and the parent company. In other words, the US subsidiary will be the one acquiring Cameron and as a result, it’s going to acquire the shares from the parent company.  So you’re going to see eventually when we close the transaction of Cameron, a large swing in the capital structure between the US based subsidiary, our parent company because of the structure of the acquisition and this would require the US subsidiary as I said to acquire shares from the parent company. So, there will be a large movement of cash from the US based subsidiary into the parent company. But when times will come, we’ll explain it to you in more details and how it’s going to work out.
Bill Sanchez: Great. I appreciate the time. I’ll turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to the line of David Anderson of Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Thanks. Paul, I was hoping you could expand a bit more on what you see on the exploration front. In the commentary, you noted Gulf of Mexico continue to transition. Now, West Africa is starting to roll those exploration programs. And what’s the mindset of your customers at this point of where that fits in the portfolio, you talked about -- the first and foremost about the balance sheet is obviously about dividend, but is it just about getting development costs down first and this exploration is kind of pushed out, well, how does that kind of fit in terms of your vision for the next couple of years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. I think what you’re saying is correct. The focus on driving cost down is on development and exploration is basically eliminated. That’s how I think many customers look at it. There are significant cuts in exploration activity and they continue both for seismic and for drilling. The Q3 exploration rig count was down about 25% year-over-year and the seismic spend was also down in excess of 30% and that’s following a pretty low year in 2014 as well. So it is very challenging for exploration activity for us, but again the impact of this is still fully absorbed in our results which are still reasonably good. So, yes, in summary, our customers are more or less cutting completely exploration and focusing a lot more in driving further cost out of the development.
David Anderson: And on that side, on the development, as you integrate OneSubsea into Schlumberger, this will be a pretty big opportunity to pull on the rest of Schlumberger to help bring down development cost. If I think about you leaning on your reservoir expertise and well design capabilities, how receptive have customers been so far to Schlumberger taking a greater role in that offshore development. It would seem to be as a pretty big mindset change for your customers. I mean, is that happening? Do you feel confident of that? Do you think projects can actually move ahead in ’16 because of that or is that a little too optimistic in terms of the timing? 
Paal Kibsgaard: It might be slightly optimistic on the timing, but I think – so first of all, many of the things that you mention in terms of bringing together these capabilities of Schlumberger and OneSubsea is already happening, but obviously we can accelerate and have an even further impact on this as we close the transaction and take full management of OneSubsea, but I am very pleased with the progress that OneSubsea has made and the close working relationship we’ve had OneSubsea from the Schlumberger side. But I think over time and maybe not already in 2016, there is significant cost reduction potential in the – for the deepwater, I think both, when it comes to the well cost as well as for the overall infrastructure. I think we can simplify, we can standardize, we can engineer costs out of the system and what that will allow, if you can, for instance, reduce the well cost by, say, 30%, you can potentially drill four wells for the price of three, which again will help you increase production and recovery from the deepwater fields which obviously will help lower cost of barrel and then improve the economics. So I think we are in very, very early innings in terms of driving down costs for deepwater, both production and then the drilling part of it. And I think what we are doing now with the Cameron acquisition is going to address both those dimensions.
David Anderson: Great. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks.
Operator: We will go next to the line of Scott Gruber at Citi.
Scott Gruber: Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning. 
Scott Gruber: Turning back to international decrementals, you guys continue to post very impressive figures during this down cycle, but at what rate of upstream spending decline abroad with this 25%, 30% decrementals be at risk of rising? I know there is not a lot of clarity on exactly how spending will turn out next year, but spending is down 15%, would you start to become concerned or would it take a steeper drop to really threaten those decrementals?
Simon Ayat: You are talking about 2016 spending.
Scott Gruber: Correct.
Simon Ayat: Well, we have delivered I think very strong financial performance in the international market now for a number of years. In 2014, we generated 69% incrementals on quite limited revenue growth and so far 23% decrementals on 18% drop in revenue this year. So our performance so far this year is not a fluke, we have been very good at managing our international business. So I am expecting that even with still further headwinds in terms of top line in 2016, we should be able to continue to hold the decrementals at a very respectable level, whether they are going to be at 23% or slightly higher, it will be difficult to say. But in terms of offsetting activity reductions through cost cutting, I think we have proven that we can do that. And beyond that it is how much leverage we can generate from the transformation to offset pricing. So both of those are – we are very active on trying to delivery both of those type of results. And we are going to go very hard at it for 2016 to continue to delivery strong decrementals internationally.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then you already touched on the need for customers to repair their balance sheets which will likely contribute to the delay in activity recovery. Is there also an oil price threshold that you have in mind that need to be achieved before your customers start to increase CapEx? I mean, do we need to see $65 Brent or $70 Brent. At what level do you think customers are comfortable expanding their budgets even if there is some delay?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don’t have a specific oil price number in mind. I think it’s going to be much more functional how sustainable our customers see the increases in oil prices to be. I think it’s more about having a stable basis for increasing investments before they go ahead and do it right. I still that they are -- that there is going to be conservatism based on the very tough four quarters that the industry has gone through at this stage. And that’s why again we are basically saying that there is going to be a lag between higher oil prices and investments, and even a tag between our investments and realizable oil selectivity.
Operator: Anything further Mr. Gruber?
Scott Gruber: Well nope, that’s it, got it. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.
Michael LaMotte: If I could follow-up just on transformation quickly and ask you to expand upon two areas in particular. First you’re comments on the reorganization of the manufacturing operations and how long that is expected to take and if you could quantify the gross margin benefit perhaps of that effort. And then secondly, in the press release, this is the first time we’ve seen the references to the multiskilling. So if you could give us an update in terms of where we are in the progress of that effort as well?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah. On the transformation around the global manufacturing and distribution, the charge we’re taking is for consolidating facilities, moving much more towards campuses and clusters and also the introduction of some new automation manufacturing type of technology. Similarly, we’re also looking to consolidate how we do global distribution going more from a global and local set up to a much more regional setup in terms of how we manage that. So the process of getting it done, we are -- we have already embarked on. And there are some charges associated with it that we will take in the fourth quarter and we will continue implementing that program in 2016 and 2017. So, I’m not going to be able to give you a specific impact on margins and what this is going to generate for us, although that we’re -- we are very excited about doing this. It’s going to modernize a core part of the company and its going to make us even more competitive in the international market. Now in terms of multiskilling, this is part of how we’re continuing to drive people productivity. There is many other aspects of what we do there, we have remote operations as another key part of this as well, where we can centralize much more of our expertise and have them oversee more jobs centrally rather than being at the well side as well. So, all of these elements are key part of the transformation program and we are still not at the halfway point of rolling this out globally and for it to have the full impact on our operations on our results. So there is still a lot of runway left in both the multiskilling, the remote operations and what we’re going to do on manufacturing and distribution as well as all the other parts of the transformation. So we’re excited about it and there is a strong pull from the entire organization on this and we continue to work hard on implementing it.
Michael LaMotte: Great, thank you. And if I could ask a follow-up quickly to Simon. Would you be perhaps, I noticed debt came down; total debt came down in the third quarter from the second quarter. During the blackout would you be using free cash flow to further pay down debt or can we just assume that that cash builds on the balance sheet in that interim?
Simon Ayat: So, good question Michael. Some of the -- most of our debt actually is a fixed debt. So we do have certain percentage which is more reflective of commercial paper, et cetera, this will go down. But as I said earlier and I like to repeat this that you’re going to see a large movement in our capital structure. And perhaps eventually, we will have a little bit more debt associated with the transaction coming from our North America or our U.S.-based subsidiary. And this to acquire the shares from the parent company. So you’re going to see a different type of movement and eventually there will be larger debt that we will have in the U.S. subsidiary in order to acquire the shares.
Michael LaMotte: Post close?
Simon Ayat: In the meantime, during the blackout period, as you highlighted it would reflect into a reduction in the debt, which is the current debt that is reflected in the simple [ph] program that we issue on daily basis.
Michael LaMotte: Great, thanks Simon. 
Operator: We’ll go next to the line Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Jud Bailey: Thanks, good morning. Paal, I ask you about a couple of different markets outside of North America, it seems like Latin America continues to trend some of the more – one of the more difficult international markets. Could you maybe comment on Mexico and also, particularly on Brazil given all the issues going on the Petrobras and some of the contract renegotiations and how you’re thinking about that market and how it may impact you in 2016? 
Paal Kibsgaard: Yeah, both markets, as you point out, both Mexico and Brazil have been very challenging this year. Mexico, even more than Brazil, I would say. So there has been significant budget reductions and they have continued throughout the year. Like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our Q3 revenues now stands at an eight-year low, which is quite remarkable for a sizable market as Mexico is for us.  So in terms of next year, it’s still very early for both of these countries, Mexico and Brazil, but I think it’s going to be challenging as we enter into 2016. Though, I don’t have a lot of details of it yet, but no positive signs either from Pemex or from Petrobras at this stage. 
Jud Bailey: Okay. Thank you. And I’ll – my follow-up is on – just to circle back on international pricing, understanding you’re kind of done with Round 1, but as you kind of look at the market today, is pricing getting – is it starting to decline worse than it did earlier in the year or is there any sign of it stabilizing or do you get the sense that the pricing is slipping even more? And are there any particular markets internationally, where you are seeing more pricing pressure than others? 
Paal Kibsgaard: No, it is not, I’d say slipping further, it’s just – there is a continuing pricing pressure in this part of a cycle. It’s quite normal. There is nothing special about it. And as long as the outlook is negative, then there will be continued pricing pressure. Every bit that is out, there is even increased competition to get it and that creates the downward pricing pressure. So nothing exceptional. I don’t see it accelerating. Other than that is not going way, and we will just continue to manage it and navigate it the way we have been doing so far in the downturn. 
Jud Bailey: Great, thank you. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And the last question will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, Kurt. 
Kurt Hallead: So just I’m curious Paal, when you think about the – going back to the M&A dynamic, the Eurasia deal kind of fell through, that’s – is that something that still could be – come back on the table at some point going forward? And when you think more broadly about M&A, is the Schlumberger interest right now more in some geographic opportunities or is it in some product specific areas generally speaking?
Paal Kibsgaard: Just to say the Eurasia deal first of all, obviously we were disappointed that we couldn’t get it closed within the several extensions of the timeline that we agreed with Eurasia. But that deal is now closed for us. So I don’t really have any more comments on that.  In terms of other M&A, we continue to be opportunistic. I can’t go into details of what that will entail or what we may or may not do. Other than that, we have a broad view of the entire market and what opportunities are there, what they are interested in. And we continue to evaluate companies on a monthly basis and if there is a willing seller and a good price, then we might be able to do something more, but it’s still too early to say. So I can’t promise anything or I can’t make any further comments on what may happen. Other than that, we continue to be active in assessing the market and look for opportunities to further extend and strengthen our portfolio and we keep generating the cash to allow us to do that. 
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That’s great. I’ll keep it there, and we’re seeing a little bit. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Very good.
Paal Kibsgaard: All right, so before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed. First, while the business environment clearly got worsened in third quarter, our focus on cost management and transformation has enabled us to deliver strong financial performance and generate significant liquidity, which is a clear competitive edge in this part of the cycle.  Second, our forward visibility has again been reduced and we will consequently revert back to managing the company quarter-by-quarter. This means a further round of capacity and overhead reductions in the fourth quarter as we adjust resources to a lower activity outlook. At the same time, we will continue to accelerate our transformation program with the next step being a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will further modernize the core part of our company. And third, our outlook for the oil market remains unchanged with a continuing tightening of the supply and demand balance as the dramatic cost in E&P investments start to take full effect, ultimately leading to an increase in oil prices. Given the conservative view our customers are taking on 2016 investment levels and the general state of the industry, following a year of low oil prices, we see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between higher oil prices and a subsequent increase in E&P investment and oilfield activity.  In this environment, we continue to proactively manage our business, to preserve our financial strength into 2016, which will allow us to better navigate the market uncertainty and to respond faster to new business opportunities and ultimately, higher activity.  Thank you for participating.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions; instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead sir.
Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from London where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paul. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paul will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind our participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information is included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. I will now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you Simon. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $0.88. This represents decreases of $0.18 sequentially and $0.49 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our second quarter revenue of $9 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the very challenging environment, pre-tax operating margins only declined by 49 basis points sequentially. This resulted in decremental margins of just 23%, which is a result of continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: second quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $2.4 billion decreased 5% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by Wireline and Testing as a result of lower exploration spending. Pre-tax operating margins decreased 84 basis points to 26.5% as an impact of the lower exploration activities was offset by increased higher margin software sales. Drilling Group revenue of $3.5 billion decreased 11%, primarily due to the further significant drop in the North America rig count. Margins remained resilient at 19.5% as the strong cost management limited the margin decline to only 44 basis points. Production Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 18% sequentially, as both activity and pricing for pressure pumping services in North America fell dramatically. Despite the severe revenue decline, margins only fell by 179 basis points to 12.8%. Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 21.1% in the second quarter. This was essentially flat when compared to the previous quarter. Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the second quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first half of 2015, we have generated $4.1 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $200 million during the second quarter and almost $0.5 billion during the first six months of the year. Net debt increased $111 million during the quarter to $5.6 billion. During the quarter, we spent $520 million to repurchase 5.8 million shares at an average price of $90 per share. We spent $587 million on CapEx during the second quarter. Full-year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paul.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thank you, Simon, and good morning everyone. Schlumberger revenue decreased 12% sequentially in the second quarter, driven by a significant reduction in land activity in the U.S. as the rig count decline accelerated, and by further pricing erosion in both North America and the international area. North America revenue fell 27% sequentially while international revenue was 5% lower, as customer budget cuts and pricing concessions impacted results for a full quarter. Despite the challenging market conditions, overall pre-tax operating margins were maintained well above the levels of previous downturns as we continue to proactively manage costs and resources, carefully navigate the commercial landscape and further accelerate our transformation program throughout the organization. The success of this approach can be seen in a double-digit pre-tax operating margin in North America and an international margin of 24.5%, which is 35 basis points up sequentially and 44 basis points up year-over-year. In the first half of 2015, year-over-year revenue has now dropped 26% in North America and 14% internationally. These levels exceed those of the 2009 downturn in both pace and size. Still, we have delivered first half decremental margins of 37% in North America and just 18% in the international area. These decremental margins represents a marked improvement over the equivalent figures from the last downturn which were in excess of 70%, particularly as we begin to approach what we believe is the market bottom. While the market remains tough, we also believe we have been successful in adapting to a rapidly changing situation as far as the size of our work force is concerned. The absence of charges in the second quarter is evidence of this, as the adjustments made in the second quarter were absorbed in our normal operating costs. In terms of corporate financial performance, we also generated almost $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter. This figure, which represents a conversion rate of 132% of the quarter's earnings into free cash flow, demonstrates our ability to generate free cash even in these market conditions. Looking at our results on a geographical basis, North American revenue decreased 27% sequentially, a figure greater than the 25% sequential decrease seen in the first quarter and, again, significantly lower than the fall in the land rig count which was down 40% sequentially in North America land. In spite of this drop, operating margins in North America decreased by only 268 basis points sequentially, leaving our margins 465 basis points higher than the same period of the 2009 downturn. The strength of this performance was underpinned by our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing impact of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management all together limiting the sequential decremental margins to 20%. In U.S., land activity was down in all basins in the second quarter with the rig count dropping below 860 for most of the month of June. In addition to the significant reduction in rig count, poor weather conditions with floods in Texas, Arkansas and Alaska also drove activity lower in the second quarter. The dramatic reduction in activity in U.S. land has created a massive capacity oversupply in the service industry with pricing quickly plummeting to unsustainable levels in particular for pressure pumping where many companies now are desperately fighting to survive. Our approach to the market remain unchanged in the second quarter where we concentrate our activity in core areas and for key customers and where we beyond this proceed with stacking of equipment rather than operating with large losses. We continue to maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term service capacity and we are working closely with our customers to help produce cost per barrel through better operational efficiency and reliability and through the application of new technology, work flows and business models. Based on this approach, we will ramp up our activity for opportunities that bring the required returns. The strength of our technology portfolio, the range of our work flow solutions and the depth of our shale understanding also enables us to pursue performance-based contracts where we initially underwrite the incremental cost of our technology and where we recover this cost plus the performance upside from incremental well production. In Western Canada, activity was also down significantly in the second quarter with the rig count falling by 66% sequentially impacted by the early spring break-up and with the recovery expected to be limited during the summer months. Offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater rig activity was down in the second quarter and activity was also impacted by loop currents while pack ice of Eastern Canada also impacted our drilling and seismic operations in the second quarter. Offshore revenue was further impacted by the expected shift in service mix from exploration to development and completions as well as increasing pricing pressure. However, the primary driver for offshore success continues to be risk reduction and project performance and we are, therefore, fully engaged with our customers to help reduce overall AFE costs through better project planning and execution. In the international markets, revenue declined by 5% sequentially driven by further budget cuts from our customers as well as further pricing concession. For the first half of the year, revenue has now dropped 14% compared to last year, a figure that is more than doubled the 5% fall experienced over the same timeframe in the 2009 downturn. Second quarter operating margins of 24.5% was up 35 basis points sequentially and 44 basis points year-over-year as first half decremental margins were held to 18% compared to 73% over the same period in the 2009 downturn. These results fully demonstrate our leadership in the international markets which is built on flawless execution from the entire organization, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program focused on work force productivity, asset utilization and reduction in unit support costs. In this environment, we focus on carefully balancing market share growth with protection of operating margin and by negotiating pricing concessions in return for additional work, integration opportunities or improved contract terms, knowing from experience that any permanent pricing concessions that we make will be very hard to recover even as market conditions improve. Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 5% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 8 basis points to 28.7%. Activity remained robust in the GCC region, however, strength in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was not sufficient to offset weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Year-on-year revenue decreased by 13%, while margins expanded by 87 basis points. In the Middle East region, our lump sum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia continued to gain momentum during the quarter however, our overall results were not immune to the customer pricing concessions we gave in the first quarter. In the United Arab Emirates, drilling and production related activity increased as work on the SARB North Island project ramped up and with further rig additions expected over the coming quarters. Drilling activity was also stronger in Kuwait, as the rig count increased in line with the country's strategic production targets, while unique land seismic activity grew with improved operational productivity. In Iraq, revenues in the north declined further in the second quarter, while activity in the south of the country remained flat sequentially but it's expected to increase in the second half of the year on the back of recent contract win. In Southeast Asia, activity fell in Australia as projects were completed both on land and offshore while activity in Malaysia declined as customer budget reductions affected both OpEx and CapEx investment. In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 81 basis points to 22.3%. Revenue was impacted once again by decreasing activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia however, somewhat offset by increased activity in Venezuela. Year-on-year revenue decreased 17% and margins grew by 111 basis points. In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly in the second quarter on further customer budget cuts that impacted both onshore and offshore activity. And in spite of new contract wins for both seismic and integrated well construction, the outlook for the second half of the year remains challenging. At the same time, the energy reform continues to progress on plan with the first major licensed award being announced in the third quarter. Offshore activity in Brazil remained weak with the deepwater rig count being down significantly versus the first quarter, while in Colombia, the activity slowdown continued and now affects all product line. In the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarkets, increased activity was driven by exploration work in Suriname and Guyana, while joint ventures in the Faja region of Venezuela continued to ramp up. Elsewhere in South America, revenue in Argentina remained resilient as growth in conventional activity partially offset pricing pressure for unconventional services. At the same time, SPM activity remains strong in Ecuador as the Shushufindi project continue to perform in line with expectations and with activity and production starting up on the new Kamana SPM project. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue fell 5% sequentially with margins edging off by 29 basis points to 21.3%. Year-on-year revenue decreased 26% and margins dropped by 85 basis points. Within the area, revenue increased in Russia and Central Asia driven by the seasonal recovery of conventional land activity and as the ruble strengthened somewhat. In the North Sea, the shift from exploration to development related activity continued, while customer budget pressure both in the U.K. and Norway resulted in lower sales of new technology. In Sub-Saharan Africa both development and exploration activity was down sequentially as customer budget pressure resulted in several active rigs being demobilized. And in Algeria, activity was slightly up sequentially while work in Libya was limited as the security situation remained very challenging. One year ago at our 2014 investor conference, we told you about our transformation program, which is designed to provide a new approach to how we run our business in order to enable fundamentally better performance. Our transformation leverages the drivers of technology innovation, equipment reliability, process efficiency, and system integration, all together delivering better management of costs, better quality of products and service delivery, and better generation of free cash flow. While we set goals for new technologies and increasing elements of service integration, we also target a 10-fold reduction in customer non-productive time, a doubling in asset utilization, a 25% reduction in inventory days, a 20% increase in workforce productivity and a 10% lowering of unit support costs. I am very pleased with the progress we have made one year later. While the transformation was designed to deliver our performance in any part of the cycle, the current market conditions have enabled us to increase customer dialogue and to accelerate the program throughout our global organization. The strength of our international margins so far this year is one demonstration of the performance impact from our transformation while the resilience in our North American margins is another proof point. In terms of costs, our figures show that we are managing all aspects very well, including both fixed and variable compensation, as well as the cost of product and service delivery. In terms of quality, the investments we have made in training, new technology and enabling systems are now really starting to pay off, as can be seen by our second quarter quality results, where we set the new record low in terms of non-productive time incurred for our customers. Last, in terms of cash, the reduction in CapEx intensity and the discipline we have shown with respect to managing working capital has delivered a very strong free cash flow in the first half of the year, with a cash conversion rate of 98%, including severance payment, which is well above our 75% target. Turning now to the overall outlook for the second half of the year, visibility still remains limited. However, some tentative signs of change are emerging. On the supply side of the oil markets, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high-cost producers is still playing out, with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show. Within OPEC, production in the second quarter was at the highest level for three years, as marketed supply was again increased at the expense of lower core spare capacity, which, in June, dropped to 2.3 million barrels per day. In addition to this, non-NAM, non-OPEC production weakened in the first half of the year by 650,000 barrels per day, driven by Brazil and Mexico, with the further softening expected in the second half of the year, as the lower investment levels in many regions start to take full effect. Against these supply figures, global oil demand growth continues to strengthen, with the IEA having revised its 2015 estimate up to 1.4 million barrels per day during the second quarter. These factors all points to a potential tightening in the global supply demand balance in the coming quarters. Turning to our industry, the largest drop in E&P investments is, as expected, occurring in North America, where 2015 spend will now largely be down by more than 35%, driven by both pricing and activity on land. We do believe that the North American rig count has now reached bottom, but that we will only see a slow increase in drilling and completion activity in the second half of the year, which will not make any material dent in the massive overcapacity that has been created. This again means that there will be little to no improvement in pricing levels and, hence, the market will still remain very challenging for the foreseeable future. In the international market, E&P spending is now expected to fall more than 15%, driven by lower activity in most regions and further amplified by a very strong dollar, in particular, versus the Russian ruble and the Venezuelan bolivar. Given the nature of the business in the international markets, we do not expect any upward adjustment to existing customer budgets for the second half of 2015. Instead, we see a continuation of the trends from the first half, with very low exploration activity, tight management of development related spend, and continued pricing pressure for our products and services. However, we do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016, or through exploration and development related activity. In the midst of the current market challenges, we remain focused on the things we can control, including our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise, and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide to our customers. The success of this approach is enabling us to maintain solid international margins despite a significant drop in activity, and at the same time, also allowing us to maximize our performance in North America. We remain very confident in our capacity to weather the current downturn better than our surroundings, and also significantly better than what we have done in previous downturns. Our global strength, our technology differentiation, and our accelerated corporate transformation is creating a great platform for us to increase revenue market share, post lower earnings per share reductions than our peers, and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity to deliver unmatched levels of free cash flow. And at the same time, this financial strength positions us well to take advantage of increasing market opportunities resulting from the current market environment. Thank you very much. We will now open up for Q&A.
Operator: And first, with the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And thank you very much, and I think you're going to make it a difficult weekend for some of your peers since they ponder what they're going to say next week. But...
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thank you.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wonder whether we could revisit your macro view. Are you more confident or less confident that the oil markets are tightening than what you were a quarter ago, given the most recent IEA report and some of the resolutions around previously sanctioned countries?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, I think our view on the macro and our confidence in the tightening I think is relatively unchanged. We've been saying now, I think, for a number of quarters, that we see solid oil demand growth. And again, this was revised upwards again this year to 1.4 million barrels during the second quarter. And we've also said that, with a certain lag, the large cuts in E&P investments are going to show up in the supply numbers. And we see it in particular in non-NAM and OPEC, which has showed a gradual weakening over the first six months of this year. U.S. monthly sequential production is flattening and the core OPEC spare capacity was also down to only 2.3 million barrels in June, a million barrels per day. So I think the tightening that we've been foreshadowing, we are still relatively confident that that will happen in the second half of the year.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, good. On the environment, as you highlighted, pricing is still tough. I mean, we're at the trough. But clearly, the trough means, probably, average pricing still rolling down. And how do you see the say, some of the second half pricing and macro headwinds relative to the momentum that you have created within the organization? It's very clear from what you're delivering here that some of the initiatives that you initiated, maybe a year ago are really starting to deliver. But how much more can we expect given what you're already doing?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, I mean, you're asking whether our results are sustainable, I guess, right? So I mean, if...
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, I mean, the headwinds relative to the internal momentum, how should we think about it?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, if we take the pricing part of the question first, I would agree with you that there is going to be a further impact on pricing in the second half of the year. We haven't seen the full impact of that. But I would say that there is probably still more relative impact in North America than what it is in the international markets. There is going to be impact in both regions in Q3 beyond where we are in Q2, but I think that's relatively larger in North America. As to our ability to offset this, the transformation and the general way that we are managing the company and the focus we have on cost and resource management, through this, we are going to continue to create a financial leverage over the coming years. And we are going to take that leverage out in two forms. We will take it out through market share gains by being able to be even more competitive on price. And secondly, we'll take the other part out through very strong incrementals when we grow. Or, alternatively, very strong decrementals when we shrink. So what we talked about in 2014 at the Investor Day in terms of what the transformation represents for the company, say, in the next five-year horizon, it is there. We are accelerating the impact from it. And we see this leverage as something that we will continuously take out in the coming years. So fundamentally, I think the performance that we are posting is sustainable. It's not going to be a straight line. But overall, what we are doing now is not a fluke.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, very impressive. Thank you very much. And Simon, congratulations with the free cash conversion. I'll hand it back.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning guys.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Good morning.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): How do you see the performance-based work evolving in the U.S.? I know you've won projects internationally in the quarter in your SPM work in Ecuador and other places, internationally. But can you talk about the issues with growing that business model in the U.S.?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: That's a good question. So I think, I would mention two specific things here. I think, firstly, what is very positive at this stage is that customers are, more and more, starting to buy in to the fact that we have technologies and workflows that can create more value. That is what we've been investing in for the past five years and that is how we wanted to try to create technical differentiation in the largely commoditized North American market. So with the dialogues we have with customers, both on geoengineering completions, on refracturing, in terms of more sophisticated fracturing fluid systems like broadband, it is very clear that the appetites to use new technology and more sophisticated technology is growing. Now, some of the customers would take on that technology on a more of a standard type of contract, where we will still get a premium over what basic commodity type of technologies we'll give, while other customers will also like to go into a more risk-based contract setup. We are fine either way. We are looking to create technology differentiation, and I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to push that forward in the coming quarters, even in this business environment.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, if I could, there has been a great deal made about the slowdown in deepwater project development, FID delays and major oil companies moving to onshore. Yesterday, we saw Conoco break a contract on almost a new rig. Can you talk about what Schlumberger sees in terms of the progress in deepwater development and how that's changed what you expect to see going forward, if you would, whatever, over the next couple of years?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, the immediate thing we see is, obviously, an impact on deepwater drilling activity. And this is largely focused in on the exploration side of deepwater. And that's a, it's a pretty significant reduction in that. Now, that is already incorporated or absorbed in our results where they stand today. In terms of the deepwater projects, I think, yes, there are some projects that are being delayed and some projects being canceled, if possible, but I think in general, these are long-term investments, many of them are already deeply committed. So we don't see any kind of dramatic impact at this stage on the projects that are in the pipeline. Now, going forward, in terms of sanctioning new projects, I think it's going to be very important for the industry to be able to – the service industry together with our customers to be able to come up with technical solutions and field development plans that significantly reduces cost per barrel. And if we can do that, which is the overall objective for the industry, I think we can make many of the pending deepwater projects also economically viable in the future.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay gentleman. Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thank you Jim.
Operator: Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks guys. I echo, certainly a good quarter, particularly with the decremental margins. So Paal, can you talk a little bit more about the decrementals? Obviously strong in North America and international, but specific to North America, can you talk about at least for the Q2 the impact of the transformation efforts versus new technology versus the head count? And also, are you seeing better uptakes from the new technologies this cycle than in prior downturns?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Yes. I think, basically, all the elements that you listed are the contributing factors to the lower decrementals. So obviously, we have a clean quarter this quarter. There are no charges in it, so this is basically straight-line business performance in the second quarter. And like you said, the overall impact on transformation, which we started several years earlier in North America, is part of driving this. We started our transformation and reorganization back in 2010. I would say our North American organization has also been very proactive when it comes to cost and resource management. And as we just talked about earlier on one of the questions there, the uptake of new technology, both in North America and international, the rate of uptake, given the downturn, is actually quite strong and actually much higher than what we have seen in any previous downturns. So I think that comes down to the fact that a lot of the technologies – new technology we now have out have very clear cost and efficiency angles to them, which means that they sell equally easy in the downturn as they do in the upturn.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate the clarity. And then, you referenced it briefly in your remarks regarding the international outlook for 2016, which is, obviously, very preliminary, but based on your recent conversations and thinking through your viewpoints on supply/demand for crude, if we are in a $65 Brent world, what would your preliminary thoughts or color be on E&P CapEx on the international markets and do you have any color on the region?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, I think it's too early to make any firm predictions on E&P CapEx investments internationally next year. I would just say that we are relatively confident in the tightening of the supply/demand balance of the second half of the year. That would, under normal circumstances, lead to some uptick in the oil price. And if we see some improvement in the oil price in the second half of this year, I don't think there is going to be any huge impact on the current year budget, but I think it's a positive indicator that we might have some increase next year. I don't think the increase in 2016 is going to be large, but I think there is a good chance that E&P investment levels next year will be higher than what we've seen in 2015.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to David Anderson with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Paal, I just want to ask about Iran. Obviously, assuming there is an Iran deal goes through, I just wanted to know if you could highlight a little bit of Schlumberger's service opportunities that opens up over the next few years. And would you expect IOCs to start moving aggressively in there?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, I think what the IOCs are going to do, I think, you are going to have to ask them. I don't know. Our position and our view on Iran is the following: we have fully exited Iran. When the sanctions are lifted and when it is permissible, we will evaluate going back in. So beyond that, I don't really have anything more to say about what we will do, but it's coming down to, firstly, that the sanction needs to be officially lifted, which they are not yet done.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, as a quick follow-up on the offshore. Can I get a little bit more detail? You've talked a few times about exploration spending coming down. I was just wondering if you can just help me understand how you see this exploration cycle playing out, say over the next 12 months. Do you think exploration can bottom by the fourth quarter? And then, at these costs, you talked about risk reduction in some of these contracts, do you think you could start seeing some sort of impact, some sort of turnaround in there by mid-2016, or something along those lines?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: I would say, potentially. We see the exploration spend down potentially around 30% again this year. That's including seismic, probably around the same level. So that is obviously a dramatic reduction if you look at what we already saw in 2014, right? So yes, we might not be too far away from bottom on exploration spend. But again, I don't see any dramatic turnaround immediately. We could potentially start seeing something towards the second half of 2016, if there is a kind of a gradual uptick of the oil price to at least plus/minus $70. But nothing on the horizon, as we see today. It's still a very tough market. And we see this very, very clearly in some of our key high tech product lines, where our exploration revenue over the past six quarters has actually dropped by 35%. So I don't think we are too far away from bottom because there's not that much left to cut. But the comeback I think is still a little bit out in time. But if you look at the level of spend today versus what is required for the industry to replace reserves and to find new oil field developments, we are obviously way under-investing. So this is not a sustainable situation. So the uptick will have to come. It's just that we don't see it on the immediate horizon.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI: Hey. Good morning Paal, or good afternoon, I guess, Paal, and congratulations on a well executed quarter. I had a question really related to the technology and technology uptake. It seems like this cycle is somewhat different than we've seen in previous cycles, where the technology uptake is actually greater. Last year, I think 27% of your revenues were from new technologies. Do you have a sense of – can you give us a number of what in terms of revenues, you're seeing in terms of new technology today, or maybe the first half of this year?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Yeah, so what we've seen so far this year, in terms of new technology as a percentage of our total technologies or the total revenue, is 22%. Now, this is slightly lower than the 25% target that we laid out last year. But given where we are in the cycle, this is dramatically higher than what we have seen in any previous cycle, right? So yes, we are selling a significantly higher rate of new technology in this part of the cycle versus previous. And as I said earlier, this is down to, I think, the fact that we have a very flush new technology portfolio and offering, and I think we have been doing a better job in clearly demonstrating to our customers what these new technologies bring, in terms of lower cost per barrel, in terms of efficiency, in terms of higher production. And this is, again, why I think the uptake, although it's slightly down from where it was in the second half of 2014, it is still holding up very, very well.
James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI: Okay, thanks. And then kind of an unrelated follow-up here. On the third quarter in particular, clearly, we are going to see continued declines in revenue internationally and probably some margin degradation. In North America, do you still expect to see a significant revenue degradation and marked degradation as well? Could you give us some clarity on kind of how we should think about 3Q, and is 3Q the bottom?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Okay, well, let's start up with the beginning. So in terms of revenue, we expect that the sequential drop is going to slow in Q3, and it could potentially represent bottom when it comes to revenue. Now, if you look at Q1, we saw a 19% sequential decline, in Q2, we saw a 12% sequential decline in revenue. So for the third quarter, we expect something in the range of 5%, 6% further decline in sequential revenue.
James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI: Okay.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Now, if you look at the two main parts of the world, in North America, we do expect a slight increase on activity on land. But again, we see this being offset by weakening also offshore activity and further pricing pressure, both on land and offshore and internationally no major change. We think the overall weak activity is going to continue and also there's going to be sustained pricing pressure. In addition, we have the slowing down of activity for part of Q3 in the Middle East and also the maintenance fees in the North Sea. Now, if you look at this cycle, so far we have proactively managed costs to protect margins. And I think we demonstrated that we are pretty quick on our feet and we can manage this very, very well. At this stage, our structure cost and our field capacity is really tailored to our Q2 activity level. But for now, we have decided to preserve our current structure for Q3, and this is in order to be ready for increased activity as we go forward. So provided this is for a limited period of time, we are prepared to live with the temporary margin impact that carrying these slightly elevated levels of resources is going to have. It's not going to be a huge impact on margins, but it's going to be a little bit more than what we could have managed if we were to cut even deeper. So if you look at EPS, it's going to come down in Q3, and I think the current consensus of $0.77 is a pretty realistic number.
James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI: Okay, perfect. Thanks, Paal.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Good morning. Going back to an earlier question, but I wanted to be more specific with regard to discussing the attempt at improved alignment with customers. Looking at three buckets, if you could talk specifically about refracking in terms of uptake, number of projects wins, what have you, engineering completions in the similar vein? And also on the deepwater front, getting more aligned and paid on the AFE versus NPT?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Okay, so if we start off with the land part, right? So on geoengineering completions in North America, we have over the past quarter engaged and are in contract – either we have signed contracts or either in contract discussions with several customers – on doing consistently geoengineering completions for them. And with refracturing, we are already engaged with eight different customers in North America land on doing refracturing for them. So both of these elements are picking up nicely. As I said earlier, some of the customers would like to go with traditional contracts where they just pay us a technology premium for what we bring, and others are still considering whether to go into a performance-based setup. And either way, we are fine. The main thing, as I said, we are looking to create technology differentiation. And again, this is going quite well.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: If there is any resistance to your underwriting the cost of a refrac or an engineering completions, what is it exactly? What would be the resistance on the part of a customer from actually allowing you to do that?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, I think the only resistance will be the fact that when they see that we are prepared to do it, it must be a pretty good business proposition. And I think when they look at this in more detail, they'll figure out that there is no need for us to carry the cost because they happily will carry the cost because it's a good investment. So I think that's really the main – so there is no resistance. It's just a reflection of, do they want to capture more of the value themselves or would they like to outsource all the risk and potentially much more of the upside to us?
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: And at this juncture with regard to the uptake on the land front, is it an even split between standard contracts and more of the underwritten contracts?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: I think at this stage, I would say it is probably more so standard contracts with the pricing premium rather than having to underwrite it. We offer underwriting to all of them but most of them actually do take more of a standard type of contract.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. And any comments on the deepwater front?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, in terms of changing the business model on deepwater and being, I would say, more compensated on performance rather than standard type of contracts, it is not that much movement on that front. We are discussing with some of our larger customers various types of framework. We haven't concluded any of these yet, but I would say there have been good kind of productive discussions. It takes a bit more time. These are larger projects. It's a bit more complicated to do than kind of the single well things we can do on land. But I would say we have good discussions and a good dialogue, and I think there is openness from our customers to invite us to the table and basically have us participate more, but nothing really material in terms of new contracts signed yet.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. And last one for me, your final sort of comment or one of them with regard to your opening narrative was referencing your balance sheet strength and your free cash flow generation, thus allowing you to take increased advantage of market opportunities. Can you elaborate on that? I assume in part that means acquisitions?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Simon, you want to comment on our use of free cash flow?
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: You know our priority to cash is still as we always declared. We will fuel the growth of the business and you've seen a slowdown on the CapEx because of times. But obviously, we continue to invest in SPM and multiclient. As far as acquisition, we do small ones on regular basis, and this is also funded through cash. We don't borrow for that kind of acquisition, but we will remain to be opportunistic on that front. But as I said, smaller acquisition that regular as far as to our use of cash.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, good morning. I guess good afternoon where you guys are. Congratulations on a very well executed run, Paal, over the last 12 months.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thank you very much.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Welcome. You indicated here that you're carrying a cost structure that is sized for kind of second quarter activity and willing to kind of deal with some near-term margin dynamics related with that cost structure if activity comes in a little bit more. I don't want to be too presumptuous, but then I would assume that you wouldn't want to sit for too much longer than one quarter with some sort of a margin drag. So can we maybe infer from your comments you're expecting a increase in activity, generally speaking, in the fourth quarter, that would be for North America, and then maybe international as soon as the first quarter of next year?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Yeah, I think you can read into this that – firstly, I think, we are pleased with how we've handled the downturn so far. We decided to be rather decisive in rightsizing the workforce for the downturn we are facing, and that includes both rightsizing and streamlining the support structure as well as the field capacity. So I think what you can read into the comments on the fact that we are prepared to carry slightly more costs into Q3, and this is not a significant part, it's slightly more, that is that we are indeed looking to be ready for growth in activity. Now, I can't say 100% certain that it's going to come in Q4 or Q1, but what we're saying is that we believe we are getting close to bottom. We believe that we have demonstrated very clearly our ability to manage cost and resources, and in the event the upturn is a couple of quarters away, we are prepared to carry the cost, and I think that would be a much better management of our resources to enable us to be well prepared and positioned for the growth, and in the event it's pushed out a bit more, we can also do further adjustments, that's relatively easy. We have shown that we can do it. So yes, you can infer that we are looking and searching for the uptick and that we think that we are pretty close to bottom.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. That's great color. I appreciate that. Now, in the context of the margin performance in the international markets for the second quarter and we roll through into the third quarter, how can – like if I look from the outside in, I would have to say to myself, if you did so well in the second quarter, I assume you can do probably equally as well in the third quarter, right, because you're sized for it, you've been positioned for it. So why would margins come down internationally in the third quarter versus the second quarter?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, I can't say that they would or they wouldn't. I mean, obviously we would still like to maintain them where they are. We will internationally as well carry, I would say, slightly more resources than what is necessary for the third quarter. We see revenue coming down still a little bit from the second quarter level, and we could have shed some more resources to be prepared for that. I think the only reason why the margins would come down I would say, in general, would be that we are carrying slightly more resources. There is also a further pricing effect that comes into it. But obviously offsetting this is, is the continued impact from transformation, right? So I would say if we decided to go forward and completely align resources to activity, we should be able to absorb a large part of the pricing. I think the way we are going now, you could potentially see a little bit of margin drop in Q3, but that will be more by design. The fact that we are willing to carry a bit more resources, rather than not being able to effectively maintain it.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right, that's great. And if I just – just on the pricing front, on the international dynamics, what area are you seeing the most pricing in terms of geographic and what product lines are coming under the most pressure right now?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: In the international market?
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, obviously, the product line that has been the most effective so far is WesternGeco on the seismic side, which has been now going on for a good, about, six-odd quarters, right? So I think our team in WesternGeco has done a tremendous job in streamlining the cost structure, improving how we operate our fleets. So we are very well positioned to kind of maximize our performance on the marine seismic business the way it is today. But that's probably where we have seen the most. In terms of geography, you see it more or less everywhere, both on land and offshore, actually. But we've seen it in some of the large markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, the North Sea, even on land in the Middle East we have a significant pricing pressures, so we are navigating the landscape and we are – we have to give concessions, but we try to trade the concessions for something in return, either better terms and conditions, more integration opportunities, higher market share. And whatever is left to be offset, we are trying to offset with the leverage we are creating from the transformation.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, that's great, Paal. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to Jim Crandell with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning Paal. What impact is the pending merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes having on the awarding of business outside of North America?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: It's a bit difficult for me to say what the impact is. I mean that's more of a customer question, right? I think it obviously creates a bit of uncertainty from our customers. Firstly, is the transaction going to go through? If it goes through then it's from three to two players. If it doesn't go through, then obviously that warrants a different approach to how they potentially would like to award. So I think it creates uncertainty from the customer side as to how they go about awarding in tender situation, and it has probably also led to potentially slightly lower rate of tendering in this part of the cycle. This is the ideal time for most of our customers to tender given the fact that they know activity is down. So I think it's – that is probably one impact that it has. If you look at our performance, I'm actually very pleased with our tender win rate in the first half of the year. I think we have done very well. I'm pleased with some of the key wins that we have taken on, and for me that should bode well, I think, for market share evolution in the second half of this year and into 2016.
Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC: And do you think you've won market share year-to-date internationally in the areas that you compete with Halliburton and Baker?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Yeah, there is nothing in our revenue numbers in H1 as of yet, but if you look at the amount of contract volume we have won, I believe we have won a higher share of the contracts out for bid than what our current market share is, which means that over time, we should gain share.
Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, good.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: As these contracts are implemented, yeah.
Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, good. And as a follow-up question, I have on the U.S. pressure pumping business, in this kind of environment that we're in today, are there many instances where customers are willing to differentiate and pay for technology?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Well, if you look at the total business volume in North America land, it is not a high percentage yet. But I would say it's a growing number of customers that are willing to have a much more open technology discussion with us. And they see the importance, I think, of moving away focus entirely from driving down the well costs to driving down the cost per barrel for the production that they have. And the only way to do that now going forward as we are nearing the assumed total of how cheaply you can drill and complete these wells you're going to have to get more production out of them. And I think it's very evident that the only way to get that done is through new technology and new workload.
Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Doug Becker with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Paal, maybe sticking with the pressure pumping topic. You highlighted unsustainability of where that business stands right now. How do you expect this to play out? Does the capacity simply shift to stronger hands, or do you see some meaningful capacity reductions?
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: No, I think what you find in any of these commoditized markets, if companies go under, there might be a temporary impact on capacity, as the capacity shifts hands. But most likely, whatever capacity is in the market today will likely resurface with some other ownership, once those type of transactions are sorted out, right? So I don't think it's going to be a permanent capacity reduction from companies potentially going under. I think these assets will shift hands and resurface with different ownership.
Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That makes sense. Then maybe a quick one for Simon. In the past, you've mentioned getting payback on severance costs within a year. Is that on track, and does this simplistically mean cost savings of something around $750 million in 2015? And I'm just arriving at that number by summing up the severance costs from fourth quarter to second quarter.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So it is on track. It is, as we confirm, within one year. I'm not too sure about your number, but your logic is correct. If you take what we have declared, as far as the payments are concerned, this will be recovered less than a year.
Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And are the remaining head count reductions more concentrated in North America or internationally?
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We are almost completed with what we have done. There is no more reduction.
Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Has that skewed more North America or internationally?
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, North America was a – percentage-wise was higher, but it was global, yes. Global.
Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Understood. Thank you very much.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that will be our last question. I'll turn it back to the presenters for any closing remarks.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO: All right, thank you. So before we close, I would like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the market evolution in the second quarter was the continuation of what we saw in the first quarter, with North America land rig count falling further and with pricing pressure increasing in both North America and international markets. In response to this, we have proactively managed what remains under our control and subsequently delivered our best cost and cash performance so far in any downturn. Second, our strong performance has been amplified by the acceleration of our transformation program, which is being actively implemented throughout our global organization, and which has enabled us to increase pre-tax operating margins in the international areas and maintain double-digit margins in North America. Third, we believe that we now have seen the bottom of the rig count decline in North America and that North America land activity will see a slow increase in the second half of this year, while service pricing is expected to decline further in the third quarter as the fight for market share continues to play out. In the international markets, we expect no upward revision to E&P CapEx spend for remainder of 2015, as the trend of low exploration activity, tight management of development spend, and sustained pricing pressure is likely set to continue. Based on this, the third quarter could potentially represent the bottom of the cycle in terms of earnings per share, as the pace of the revenue drop is set to slow and as we continue our steadfast efforts to maximize operating margins in both North America and international markets. And with the streamlining of our cost and resource base undertaken in the past nine months, together with the acceleration of our transformation program, we remain very optimistic about our ability to deliver unmatched incremental margins as soon as E&P investments start to show any signs of growth. That concludes today's call. Thank you very much for attending.

Operator: Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our first comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information, is included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges earning credits, was $1.06. This represents decreases of $0.44 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded $439 million of pretax charges. This includes $390 million of charges associated with the headcount reduction of 11,000, as well as an incentivized leave of absence program. This program provides us with some flexibility as we manage the uncertainties of the current environment. In Venezuela, during the first quarter, the SICAD II exchange rate of VEF50 to $1 was eliminated and replaced with a new system known as SIMADI. The SIMADI rate was approximately VEF192 as of the end of the quarter. As a result, we recorded $49 million of devaluation charge during the first quarter. After this charge, the U.S. dollar value of our Bolivar denominated net assets is not material. Therefore, any further devaluations of the Bolivar will not have a significant impact on our results. Our first quarter revenue of $10.2 billion decreased 19% sequentially, while pretax operating margin decreased 255 basis points. Approximately 25% of the sequential revenue decline was attributable to the currency effect and the absence of the year-end increase in product, software and multi-client sales that we experienced last quarter. The remaining decrease was driven by activity and price declines. Despite the very challenging environment, pretax operating margin declined 255 basis points sequentially which resulted in incremental margins of only 33%. This is a result of prompt and proactive cost management across the organization. It's worth noting that although our revenue was significantly impacted by the fall in value of many currencies, this phenomenon does not have a significant impact on our pretax operating income. This reflects the benefit of our local cost structure which largely serves as the natural hedge against currency movements on our bottom line. Highlights by both product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion, decreased 21% sequentially, while margins decreased 447 basis points, to 25.7%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower multi-client and software sales and a fall in higher margin exploration activity. Drilling group revenue of $4 billion decreased 15% sequentially, while margins only declined 80 basis points. These declines were primarily driven by the severe rig count drop in North America. Production group revenue of $3.8 billion decreased 22% sequentially and margins fell by 389 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and pricing pressure in North America land. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 20.9% in the first quarter, compared to 21.4% in the previous quarter. This decrease reflects the fact that we generated a smaller portion of our pretax income in North America during Q1. As we [indiscernible] throughout the year, the EPR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. We generated almost $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and net debt increased $100 million during the quarter, to $5.5 billion. This is all despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1 which is driven by the annual associated with employee compensation, as well as the payment of $245 million in severance during the quarter. Even with the challenges of the current market, we still anticipate generating very strong free cash flow. This is because, during the downturn, we continue to reduce our investment in CapEx and working capital requirements will also come down. This combination should more than offset the decrease in earnings. During the quarter, we spent $719 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares, at an average price of $82.98. We spent $606 million on CapEx, full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multi-client and SBM investment, is now expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated pricing pressure. International activity was lower, as customers cut budgets in response to lower commodity prices and was also impacted by the normal seasonal effects in the northern hemisphere and the fall of certain local currencies against the U.S. dollar. In spite of these top line headwinds, we have been able to minimize the impact on our pretax operating margins, to prompt and proactive cost management and by further accelerating our transformation program. This is reflected in our first quarter international margins which are essentially flat sequentially and are up year-over-year. We have also delivered better decrementals than in any previous downturn, with sequential decremental margins as low as 33%, with North America and the international areas achieving 39% and 25%, respectively. The pace and magnitude of the activity reductions, particularly in North America, has been almost unprecedented and we have to go back to the mid-1980s to find anything similar. And while we thought we had adequate plans in place going into the quarter, activity declined even faster than expected which required us to revise our plans accordingly. This made managing the quarter challenging, including the decision to further reduce our workforce by 11,000 employees, bringing the total personnel reduction to 20,000 or around 15%, compared to the peak of the third quarter of 2014. Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow, before restructuring payments, during the first quarter. And we remain confident in our ability to generate free cash, even in these market conditions. And we expect to maintain the cash quality of our earnings by continuing to convert 75% or more of our net income into free cash flow. By geography, our North American revenue decreased 25% sequentially which was significantly lower than the 32% drop in land rig count. Operating margins in North America decreased 670 basis points sequentially, to 12.9%. In spite of these severe activity and pricing declines, sequential decrementals were limited to 39%, as we maintain -- as we remain fully focused on flawless execution and proactive cost management. In U.S. land, drilling and stimulation activity was down in all basins, while activity also dropped significantly in Canada, while the reduction in rig count was further impacted by the early Spring breakup. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity was resilient in the first quarter, although we're seeing a steady change in service mix from exploration towards development work, driven by budget cuts from most of our customers. On land in North America, pricing pressure was greatest for hydraulic fracturing services, although some of this impact was mitigated to increase new technology uptake, particularly for our BroadBand stimulation services and Infinity completions products. In spite of this, market pricing for certain products and services has already reached unsustainable levels; however, we're being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss making contracts. We continue to work with our customers to have lower drilling and completion costs, by focusing on the savings that new virtuals and technologies can bring. We're doing this through our technology integration groups, that house the full arrangement of shale expertise, spanning formation evaluation, drilling, stimulation and completions. The experts making up these integration groups are located in the larger shale basins in North America land and have both the scientific understanding of how to optimize shale developments and also an in-depth knowledge of our complete technology offering which they combine to design the best solution for each reservoir and each well. The track record we have established over the past five years has now given us the confidence to propose a range of new business models to our customers, where we initially absorb the incremental cost linked to our work flows and technologies, in return for an upside based on the actual production results. One example of our unique shale technologies is HiWAY which helps customers increase production and ultimate recovery while using less water and proppant. In the period between 2012 and 2014, wells completed with HiWAY technology in the Eagle Ford showed a 26% increase in the best three months of production, compared to wells stimulated with conventional treatments. HiWAY technology also helped save around 1.4 billion gallons of fracturing fluid and about 2.8 billion pounds of proppant, in more than 1,000 wells. The success of the HiWAY technology is now being complimented and extended by the rapid uptake of BroadBand Sequence which has already shown remarkable performance for a range of customers in both new well completions and in refracturing of old wells. In the international markets, revenue declined 16% sequentially, driven by seasonal weather impact, currency effects and customer spending cuts. But despite the severity of the sequential revenue decline and the unfavorable shift in revenue mix, we managed to minimize the impact on our pretax operating margins which was essentially flat with the previous quarter, at 24.1%. This performance was achieved by strong execution, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program. Which together, were able to offset the margin impact from both reduced activity and the pricing pressure we were seeing from all customer groups. In terms of managing the pricing pressure, we remain fully focused on navigating the commercial landscape by carefully balancing the pursuit of market share with the protection of operating margins and by always aiming to trade any pricing concessions for additional work scope or better contract terms. Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 13% sequentially, while pretax operating margin improved by 30 basis points, to 28.6%. Performance was impacted by a double-digit sequential drop in revenue in the Asia Pacific region and by lower product and software sales, but was partially offset by robust activity in the DTC region. Year-on-year revenue decreased 5% and margins grew by 230 basis points. In the Middle East region, our lump-sum turnkey projects in Saudi Arabia gained momentum during the first quarter and we expect solid drilling activity going forward, together with more fracturing and rigless work. In the United Arab Emirates, development activity on the North Island of the [indiscernible] project has now started, with more rig additions planned over the next few quarters. On this project, Schlumberger has been awarded the five-year contract for the supply of integrated well construction services, with further details provided in our earnings press release. Activity in the rest of the DCC countries was also strong in the first quarter. While in Iraq, revenues in the North remain muted, at around half of the peak levels seen in 2014 and activity in the South of the country was steady around the levels seen in the fourth quarter. In Southeast Asia, activity in China was seasonally lower in the first quarter, but activity also declined in the rest of the regions, as customer budget cuts continued to be implemented. In Latin America, revenue declined 20% sequentially, while pretax operating margin improved 59 basis points, to 21.5%. Revenue was impacted by decreased activity in Mexico, Brazil and Columbia, as customer budgets were cut and also by the fall in the value of the Venezuelan Bolivar. Still, these effects were partially offset by slight activity increases in Venezuela, Argentina and Ecuador. Year-on-year revenue decreased 6% and margins grew by 39 basis points. In Venezuela, activity continued to improve with [indiscernible] and with several of the joint ventures in the Faja, while activity is also ramping up in Trinidad. In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget cuts, as well as seasonal weather effects that mainly impacted offshore activity. The reduced spend mainly affected non-development activity, although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in Latin America, offshore activity in Brazil remains weak, with a deepwater slowdown continuing, as Petrobras announced budget cuts early in the quarter. In Argentina, activity remains resilient in the first quarter, driven by simulation work and continued new technology uptake in the Vaca Muerta and with new project startups offsetting the completion of others. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenues fell 17% sequentially, with margins declining by 133 basis points, to 21%. Year-on-year revenue decreased 12% and margins grew by 66 basis points. The revenue decline was mainly due to continued weakness in the ruble and lower seasonal activity in Russia. In the UK North Sea, exploration activity fell to its lowest level in recent history, as customer spending decelerated, while rig count in the Norwegian sector appears to have reached a bottom. In Sub-Sahara Africa, both development and exploration activity was down sequentially across the region. In Algeria, our activity was flat sequentially, while work in Libya was limited to offshore locations, with onshore operations largely shut down for the quarter. Looking at the industry as a whole, the current financial challenges will not disappear, even if oil prices were to recover to the levels seen in recent years. The industry is therefore forced to seek new ways of working together to reduce costs and create more project value. And we have seen a much closer collaboration between operators and large service companies, as a significant opportunity to create technical solutions that will achieve these objectives. At Schlumberger, we're ready to enter into these types of collaborations. And based on our technical and financial strength, we're also prepared to promote more risk-based contract models, where we're compensated based on the solutions we have designed, as well as on the performance of our execution. And these contract structures are currently being tabled with a number of customers as part of the ongoing commercial discussions. Turning to the 2015 outlook, visibility still remains limited. However, we expect the largest open in E&P investments to occur in North America, where 2015 spend is expected to be down by more than 30%. We further believe that a recovery in U.S. land drilling activity will be pushed out in time, as the inventory of uncompleted wells builds and as the refracturing market expands. We also anticipate that our recovery in North America land activity will fall well short of reaching previous levels, hence extending the period of weak pricing. In the international market, we expect 2015 E&P spend to fall around 15% which will create challenges in terms of both activity and pricing levels, but considerably less than the headwinds seen in North America. The reduction in international spend will be seen primarily through lower activity levels, but also with some pricing impact for basic technologies and with a continuation of the already observed shift from exploration-related services towards more development activity. In terms of geography, we expect the G to C states of the Middle East to increase investments in 2015, as the core part of OPEC prepares to recoup market share, as the rest of the global supply base continues to weaken. Elsewhere, we expect to see a double-digit reduction in E&P investment levels in Latin America, led by Mexico and Brazil. In Europe and Africa, led by the North Sea and Sub-Sahara Africa. And in Asia, led by China, Malaysia and Australia. In Russia, conventional land activity in western Siberia continues to be resilient, but the overall revenue contribution from Russia will remain subdued until there is a meaningful recovery in the ruble exchange rate. While the global fall in activity level is severe, we remain focused on the things we can control which are our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide. We remain confident in our ability to weather the storm better than our surroundings, based on our favorable international leverage, our fair technology leadership in North America shale and the acceleration of our transformation program. These elements will together create the platform that should allow us to increase revenue market share from slower earnings per share reductions that our peers in the coming quarters and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity, while delivering on matched levels of free cash flow. Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. First question is from Ole Slorer. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer: Yes, thanks a lot and congrats with some pretty magnificent effects on the efficiency initiatives that you're implementing. But my opening question would be, Paal, if you could just update us on your macro thoughts, the same way as you did on the previous two quarters? And your comments that the markets might be tightening in the second half of the year, particularly with respect to how you see non-OPEC, non-U.S., that 50 million barrel a day bracket, be affected by the lack of investment that we've seen over the past couple of years?
Paal Kibsgaard: So our view on the macro hasn't really changed, compared to what we said both on the October and January call. First of all, the 2015 oil demand remains strong. And I was actually right [indiscernible] in the latest IA report. It would now be about 1.1 million barrels per day. While on the supply side, we continue to see the market share battle playing out globally. Now the key question, as we discussed before, is when and where the large cuts in E&P investment is going to show up in the supply numbers. And the latest production data from March is now showing the first signs of a tightening in supply. And we're basically looking at three main indicators. The first one is the core OPEC spare capacity which was down by 400,000 barrels in March, to 2.5 million barrels. The other one is the one you alluded to which is the non-NAM and OPEC production which showed a slight weakening in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. And given the reduction in E&P spend internationally; we expect this weakening to continue throughout this year. And the third one which everyone is looking at, is the U.S. monthly sequential production which is now showing the first signs of flattening. So based on this, as we said in January, we expect the global supply to continue to tighten in the second half of this year, so really no major change to our view on the macro.
Ole Slorer: And the follow-up question will just be on where you think you stand on your goals that you outlined at the analyst day last summer? I think you mentioned that you expected to be in the sixth to seventh inning or something like that, by 2017. But it looks as if things are going at lot faster. So just in terms of this understanding the momentum and how much more there is to -- juice there is to squeeze out of this lemon, could you give us your latest view on that?
Paal Kibsgaard: So if you look at how we're driving business performance today which a lot of the focus is around managing decrementals, there is really three components that are part of driving this performance. First is the transformation of the mindset of our entire organization, where we have, in the past couple years, taken teamwork and the tightness of the chain of command to a completely new level. So this allows us now to plan and execute and also to adjust with great pace and agility, all right And this is the process that had been going on for a number of years. And I think it really demonstrated the -- our capabilities, coming from this transformation and in the first quarter. Now the second is just diligent focus on basic cost and resource management. And this includes both our internal cost structures, as well as the third party spend. And although we did well in the first quarter in this area, as well, these efforts are going to continue into the second quarter. And then the third one is really the one that you're referring to which is the structural transformation of how we run the entire company. And here, we said we would be in the sixth to seventh inning in 2017. I would say that today, we're probably in the third inning, if you want to stick to baseball terminology. It's a multi-year program. It's going to bring a steady contribution to our performance and we're today active in looking to accelerate the pace of this implementation and there is a great pool from the entire organization now to accelerate this and I'm very pleased with the overall progress, in terms of how we're doing.
Operator: Thank you. Next question from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: I wanted to actually reference your presentation of a few weeks ago which I thought was one of the better efforts, not only from Schlumberger but just from any industry participant in some time, so first of all with regard to a question regarding business model. You've referenced this in your earnings release, you've also referenced it several times, being prepared to move to more risk-based business models. And specifically, the significant opportunity associated with the re-fracking of older wells. So what kind of uptake are you seeing, with regard to the re-fracking opportunity? And when you describe this as a significant opportunity, can you quantify what that means, in terms of how large it is?
Paal Kibsgaard: If you look at the work we've done so far and we posted some of the recent results in the earnings press release this quarter, a lot of the re-frack focus so far has been around being able to identify the candidates. And that's based on our understanding of the existing completions and the potential that these still hold. And then the other part is around, how do you effectively do the refracturing while minimizing the costs. So we have, to our engineer completion and our shale formation evaluation capabilities, as well as BroadBand Sequence, now established that growth technology offering. So in terms of how many wells, I would say there are thousands of wells in North America land that are candidates for refracturing and this is both shale liquids and shale gas. In terms of the market potential, I think you're talking billions, in terms of revenue opportunities, over an extended period of time. But this is quite a significant market opportunity. And I think the key here is that we're so confident in our ability to identify the right candidates and execute the refracturing work that we're prepared to take significant risks, in terms of how we go about doing this work. In many cases, if we can select the candidates, prepare to foot the entire bill for the refracturing work and then get paid back in production.
Bill Herbert: Okay and then second question is more of a macro question. Again referencing back to this presentation that you did a couple weeks ago -- the global drilling intensity slide, in which you juxtaposed the 2014 production numbers from the big three liquids producers, roughly the same, at about 11 million barrels per day. But significantly different levels of drilling activity to generate that output. 36,000 wells U.S., 8,700 for Russia and 399 for Saudi Arabia. And you also mentioned a host of markets that you didn't identify, but significantly lower than the U.S., with regard to drilling intensity. So you stated that basically, required level of drilling intensity for many of the Markets, to keep production flat. But the question that I have is not only to keep production flat, but the production -- the flexibility and the wherewithal to increase production with increased drilling intensity. Can you speak to that, please?
Paal Kibsgaard: What they're saying with that slide is that over time, basins mature. And in order to firstly maintain production and subsequently increase production which I think, in many of the land basins, we will be looking to do that in the coming years, you will have to increase drilling intensity. That's the basic message. So I think you're seeing that increase in drilling intensity happening in many basins around the world today. The drilling intensity is obviously generally far below what we're seeing today in North America land. But that's basically because, in most of the other basins, we're still working within the conventional resource base. And as you move from the conventional towards more unconventional, you will also generally see an increase in drilling intensity from that. But I would say, even in the conventional basin, there is a growing drilling intensity which we're now looking to capitalize on, both through the subsurface integration of the [indiscernible] assembly, as well as now going forward with our focusing on establishing our read on the future.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse Securities. Please go ahead.
Jim Wicklund: Relative to Bill's question, I guess, I find the most fascinating thing about the call today is, you're willing to propose a range of different business models, take some incremental technology risk and you talk about a new way of working together. So we're not just talking re-frack market in the U.S. You're sounding like a whole new business model of how service companies and oil companies will operate in the future? I don't mean to sound too Star Treky. But you're proposing something other than -- in the past, companies have been willing to take participation or risk at the bottom of a cycle. But you're talking about a structural change in the industry, it sounds like.
Paal Kibsgaard: I do, yes. And I think it's going to be very important, for the overall performance of the industry, that all the players that have something to contribute, not only to the implementation and execution part of the work we do. But also to how we design the solutions of what we're looking to build and develop, that they're all invited to the table. And I would say still remaining humble. I think we, from the Schlumberger side, we have a lot to contribute, when it comes to supporting the design decisions that many of our customers take for major drilling and completions developments.
Jim Wicklund: There is no question that you have more expertise than most any other oil company. But having worked for both oil companies and service companies, service company comes to me in the oil company and says, let me show you a better way to do stuff. The first reaction is, I got engineers that know how to do it. So this is pretty much a change in psychology, if you would or how the industry operates. You're talking about, this isn't a quick implementation, I would think, but over time?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, it's not a quick implementation and it's not something that we can do by ourselves. And currently, I think it's very clear. We're not saying that we can do the work our customers are doing better. But I think, given the capabilities that we have, I think we're underutilized today. And we have a lot more to contribute, even into the design elements of the work that is related to our expertise. And I think by being invited to the table to contribute, complementing what they are doing, I think we can achieve improvements in design and engineer costs out of the system, before we go to implementation. And by factoring in our implementation or execution capabilities in the design, I think we can also simplify and streamline the execution part of the work, as well. So this is something that we're going to offer, Jim. Some of our customers might take us up on it and some of the others might not and for the ones that are not, we will continue to work the way we're currently doing. But I think this is something that we believe can bring significant value and something that we're prepared to take on and also put some more skin in the game.
Operator: Thank you. David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Anderson: A related question what Jim was asking. I was wondering, more specifically, around offshore development and exploration. Obviously, with lower oil prices, it is a really challenging market right now. Some would even say the IOC business model is broken. It looks to us like maybe in a couple years, this could be in a slowdown here. So I'm just wondering, this is a pretty big part of your business. Schlumberger's oil -- the services part, in the scheme of things, is in a huge park. Can you just help us under -- give us a bit of a road map for how you think some of the IOCs are going to navigate to the deepwater and exploration? And how you see this progressing, in order to get this fixed?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think if you look at deepwater first, this represents a huge resource base for the industry. Now given the level of development cost today, as well as given the level of recovery factors we're seeing today, the cost per barrel for these type of developments is challenged. So there has to be a change in overall, in how these developments are done. We have to get the costs down and we also have to drive recovery up. And if you can do both, I think a large part of the reserve base and the discovery base that we have established over the past decade in deepwater, can and will be developed. So I think this is the challenge that the industry has and we're prepared to contribute towards finding the right solutions. And I think when the industry really puts their mind to something, we will find a solution and it will be sorted out. As to the [Technical Difficulty] separation, I think the play book we're seeing now is the normal one. Exploration is the first thing that can be cut which is not going to have a short-term and immediate impact on production. Looking at the current levels of exploration spend today, it is clearly unsustainable. I don't think it's going to get fixed or improved any time soon or at least not in 2015. But it is very clear that this level of exploration spend is not going to continue for many years.
David Anderson: Okay. And a separate topic on talking about the North America, you've talked about how the rig count won't go back to peak levels and I think we can all agree upon that. You talked a lot about the commentary around re-fracking opportunities. And clearly, you see that as a big opportunity, going forward. But what are some of the other structural trends that you think are influencing that view? What are the other components that, as you think about North America and I'm not sure if you can give us an idea of where you think that rig count can be a normalized rig count, if you will. But can you talk about some of the other factors, structurally, that are impacting that view?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think if you look at what's taken place over the past three or four years in shale liquids in North America, there has been a significant growth in activity and there has been a growing free cash flow deficit for the E&P industry. So that's clearly not a sustainable way of the whole industry to operate here. Now, with that said, I think there's a core part of the North America shale liquids that is viable, even at the current oil prices and this will continue to be developed. Now as we go forward, as the industry continues to improve. I would say, both on the cost side -- although a lot has already been done -- but even more so on the production per well. I think there can be a growing part of the -- I would say tier 2 and tier 3 acreage that can be developed. But as of now, I think we're limited more to the tier 1 acreage at these type of oil prices. And that's why we're saying that, given the cash flow constraints, we don't expect that rig counts are going to come back to the previous levels of around 2000. It's going to come back to somewhere in between the current levels and where it was. And for the service industry, that means that the pricing concessions that are currently being given, we unfortunately are going to have to live with for a while, because there's going to be a pretty significant order capacity for all sorts of services, given the lower activity level that we're going to recover to.
Operator: Next question is from Jim Crandell with Cowen Securities. Please go ahead.
Jim Crandell: My question has to do with the overall trend in international revenues and margins for here. If we look back at past cycles, often, the international business trends materially lag that of North America. I understand some things are different this time. But might we be looking at, generally, a deteriorating overall level of E&P spend? And maybe even Schlumberger revenue over the next 12 months?
Paal Kibsgaard: If you look at our view on total E&P spend globally, splitting it into North America and international, we're saying that the reduction in spending internationally is going to be significantly lower than what you see in North America. North America is going to be well above 30% and while we're saying around 15% for international. So I think the key, beyond what the spend reduction is -- and we're already seeing that spend reduction. And by the way, international spend was more or less flat already in 2014. I think the key from our side is the underestimated, I would say, resilience in our international business performance. If you look at how we've been managing to keep margins and also to continue to protect our overall earnings capacity in the international business, we're doing a pretty good job. And I think even with a 15% reduction in E&P spend, our revenues, year-over-year, was down 8% in the first quarter and our operating income was down 3%. So the key areas are our ability to continue to generate earnings, even in very challenging market conditions.
Jim Crandell: Do you think that the -- given your comments, have you seen your overall bottom in international revenues? Or do you think your overall international revenues will probably trend lower from the first quarter levels?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, at this stage, we see both North America and international revenue coming down further in Q2 [indiscernible]. But I would say more so in North America than in international.
Jim Crandell: And do you think that that will represent the bottom? Or do you think there could be further slippage in revenues, particularly internationally, in the second half of the year?
Paal Kibsgaard: I would say that the revenue reductions in Q2 are slowing in pace. I'm not ready to say that it's the bottom yet.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte: If I could follow up quickly on this re-frack opportunity. I'm curious as to what the suite of services are? And how they differ from a conventional primary frack job? I imagine it's a lot more analysis involved. Can you just walk us through what the work flow looks like? And the level of intellectual capital that's employed in the process?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, sure. So the overall work flow starts with us basically getting the well files and the well data from the operator. Our team of experts is then reviewing hundreds of candidate wells and we're taking the ones that we believe have the highest potential for increasing production after re-fracking treatment. So they're looking at the completion. They are looking at whatever formation evaluation data we have and then coming up with our candidate selection. Now in terms of the actual physical work execution at the well site, the first thing we need to do is to pull the pump out of the well and then prepare the well. But beyond that, it's just hooking up the fracturing treatment. And we basically pump a normal fracturing job, but with a BroadBand Sequence [indiscernible] space into the job. Generally then flooding off the existing perforations that have already been fracked, to be able to elevate the pressure in the well to fracture the additional perforations that initially weren't fracked when the well was first completed. So the key enablers here are the ability of our subsurface experts to identify the right well candidates. And in addition to that, the BroadBand Sequence, the technology, where we can actually divert fracturing fluid into the perforations that haven't properly been fractured in the first place.
Michael LaMotte: And is there any limitation, in terms of the initial completion, the hardware, the construction of that well? Any physical limitation?
Paal Kibsgaard: No.
Michael LaMotte: If I could ask a follow-up for Simon, real quick. Just on the working capital numbers. The receivable turns looked pretty good, but working capital use in the first quarter was still pretty high. Is that inventory? Can you delve into that a little bit, Simon?
Simon Ayat: Normally, we have seasonality to the working capital and the first quarter is a quarter where we consume working capital. And this year around, actually the receivable was a positive. Inventory stayed flattish, but the biggest consumption was on the accounts payable and employee payable. The first quarter, we basically meet all of the requirements of the incentives, the bonuses of the previous year. And as we highlighted, we also had the payment associated with the restructuring of $245 million. So the main impact on the working capital came from the other elements that I highlighted. So over $1 billion, by the way, Michael.
Michael LaMotte: Yes, that $245 million was in that, then, as well?
Simon Ayat: The $245 million was a restructuring cost, with Venezuela, obviously, it's not the cash element. The biggest issue is, as I mentioned, accounts payable and employee payable was more than $1 billion of deterioration.
Michael LaMotte: And then Simon, Paal mentioned 75% plus free cash flow conversion as a target. The Free Cash Flow deployment in the repurchase program was also impressively high. Is there a target there that we can apply, going forward?
Simon Ayat: So as we always said, Michael, the number or the amount that we will spend on the buyback is always a balancing number. Our priority is to invest in the business, whether it's CapEx or future revenue stream, SPM, multi-client. And then the dividend, obviously, we will continue to meet our commitment and revise it every year. And the balancing period will always be the buyback. And during the downturn, the conversion rate, you know, is always helping.
Michael LaMotte: Higher, yes.
Simon Ayat: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: It's great to see when everything -- the whole plan comes into fruition and everything you outlined last year at your June energy investor day, so congrats on that performance.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Kurt Hallead: You're welcome. The follow-up question that I've been having and we had an opportunity to canvas a number of different investors last night and it still seems the primary question on everybody's mind, from this point forward, is how sustainable is this relative performance on decrementals? I think you addressed it broadly in your commentary, about the execution and transformation and so on. And I think the million-dollar question out there is, are the decremental margins going to moderate into the second quarter and then second half of the year, from where they are in the first quarter? And in conjunction with that, how much of this decremental margin performance has really been, say "one-off"? Or how much of this decremental performance is truly structural in nature?
Paal Kibsgaard: If we focus in our discussion on decrementals around international business, right, where our decrementals sequentially, in Q1, was 25%, I think this performance is -- first of all, nothing one-off in that performance. And secondly, that performance is not just one quarter, either. I think the overall resilience in our well-balanced international business is largely underestimated. Actually, if you look at the performance going back to 2012, we posted 35% incrementals in 2012, 42% in 2013 and 69% in 2014. So the fact that we have a very good handle of running the international business, in an environment where we've been facing growing headwinds throughout this period, both in exploration, in deepwater and seismic. And also with significant IOC spend costs, even starting in 2014, I think these incrementals clearly show that the decrementals we're posting in Q1 is just a continuation of a multi-year run of improving business performance.
Kurt Hallead: Now the follow-up I would have is, you talk about -- you outlined a view that the U.S. recovery will not match prior activity levels in a period of pricing pressure could be upon us for a period of time. Now in the context, the re-frack -- and I'm just trying to connect the dots. Because if there's a significant amount of re-frack that's going to happen, I would have personally thought that that would lead to a more rapid capacity absorption period and potentially a faster recovery period, in terms of pricing because everyone is going to get all this backlog of re-frack. So can you just -- I might be a little bit slow. Can you help me connect the dots on how re-fracking won't lead to an acceleration in capacity absorption? And get your thoughts on that would be great.
Paal Kibsgaard: I think for the re-frack, this work scope, I think, is going to be limited to the companies that can do the two things that I stated earlier. Firstly, help the customers identify the right candidate. And secondly, have technologies that make the cost base of the refracturing feasible and economical. And based on the work we've done, in terms of identifying candidates during trials, re-fracks for a range of customers already, the economics, based on the BroadBand Sequence technology, is actually quite attractive in between re-fracking an old well or drilling a new well. So I think it would be limited to the companies that have that capability. Now even if there were a range of companies that could do it, I still think that this market overall, in terms of absorbing capacity, isn't going to fix the problem. So if you look at the overall activity that we had last year, where we had about 2000 rigs operating, we're down now below 1000. If you take a pick anywhere in between the two numbers of where the recovery is going to come back, no matter what number you pick I think it's very clear that it's going to be significant over-capacity in the market. And that means that pricing that is now already at very low levels is not going to improve in that situation. So re-frack is an opportunity for the companies that have the right technology to it. I don't think it's going to have a big enough impact to fix the overall capacity issue in North America land. But it will be, I think, a very good avenue of growth for the companies that can identify the right candidates and also have the technology to effectively re-frack, while keeping costs low enough to make it economical.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Daniel Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Daniel Boyd: So Paal, you'll typically gain market share in a downturn and you're looking for E&P spend internationally down 15%. So should we take that and suggest that Schlumberger is going -- to revenues will decline something less than 15% this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think we have some good opportunities this year to gain market share. We talked about that in the January call. I think the -- this whole discussion around what we perceive to be the glass ceiling in the international market will potentially open up more market share opportunities for us. I think also, given the fact that we're able to run a very good and very effective business internationally, would also allow us opportunities to leverage that capability to further gain market share as well. So we're not going to be obsessed about market share, other than, we're going to look for the opportunities. And we want to continue to navigate the commercial landscape by balancing both market share with continuous margin performance.
Daniel Boyd: So that's what I would expect, too. And then if you do the algebra, it implies sequential growth internationally in the back half of this year. But my question really comes down to international margins, because last cycle, we saw international margins bleed lower, even as revenues started increasing. What's your thought process? Or how do you think this cycle plays out? Are we in a different position, whereas revenue increases, we could actually have slightly higher margins? Or is the pricing -- negative pricing impact going to bleed through again?
Paal Kibsgaard: We're already seeing challenges, both in activity and pricing and it's not the market. Obviously, with these significant spend reductions that's always going to be there. I think the difference we're seeing, at this stage, is that based on these incrementals that I referenced just in the previous question, our ability to continuously drive performance, to how we execute internationally and leveraging the scale we have of operations. And also have a steady contribution from the transformation that is what is allowing us to hold margins up the way they are. We have significantly outperformed our competitors in margins over the previous two or three years and this has just got nothing to do with pricing. Every bid on lowest price for basic technologies in any country around the world, the only thing that differentiates us from the competition is that we're able to translate this revenue into higher margins, basically based on how we run the company. So we're always winning any bid on the lowest price. And we have to be commercially competitive. But the key here is the internal [indiscernible] of the company and how we run and execute. And I think that ability has improved significantly over the past three or four years. And that's why we hope that we should be able to manage both decrementals and overall margins better, this time around, in the international market, than what we've done in previous cycles.
Daniel Boyd: So in other words as revenue increases you hope to, at a minimum maintain your margin level, at that point?
Paal Kibsgaard: We're continuing to try to do better than what we did in previous cycles, yes.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of James West with Evercore. Please go ahead.
James West: I was wanting to ask about BroadBand Sequence and I spent a lot of time with your technology guys last month in Houston. How much of that business now is a push model, being you going to your clients and talking to them about the attributes of that versus a pull model, where the clients are actually coming to you saying, we need this technology?
Paal Kibsgaard: I still think there is a mixture that any new technology in North America land, the uptake takes some time. But what we did differently this time around, with broadband in general versus what we did with HiWAY, is that in the third quarter last year, myself and a few of my chiefs, we went around to a range of North American E&P companies and presented the concept of this technology, and also offered them trial runs to try this out. And that's why the general uptake of BroadBand Sequence has been significantly faster than what HiWAY was which was always, actually, quite good, as well, in 2011. But the rate of uptake of BroadBand Sequence has been significantly higher than what HiWAY was.
James West: Okay, got it. And then just an unrelated follow-up, we think about the international markets and I know you touched a lot on the U.S. market and production there. But internationally, that's a pretty heavy decline rates, as well, a lack of investment international markets. What do you see as the potential for a significant drop in supply from the international side? And on that topic, is it possible not to be bullish on at least brent prices, going forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think you're right. We believe that there is a weakness in the non-NAM, non-OPEC supply base. It was basically flat Q1, year-over-year. But given the reductions we're seeing in spend and the weakness in several of the key basins, we expect that weakness to continue and potentially increase, as the year progresses and I think that's why we believe that there will be some recovery in Brent. The question is, to what extent OPEC wants or is willing, to put more barrels on the market to stabilize prices at some level below $100.
Operator: Thank you. We'll turn it back to our speakers.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you. So before we close, I would like to thank all of you for participating in today's call. As your questions have indicated, you're all concerned that this market is quite challenging at the moment. I think it's useful to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the past quarter has been challenging to manage. But by being able to quickly adjust plans and by continuing to focus on what we control, we have delivered significantly better decremental margins, compared to previous cycles. And our international leverage and the acceleration of our transformation program, are together creating a strong platform for financial out-performance, also, going forward. Second, we believe that the industry needs to think differently, in order to reduce project costs and increase project value. And we see closer collaboration between operators and the large service companies as a key element in achieving this goal. And this closer collaboration should also include more performance-based contracting models which we're fully prepared to enter into. And last, while we continue to actively manage cost and resources throughout this downturn, by streamlining overhead structures and reducing field capacity, we can quickly add back capacity when opportunities arise to take on more work. Through the efficiency gains created by our transformation program and through our unmatched recruiting and training machine which is fully intact. That concludes the call for today. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Thank you, Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full quarter 2014 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information is included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your comments after the prepared segments. I will now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $1.50. This represents an increase of $0.01 sequentially and is $0.15 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter we recorded $1.8 billion of pretax charges. These charges are primarily related to actions we have taken to meet the challenges of the current market conditions. The $806 million of charges relating to the restructuring of the WesternGeco seismic fleet are as we announced last month. We recorded $296 million of severance cost associated with the headcount reduction of approximately 9,000. This reduction which will largely be completed by the end of the first quarter will bring our headcount more in line with the currently anticipated activity levels. In Venezuela effective December 31, 2014, we changed the exchange rate we applied to our bolivar denominated transactions from 6.3 to 50 bolivar per dollar, which is in line with the SICAD II exchange rate resulting in a $472 million charge. We believe that this rate now best represents the economics of our business activity in Venezuela. Going forward, this charge will reduce the US dollar amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses. Had we applied this exchange rate throughout all of 2014, it would have reduced our full year EPS by approximately $0.08. The last item relates to $199 million write-down of unconventional integrated project in the Eagle Ford as the result of the decline in oil prices. Fourth quarter revenue of $12.6 billion was flat sequentially. This reflected approximately $260 million of yearend software product and multi-client sales which were weaker than what we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. Pretax operating income of $2.8 billion decreased 1% sequentially while the pretax operating margins decreased by just 19 basis points to 22%. This level of margin is consistent with the same period last year. Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins increased by 95 basis points to 30.9%. The revenue decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal drop in marine seismic activity while wireline experienced declines in Russia due to the seasonality and the weakening of the ruble. These decreases were partially offset by yearend multi-client and software sales. The margin increase reflected a more favorable revenue mix as a result of the yearend sales.  Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.7 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined by 94 basis points to 20.7%. These decreases were primarily driven by unfavorable currency effects and activities declines in Russia that impacted the drilling and measurement and M-I SWACO as well as lower IPM activity in Mexico. Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of just under $5 billion increased 5% sequentially on higher well services activity in both Western Canada and US land. Year end sales of Completions and Artificial Lift Products also contributed to the increase. Pretax margins were essentially flat at 18.3%. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 21.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.1% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion representing an improvement of $458 million as compared to the end of Q3. We spent $1.1 billion on our stock buyback program during Q4. This represented 12.1 million shares at an average price of $90.22. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of almost $1 billion. From a cash flow perspective we generated $11.2 billion of cash flow from operations during all of 2014. During this same period we generated a free cash flow of $6.2 billion. This represents $700 million increase over 2013 and means that we converted 84% of our 2014 earnings excluding charges and credits into free cash flow. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities which we did by completing various acquisitions and investing $4 billion in CapEx, $1.1 billion in multiclients and SPM projects while at the same time returning $6.6 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. During the full year 2014, we repurchased 47.5 million shares at an average price of $98.38 for a total of $4.7 billion while paying out almost $2 billion in dividends. Yesterday our board of directors approved a 25% increase in our annual dividend to $2 per share. This is now the fifth consecutive year that we have increased our dividend and it results in doubling over the five-year period. This new level of dividend reflects our confidence and our ability to continue to generate superior cash flows and return excess cash to our shareholders even in the face of market challenges. As it relates to 2015, our strong balance sheet will continue -- will also allow us to be opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of market conditions to make strategic acquisitions and investment. CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM investment is expected to be approximately $3 billion in 2015. We expect the ETR for the full year 2015 to be in the low to mid 20s. However this can rally on a quarterly basis depending on the geographical mix of earnings. And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter we continued our strong financial performance driven by record activity in North America and in the Middle East and Asia. In other international areas, Latin America revenues improved slightly on higher activity in Venezuela and Columbia while Europe, CIS and Africa fell as the ruble weakened and the seasonal decline activity started in Russia. Europe, CIS and Africa declined further from the downward trend in oil prices which curtailed customer activity and reduced rig count in the North Sea and parts of West Africa. Overall fourth quarter revenue was flat with the previous quarter but grew 6% year-on-year. Pretax operating income decreased 1% sequentially and grew 7% year-on-year while pretax operating margins were essentially flat slipping 19 basis points sequentially but rising 13 basis points year-on-year. This performance ended the year in which Schlumberger revenue climbed to a new high in spite of significant head winds including activity challenges in a number of geo markets, geopolitical unrest in Libya and Iraq, international sanctions in Russia and reducing customer spend. Still our global footprint, broad business portfolio, and strong execution capabilities provided the required resilience to outperform even in this environment. Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter bringing the full year total to more than $6.2 billion. This represents an increase of 13% over 2013 and a conversion of 84% of the full year's earnings into free cash flow. During the quarter we continued our active stock buyback program buying back $1.1 billion in stock to keep us on track to complete the $10 billion program within the stated two and a half year period.  As a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our continuing ability to generate free cash flow, the board of directors just approved that 25 increase in our quarterly dividend which means that we have doubled our dividend payment over the past five years. By geography, our North American results set the new record for the area as revenue grew 2% sequentially. Line activity improved in spite of tough sequential recount as new technology introductions and operational efficiencies drove performance. ___ drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico returned to normal, and grew by 12% sequentially following the impact of loop currents in the third quarter. While multiclient seismic sales also improved although ending up significantly down compared to the same quarter last year. Sequential revenue gains were led by the production group on higher pressure pumping activity on land in both the US and Canada and further supported by very strong uptake of the BroadBand family of stimulation technologies that are growing at four times the rate of highway at the same stage of it's introduction. North America margins increased by a further 24 basis points in Q4 to reach 19.6% driven by stronger activity and new technology uptake, solid execution and further supply chain cost improvements. Lower oil prices have already created pricing pressure on land for hydraulic fracturing and drilling services and we are actively working with our customers in all basins to help lower their overall drilling and completion costs. In addition to general typing discussions, our customer interactions are focused on how we can better work together and how we can create savings from new technologies and workflows as well as from improved operational planning and efficiency. Looking forward in North America we see a relatively flat first quarter for offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico as well as solid activity in Canada. However the dramatic fallen oil prices has already led to a reduction of around 400 rigs in US land compared to the October peak and we expect the trend of activity reductions and pricing pressure to continue in the first quarter. In our international business, strength in the Middle East and Asia and solid performance in Latin America was offset by significant revenue reductions in Europe, CIS and Africa. As a result, revenue slipped 1% sequentially but improved 1% year-on-year while pretax operating income decreased 2% sequentially but grew 4% year-on-year. Full year performance in the international market was strong in spite of E&P CapEx spend remaining flat with 2013. Year-on-year revenue grew by 4%, operating income by 12% with incremental margins of 69%.  International margins which ended the year at 24% grew 168 basis points versus 2013 and we generated more than 70% of our global operating income in the international market in the past year. The significant drop in oil prices have put pressure on our customers to further reduce their cost of barrel and we are actively engaged with most of them to find ways to generate their required cost savings while maintaining a very strong focus on the quality and integrity on the products and services we provide. Within the international areas, performance was led by the Middle East and Asia where sequential revenue grew by 4% and pretax operating margins increased by 71 basis points to 28.3% driven by activity growth in the Middle East while activity in Asia was largely unchanged. Year-on-year revenue increased 6% and margins grew by 2013 basis points. In the Middle East region, activity reached a new record in Saudi Arabia led by growth from a number of key projects and we expect to see continued strong levels of both rig-related and rig-less activity in the coming years. Kuwait was also strong on land seismic activity and yearend product and software sales while Oman continued to be driven by wireline services and hydraulic fracturing work. Activity was again higher in the United Arab Emirates particularly for well construction technologies both offshore and on the island drilling project. In Iraq, activity was steady in the north as an improved security environment had allowed operations to slowly resume. However the overall activity level still remained significantly below pre-conflict levels. In the south, we saw modest activity improvements although new project start-ups continued to be delayed. Southeast Asia remained flat through the third quarter as strength in shale gas development on land in china offset modest activity declines in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. China was also boosted by increased product sales during the fourth quarter and strong offshore activity in Bohai Bay. In Malaysia, work has begun in the new well construction project on the Bokor field where we have now been conducting integrated project and production management operations for more than 10 years. This is another example of the value that long-term relationships bring to integrated operations. In Latin America, revenue improved 1% sequentially while pretax operating margins fell 102 basis points to 20.9% as growth in Columbia and Venezuela was offset by weakness in Mexico and delayed in Argentina and Brazil. Year-on-year revenue grew by 3% while pretax operating margin slipped by 31 basis points. In Venezuela growth was driven by new technology and work flow deployment for PDVSA as well as increased activity in the far half through a series on new project startups. In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget constraints and seasonal weather effect impacting offshore activity. The lower customer spent mainly impacted land development activity although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in the area activity in Brazil was solid on land but offshore work was lower and IOC projects were completed and drilling delays were experienced on existing project. In Argentina growth slowed in the fourth quarter although activity from conventional resources grew and the highway technology continuing to penetrate the market. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue fell by 7% sequentially with margin declining by 112 basis points to 22.3%. Compared to the same quarter last year, Europe, CIS and Africa revenue fell by 5% while margin slipped by 21 basis points. In Russia, weakness in the ruble and the onset of winter weather led to the lower result. The North Sea activity also declined on lower rig count in both Norway and the UK as customers reduced activity in response to lower oil prices. In other parts of Europe, Africa and CIS area, activity was stronger in North Africa with increasing activity for unconventional resources in Algeria and Tunisia. This was partially offset by very weak activity in Libya where we now have successfully restructured our operations in line with the lower activity. In Angola, activity decreased following the peak in explorations seen in the third quarter while elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa activity was strong in Congo and we also secured additional growth in Chad and Gabon. Before leaving the Europe, CIS and Africa area, I would also like to mention that we were awarded a full-year contract for drilling and well services by Statoil for the UK Mariner development east of Shetland. Mariner is one of the largest project development on the UK continental shelf in the last 10 years and their 22 distinct services that Schlumberger will provide offer considerable opportunities for integration in this unique project. In terms of the outlook for the international market, as part of the Middle East and partial Latin America, we do expect a reduction in spend levels for all customer groups in the coming year although we believe that the activity and pricing impact will be less than what is projected in North America land. It is also worthwhile to keep in mind that E&P spend in the international market was already flat in 2014 with a corresponding drop in discovered reserves and in oil production capacity. So a further reduction in spend levels in 2015 will likely accelerate these trends. Turning to the overall macro outlook for 2015, GDP growth rate softened somewhat in the fourth quarter but that 3% growth is still projected to be higher than 2014 confirming that the global recovery remains intact and as a result, demand for oil is again expected to increase by around 1 million barrels per day in 2016. Looking at the supply side, the growth in global oil production capacity of around 1 million barrels per day over the past year matches the growth in demand. So the overall oil market is still relatively well balanced from a capacity standpoint. The dramatic fall in oil prices is instead a result of higher marketed supply in the second half of 2014 from North America and also from OPEC who have shifted focus from protecting oil prices to protecting oil prices to protecting market share. In response to the falling oil prices, the industry is currently in the process of significantly reducing E&P investments which will lead to a reduction in supply as declining rates impact current production capacity and lower exploration and development activity delay supply additions. In a scenario of continuing economic growth and increasing demand for oil, the lower E&P investment levels will lead to a tightening of the oil market with the first indication being the reduced production capacity in the international markets in 2014 following a year of flat E&P investment. In this uncertain environment, we continue to focus on what we can control and we have already taken significant steps to restructure and right size our business to match the reduced E&P investment level. We are further convinced that performance must now be driven by and accelerated change in the way we work through our transformation program. The delivery of new technology that improves the performance of our customer's reservoirs, the increases in efficiency and reliability that reduced overall timing, development and production costs and the opportunities for growth and greater integration bring are all significant drivers of our own and our customers' performance. The technical performance targets of our transformation program is independent of the macro environment and we are in 2015 actually looking to further accelerate the implementation of the program. In terms of technology, we still expect new technology sales at premium pricing to contribute more than 25% of our revenue while we also target integration related activity where we had unique capabilities to exceed 30% of our total activity. In terms of reliability and efficiency we are in 2015 aiming to make further progress towards our targets of a 10-fold reduction in non-productive time and doubling in asset utilization at 20% increase in workforce productivity and 10% lowering of support costs which will all help to significantly lower our operating costs. Part of our transformation program requires us to work differently with our customers in order to fully realize the value for both them and for us. Given the current business environment, we have engaged with many of them in recent months to drive forward these changes with very positive response. Still given the level of the oil price and the industry wide focus on reducing E&P investments, we clearly have a challenging year in front of us. In this environment we have our entire organization fully focused on continuously engage in our customers to understand any changes to their plan, retailer resources through activity in line with the targets and playbooks we have established and to manage commercial discussions according to the priorities we have put in place for each of the over 80 countries where we operate. Beyond our strong execution focus, we also see the coming year as flushed with opportunities for us which we intend to fully capitalize on as we look to further strengthen the company going forward. With our wide geographical footprint, extensive business portfolio, and clear financial strength, we remain confident in our ability to outperform in any part of the cycle including the current market condition. Thank you. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer: Yes, thanks a lot and thanks for your insights there Paal. I wondered whether you could start with the macro here. I wondered whether you could help us understand your slight change in language from the third quarter. You highlighted both in the third quarter release and the fourth quarter release that negativity, the peer revisions, I mean, that's consistent. But on the supply side you talked in the third quarter about pipe capacity and now you are talking about increase in supply. I just wondered whether you could just elaborate a little bit and help us understand the difference in the magnitude.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So if you look at the high level macro view that we have, nothing has really changed from what we said on the Q3 call. So looking at GDP at 3% we are still looking at solid growth overall in 2015 and oil demand is also going to be up. So as we said in Q3 the issue is really on the supply side where I think it's very important that we separate the three in global production capacity and marketed supply. So if you look at the global production capacity in 2014, it grew by about 1 million barrels a day which is equal to the growth in demand. So the significant drop in oil prices is not driven by this over capacity but rather by the higher marketed supply which is coming from North America and from OPEC. So we believe that the supply side is currently going through a significant change where the key local producers have shifted focus from protecting price to now protect market share, and the consequence of this is that at least for a period of time, this is going to make the high cost producers become the new swing producers where the activity is going to be even more driven by the variations in oil price and the economics of their project. And the tool used to drive this change to the supply side is the lower oil price which is what we are seeing now. So the main new element from the Q3 call is that OPEC decided not to cut production so the reduction in the marketed supply will have to come from lower E&P investments and that is really the only offtake to our macro view.
Ole Slorer: And my second follow up would be exactly on that. You highlight this time around in your release that the two effect of lower CapEx increased declined curves from existing fields and delays in new field start-ups. So I wonder whether you could talk a little bit at a high level at what point do you see the impact of this will change market psychology on the direction of incremental capacity versus a direction of incremental demand assuming demand plays out in line with your view there.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, if we assume that oil demand is going to be up by 1 million barrels, if we don't take lower investments and already reduce their capacity, the market is already heading towards a tightening. I think that's very clear. Now we don't expect the oil prices to improve significantly until there are signs of weakening supply, and the weakening supply will either first come from North America or from international. I think the signs we need to look at are different from the two regions. Given the strong growth momentum in North America I think what the market will be looking for here is the slowing year-over-year growth while given the flat investment levels in international market in 2014, capacity already reduced in 2014. So here I think we are looking for a further reduction in absolute supply. So I think these are the two main signals to look for.
Ole Slorer: And then your guess again on timing?
Paal Kibsgaard: I am not going to guess at least not in public.
Ole Slorer: Okay, Paal, I will hand it back. Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Good morning Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
David Anderson: I was just wondering, in light on your commentary around the supply response and you are talking about international and North America, there is clearly a pretty healthy debate out there about the economics of North America in unconventional. Just wondering with Schlumberger's expertise in reservoir, can you help us understand how you think about that marginal cost supplier and in particular how you see the trajectory of spending and activity levels in North America over the next several quarters?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I think if you look at 2015 activity in North America and you look at the third party spend surveys, it indicates about 25%, 30% reduction. So it's clearly going to be a tough year going forward, right. As to the viability of the project I think there is still a broad range of operating costs in North America land. But I would say that as a general statement the shift in OPEC from protecting price to protecting share is raising some questions around the US shale going forward and I think the new oil price dynamic is clearly going to test the resilience of several North America land producers from their ability to get financing, their ability to continue to drive cost efficiency and reduced cost of barrel and also their ability to maintain production at current level. So I think most likely we are going to face the situation in North America land with lower activity, more focus on the lower cost production areas for a while. That's our view at this stage.
David Anderson: And then just kind of sticking still on North America in light of the headcount and CapEx reduction and keeping in mind that you are getting more capital efficient of the transformation. I just wonder if you could help us understand your strategy during this downturn to align your capacity with activity levels. Should we expect a similar strategy that Schlumberger employed in 2009 or can we expect it to be a little bit more focused on utilization this time around?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I am not going to go into the detail tactics and strategy we have on pricing and share. That's going to vary all depending on I would say the basin, the customer type and so forth. But I will say that the general rule that we have applied in recent years that below a certain contribution margin, we will rather stack the equipment than operate at the level that is unacceptable.
David Anderson: Okay, thank you Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Thank you, good morning. Paal, so switching gears here a sec from North America to the international realm and recognizing that the early data internationally has not been as transparent as it has in North America given the litany of capital spending analysis for '15. But given where oil prices are today, certainly it seems that the indication points to a pretty hard landing in the international realm and while we share your view that the contraction internationally is going to be more benign than in North America, it's still going to be fairly consequential. So just as a starting point, is down 10% to 15% internationally within the realm of reason where we sit today?
Paal Kibsgaard: While to think to kind of venture out and even make full year statement at this stage I think it's too early. We have very significant lack of visibility. The way we are going about managing actually both North America and internationally, is we are looking quarter by quarter now. So we have taken actions to be in line with costs versus the activity that we foresee for Q1. And we will continue to stay very closely in touch with customers to look at plans going forward to make sure that we continue to tailor resources to the projected activity. Now we are aware of the third party surveys and the 10% to 15% reduction in international spend for 2015 I think today is probably a reasonable starting point although I wouldn't confirm it from our side for the full year.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And then secondly kind of juxtaposing downturn as it were 2015 versus what prevailed in 2009, I mean clearly you are a different company coming into this downturn than you were in 2009 given the internal transformation focus. In light of that, do you think the decremental margins this time around are going to be better behaved anywhere in 2009 or basically about in line?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I would be very disappointed if we don't see a significant improvement in our decremental margins in this downturn versus what we saw in 2009. The -- we've had a very, very strong focus on generating incremental margins in the past four, five years, and over the past quarter we have basically converted our strong and peer expectations on incremental into equally clear expectations internally on what good decrementals are. I am not going to give you what the number is but like I said I will be very disappointed if we don't do significantly better than in 2009.
Bill Herbert: Very good, thank you sir.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte: Thanks. Good morning Paal. I am trying to hone in on how you're actually approaching 2015 and maybe take it from the perspective of the methods to the leadership of Schlumberger in terms of controlled business. You mentioned several things you can control, maintain the targets on the transformation program with the lack of visibility, maybe tighten up the reaction time from six months reviews to quarter-by-quarter. Is there anything else that we should be thinking about in terms of approaching the downturn of '15?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I think you hit on several of the things. But if I was to just kind of repeat to clarify them, what we have passed to our senior management team in the quite frequent meetings we've had over the past quarter, there are really three high level things. Firstly, the increased importance of staying very, very close to our customers. First interactively support our efforts to reduce their cost levels but also to make sure that the -- we very clearly understand their plans and changes to their plans. That's the first one. The second one is what you will alluded to do that we stay focused on what we control. And that is to proactively adjust costs to activity levels, and factoring in the benefits from the transformation. And also having a clear plan on how we are going to navigate the commercial landscape in terms of activity and pricing discussions with our customers but also very importantly to continue to focus and deliver safe and high quality operations, which is essential to our performance but also to our customer's performance. And the third one which we are also balancing into the total picture is to capture the opportunities that we see in the current environment and we see the current environment as being flushed with opportunities for us. First is to gain market share in light of our two main competitors looking to combine. Secondly to accelerate the transformation, our organization is now pulling very hard on it and we also see our customers being very open to adjust how we work with them and how we interact with them to gain some of the benefits. And then the third one is inorganic growth. We see lots of opportunities for this based on our strong cash flow and also very solid balance sheet. So these are the high level messages that we have already passed to our management team and they are currently executing.
Michael LaMotte: That's very helpful. Thank you. If I can follow-up on your inorganic growth comment quickly, does the current environment change the process around acquisitions and the last few years they've been smaller, bolt-on has been used as a term to describe the strategy since Smith. Does the appetite for a larger deal change in this environment?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I wouldn't see that. The current environment has changed the strategic directions that we were looking to pursue. It is more about when these opportunities arise. We have a clear view of where the company is heading and what we want to do from an M&A standpoint. We have been executing a number of these things in pervious years and as we go forward now, we would look at whether the other opportunities that we have in our list become accelerated opportunities in which case we will pursue them.
Michael LaMotte: Okay, thanks so much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Morning.
Angie Sedita: Paal, so could you talk a little bit, I mean you have the 25% reduction in your CapEx and could you give us a little bit of high level color on that cut where the cuts are coming from and I recall that in 2009, you did reduce your CapEx tied to technology but based on your opening remarks, it sounds that that would not be case to cycle and then also how flexible are you on your CapEx outlook for 2015?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. Well like you say in the current full year CapEx estimate is 3 billion, but given the lack of visibility and the uncertainty, this is still subject to change. So I will also that part of the CapEx reduction is due to the efficiency gains that we are planning from the transformation. So you cannot directly translate the CapEx to a projected revenue for 2015 and I also don't think you can directly compare it to the CapEx reductions that we did in 2009. I will also say that we have significant flexibility built into our manufacturing capabilities. We are, as I mentioned, targeting market share gains in particular in the international market. So if we need more CapEx, to serve these gains, we have the flexibility to increase CapEx during the year, and also we have the opportunity and flexibility to decrease CapEx further if the impact on the transformation is even beyond what we are targeting. 
Angie Sedita: All right. And then kind of an unrelated follow-up, I mean obviously your customers are coming to you and the international markets talking and looking at the contracts and where you can pull out cost out of the system, and you are seeing it in the US, how much success or have you begun conversations and where you can pull cost out of the system specifically in US frac. Is there other cost recovery opportunities besides proppants, truck, rail and what are you seeing along those lines?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well overall or in the US?
Angie Sedita: Both, actually.
Paal Kibsgaard: While I would -- our approach to these discussions with our customers and we are receiving invitations to engage in these discussions both international and in North America. I mean our approach is that we fully understand the need our customers have to reduce their overall costs. And we have engaged in a range of discussions where we are looking at volume discounts versus market share, further application and new technology, generally better planning and efficiency maybe less use of backup resources, better terms and conditions and it also involves general pricing discussions, right. So with the transformation, we have significant opportunity to drive costs of our system internally but some of these cost savings will also depend on our customers being open to work with us in different ways. And I would say there is a significant increase in that openness to start to realize these values and I think our discussions in general are focused on how we can create more value together, obviously in addition to general pricing discussions.
Angie Sedita: All right. And so -- I guess to add on to that, are you going back to your supply chain vendors for changes in cost reductions and proppants and other sources that you have in the US or internationally and are you able to pull cost out of your system besides the efficiency side?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, absolutely. And over the past three years or so, we have fully centralized our shared services and supply chain organization including global category management. So we are fully leveraging firstly our buying power and secondly I would say a highly capable supply chain organization to drive a similar type of discussion with our suppliers as to the discussions we have with our customers.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. I will turn it over.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
James West: I wanted to just touch on the transformation program again and kind of clarify a few things there. Obviously you are looking to speed up the transformation. I wanted to know if you could give us some sense of kind of how much more quickly you can go through this? And then secondarily, does the downturn, which I know we all don't like, nobody likes downturns, but does that not make the transformation easier to be in a downturn?
Paal Kibsgaard: In some ways it does. Because then you are performing quite well and you are busy taking on more work and growing to change to where you were both internally and in the interfaces, you have both the customers and suppliers. It's more difficult to drive change in that type of situation. When you have a shift in market conditions as you have now, we see even more interest internally and even more openness on the customer supply side to engage in doing things differently. So I would say, yes, the changing market condition provides us with more opportunity to accelerate so then the key is just how do we put resources on to this from a central management standpoint to have the various parts of the program staff and given the financial means to accelerate some of the investments that we are making to realize these gains.
James West: Okay. Great. And then I have a follow-up not on that but unrelated. You made a comment earlier about going after market share as a result of your two major competitors combining. Have you already seen customers come to you and have you already seen market share gains? I know it is early days but is it already happening?
Paal Kibsgaard: No I think it's a bit premature to say it's happening now. I mean the transaction is not closed yet. So I think as of now we are preparing for this. In discussions with our customers, the topic comes up, but I would say that this is more something that will take place if and when the transaction is closed.
James West: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Kurt Hallead: Just follow-up on James's question on the potential fallout from the merger. As you indicated there is nothing yet shaking loose necessarily and that will come post deal close. So you've indicated or you've emphasized at least in your prior commentary market share gains and with an emphasis on the international side. So I was wondering if you might be able to just give us a little bit of color on what you think may shake loose and how many basis points of market share gains could come out of this if not for Schlumberger specific, maybe on a broader basis?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well if I was going to comment on the transaction firstly at the high level, I would say that the pending transaction first validates what we have been saying all along and that is that scale is essential to drive performance in the business that we are in. Now from our experience making a making a large transaction to build and leverage scale it has a series of challenges. And in general everything takes much longer than you initially think. And in addition to this, all the extra work that is involved with making such a transaction, easily distracts you from running the base business. So as I have been saying we look at this transaction as an opportunity within capital low for us and we do intend to capitalize on it, and this is again linked to the gaining of market share. In the international market I would say in many countries our market share has been limited by a glass ceiling and this glass ceiling has been put in place by our customers to make sure that there is enough work to make a third player viable. Now if the other two players were to combine into one, then I think this glass ceiling can easily be broken and that's why we are basically going through pretty much all our contracts in all the international countries we operate in and to make sure we have targeted plans for how we would look to capitalize on this market share opportunity if and when the transaction closes.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That's good. And so many topics and so little time, so just wanted to try to calibrate some things with you. You said you guys reduced headcount by 9,000 to address current activity levels, then you reference a couple of third-party E&P surveys with the US down 25% to 30% which seems low in my view and 10% to 15%, which if I were to interpret your commentary though you didn't state specifically might suggest is you think that 10% to 15% reduction in international spend is too low, or too much? 
Paal Kibsgaard: While as I said I didn't make a full year statement on this. We are going to focus on managing this year in quarters. I think the general statements I would make is that the impact on North America Land we expect to be significantly more dramatic then what you would see in the rest of the world.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. And then if I just may finish with one. Just curious about your views on what's going on with the market opportunities in Brazil given all the corruption, scandals and so on and so forth. And maybe tying that back to the merger coming up here, which would give your competitor about 70% market share, if I'm not mistaken, of the recently awarded drilling package. So first and foremost, with the mess in Brazil, is that going to lead to activity declines you think in 2015? And then secondarily, how do you see the possibility of this drilling contract being re-bid one more time?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I think as to your -- the things going on but in Petrobras I will let Petrobras comment on those things. Our relationship with Petrobras and our working relationship continues to be very good. Now Petrobras did recently announce budget cuts for their first half of 2015 and versus a previously indication of flat spend. So there will be challenges in Brazil going into this year. As for the new contracts, the latest information we have is that the wireline and E&M contract will kick in mid-year of 2015. And what is going to happen to the market share within these contracts and I don't know. We are based on the bid happy with the contact. Now what Petrobras chooses to do in terms of market allocations we will have to revert to them.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
Bill Sanchez: Thanks, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Bill Sanchez: Paal, given your quarter-to-quarter kind of look here how you are managing the business I was hoping perhaps you could help us just calibrate 1Q relative to fourth quarter? I know we didn't see quite probably the yearend product sales one would expect. You talked in your prepared comments just kind of some of the puts and takes in North America but I didn't hear much specifically around international. And just trying to see if you can help us calibrate how we should think about 4Q to 1Q here from an EPS perspective?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay, if you look at the first quarter, even for the first quarter there is still significant visibility challenges. Now we do expect a significant sequential drop in revenue due to, like you say, last year on product sales, the normal seasonal impact in particular in North Sea, Russia, China as well as in Marine Seismic and also the exchange rate impact in particular from Venezuela and Russia is going to felt. And the last part which is kind of new this year is further activity and pricing impact from the reduced E&P CapEx spend. So what we have done is and we have tailored our cost space for revenues to be around the levels for the first quarter of last year. So this involves a range of cost measures taken in Q4 including the release of the 9,000 people that we quoted. So I would say I am comfortable with our cost structure with respect to this base case of Q1 activity around revenue levels of Q1 of last year. Now this activity is stronger, we have means to cover it, and if it is lower we have the ability to quickly cut more.
Bill Sanchez: Okay. So 1Q revenue '15 equal to 1Q revenue '14 overall?
Paal Kibsgaard: I am not saying that the revenue is going to be that, I am saying that that's how we have tailored our cost base.
Bill Sanchez: Okay. So if I just get back then to the headcount reductions then, so the reductions you have made, I guess, first, assume that this -- it seems like from the call this is strictly a North America reduction, is that in fact the case of the headcount cuts you have made so far?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, it's not. This is a global reduction and it both a combination of I would say structure headcount as well as fee capacity headcount.
Bill Sanchez: Okay. So there's still room here as your quarter-to-quarter view changes for further headcount reductions on a global basis? I guess is that a fair comment, Paal?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, as Q1 evolves we will firm up our view on Q2 and the playbook we run through in Q4 to be right-sized for Q1, we will repeat if necessary during the first quarter to be right-sized for Q2.
Bill Sanchez: Okay. If I could just ask one more, what should we assume right now [inaudible] of the headcount reductions that are being made currently?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I am not going to predict the cost here but I will tell you that normally we recover our costs in the severance within the following time here. It's probably more than this number. So I have already covered in fact [inaudible] be within the 2015.
Bill Sanchez: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, I will turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jud Bailey: Thank you, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Jud Bailey: Paal, one thing that strikes us about this downturn relative to what we saw in 2008 and 2009 is the urgency of some of the large operators to cut back on their offshore spending very quickly. I would be curious to get your thoughts on deepwater activity in kind of the three main basins, Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Brazil, how your customers are approaching that and how you see the outlook there over the next 12 to 18 months?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well if you look at global deepwater activity, it was down I think 6%, 7% in 2014 predominantly driven by Brazil and in 2015 at this stage and I am talking about deep water activity now, we still expect another 5% to 10% decline. Where it is going to come I think is a bit early to say. The Gulf of Mexico looks likely to be reasonably flat. As I just mentioned Brazil, there seems to be potentially further cuts in Brazil and I think there is still a bit lack of visibility in Angola. But I would say, 5% to 10% decline in activity is what we expect which is more I think in line with what we absorbed in 2014. Now I think with a big saving in deepwater drilling spend it's going to come in 2015, it's going to be around the rig rate which started to come down in 2014 but I think the big saving our customers are going to get on deepwater drilling in '15 is going to come from the rig rate.
Jud Bailey: Okay. And that kind of leads into my next question is, one thing that we've heard from rig contractors is more so than in '09 we are hearing from them that operators are approaching them more so than '09 on trying to renegotiate existing contracts. I would be curious how are your customers approaching you in terms of pricing? Are they looking to try to renegotiate existing contracts? And then also do you have a sense on the ability for you to sell them new technology to save time and cost, or are they just in the mode of trying to get cost down and not really looking at that aspect of it yet?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think on the deepwater size for our product and services, we do have discussions around trying to drive costs out of the system. But I would say our customers in this market segment in particular are still very-very focused on operational integrity and also looking at using the latest and best technologies to make sure that they drive performance through that. So we haven't really had any significant I would say price book discussions or requests for price book reduction. On the deepwater side it is more how we can work together to drive total cost down through better planning, through better execution, through less downtime, rather than specific price book discussion.
Jud Bailey: Okay. Thank you. I will turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie from Iberia Capital. Please go ahead.
Rob MacKenzie: Thank you. Good morning guys. I wanted to ask about technology adoption, something you highlighted again in your press release, specifically on US land. And my question is are you seeing a greater or lesser propensity of operators to adopt technology in the effort to drive down -- or drive up -- returns in this cycle? One might think you would but operators typically haven't always behaved that way.
Paal Kibsgaard: Oh, you are right. In North America land that has been the situation. I would say that we are seeing or in 2014 we did see a growing uptake and a growing appetite to apply new technologies to drive both higher production and lower cost to improve cost per barrel. So I would say that BroadBand family of stimulation technologies is a very good example of this. Highway was one of the first and a major technology innovations on the fact side in terms of fluids for quite a while. As we introduced it in 2011, it grew very fast. But with the BroadBand family which was introduced in the early part of 2014, this is currently growing at four times the pace. So part of this is that we have engaged our customers in a slightly different way this time around for BroadBand and we have met myself and my team included with a range of our customers at the CEO, COO level to lay out firstly what the technology does but also to give them introductory offers to basically demonstrate what these technologies can do and I believe that when we introduce them in this way then the adaptation to all these organizations actually is quicker and more significant.
Rob MacKenzie: So when they come to you as many of them say they are doing now coming to their vendors and asking for price concessions, how does that change the conversation?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I think our customers still look to drive down total cost or improved cost per barrel and when they engage in these discussions there is already pretty clear on the standing of what some of these technologies have already done for them, and when we have commercial discussions these improvements and these benefits that we offer are factored into the overall situation when we discussed pricing with them.
Rob MacKenzie: Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given to you at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2014 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your questions after our prepared segments. Please limit to one question and a related follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.49. This is an increase of $0.12 sequentially and is $0.20 higher when compared to the same quarter last year and represents increases of 9% and 16% respectively. Third quarter revenue of $12.6 billion increased 4.9% sequentially. Pretax operating income increased 7.1% sequentially, while pretax operating margins improved 45 basis points to 22.2%. Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3.2 billion increased 2.9%, while margin improved by 29 basis points to 30%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in testing services, improved WesternGeco marine utilization and an increase in SIS software sales. These increases were offset in part by lower multiclient sites. Drilling Group revenue of $4.8 billion increased 3.6% and margins improved by 60 basis points to 21.7%. These increases were largely attributable to robust drilling and measurement activity in offshore North America, Latin America and Russia and strong IPM activity in Mexico. The second quarter acquisition of Saxon also contributed to the revenue growth. Production Group revenue of $4.7 billion increased 8.1%. This growth was led by well services largely as a result of the rebound from the spring breakup in Canada and a strong performance on US land. An increase in completion of product sales in Latin America and the Middle East and Asia and expanding artificial lift sales in North America also contributed to the growth. Margin expanded by 158 basis points to 18.3%, primarily as a result of the rebound from the Canadian spring breakup as well as from improved efficiency and recovery of logistical cost in well services. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 22.1% in the third quarter compared to 21.7% in the previous quarter. During the quarter, we generated $3.1 billion of cash flow from operations. For the first nine months of this year, we have generated $7.3 billion of cash flow from operations. This compares to $6.6 billion for the same nine months of 2013. As we mentioned, starting last quarter, we began to report SPM investment separately in our cash flow statement, similar to the way we report CapEx and multiclient. While this change has no impact on our free cash flow, it does result in an increase in the amount of cash flow from operations that we report. The 2013 cash flow from operations figure has been restated to reflect this change. Net debt decreased $221 million during the quarter to $5.8 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.5 billion of stock repurchases, $519 million of dividend payments and $980 million of CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM. During the quarter, we repurchased 13.9 million shares at an average price of $108.41. CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013. And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results set a new record for Schlumberger, driven by North America and further backed by robust international performance. In the international markets, growth was led by Latin America and Europe, CIS and Africa in spite of headwinds in Russia and Libya, while Middle East and Asia proved highly resilient in the face of a significant slowdown in Northern Iraq. Third quarter revenue grew 5% sequentially and 9% year-on-year, while pretax operating income increased 7% sequentially and 12% year-on-year. Several factors contributed to this performance, including continued market penetration of new technologies that helped further drive our international margins as well as margin gains in North America from operational efficiency and market share improvements. Overall our performance demonstrated the advantage of size and the benefit of a broad technology offering and operational footprint, while providing further proof of our leadership in technology, reliability, efficiency and integration. In terms of our financial performance, we generated more than $1.8 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total up to $3.7 billion. This represents a 29% increase over the comparable period in 2013 and a conversion of 93% of our third quarter earnings into free cash flow. Based on our improved ability to generate free cash, we continued our active stock buyback program during the quarter, buying back $1.5 billion of stock, which puts us firmly on track to complete our $10 billion buyback program within the stated two-and-a-half year period. Looking at the operating areas, our North American results set a new record with revenue up 9% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, while margins increased by 137 basis points to reach 19.4%. This is in spite of headwinds from heavy rainfall in the Permian Basin that limited land activity in the US, loop currents that slowed offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico and very low multiclient seismic sales. In Canada, activity rebounded well after the spring break up in the second quarter. And this together with a further increase in land activity in the US helped generate record land revenue, representing a 9% increase sequentially. Much of this increase came from hydraulic fracturing operations, where stage counts were higher, where we also obtained improved cost recovery from our customers and where we saw strong performance from our supply chain and distribution organization following the challenges we experienced in Q2. Offshore revenue improved by 12% sequentially, driven by strong activity in Eastern Canada and by market share gains in drilling services in the Gulf of Mexico. North America also benefited from further growth and expansion of our artificial lift business and I will return to this growth initiative later in the call. Our international business posted strong results again in the third quarter with a 3% sequential increase in revenue and with pretax operating margin expanding 55 basis points to 24.6%, which is the highest level seen in five years in spite of the geopolitical headwinds experienced in Russia, Northern Iraq and Libya. Compared to the third quarter of last year, international revenue was up 5% on the back of strong growth in key markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Australia and with strong incremental margins at 50%. In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive for basic services, and we see no sign of any general pricing inflection. However we continue to be able to drive effective pricing through sale of new and unique technology together with continued growth in integration and performance-based contracts. This combination puts us in a very strong competitive position, which we continue to leverage to drive market share gains and expand operating margins. Within the international areas, revenue in Latin America was up by a strong 10% sequentially, with margins increasing to 21.9% and with all geo markets recording growth. Compared to the third quarter last year, Latin America revenue was up 5%, driven by Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, with moderate growth in Mexico and lower revenues in Brazil. Pretax operating income also increased year-over-year, driven by strong activity throughout our broad and diverse contracts portfolio as well as through careful cost and resource management. In Argentina, strong sequential growth was driven by rig-based activity for development of both conventional and unconventional resources. Customers are now seeing clear results from applying our industry-leading shale workflows and technologies in terms of both increased production and greater efficiency. In Mexico, revenue grew on higher IPM project work on land, resolution of the social issues related to our project in the south in addition to stronger deporter activity. As the energy reform continues to move ahead, we won a significant multi-year contract to build and manage a national data repository and to prepare data rooms that will be needed for the country's first public oil tenders next year. In Venezuela, activity increased further in the third quarter, supported by strong uptake of new technology, while payments continue to be made in line with the signed agreements. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew 1% sequentially, while margins improved by 132 basis points to 23.4%, as exploration activities strengthen in Angola and new projects started in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew by 4% and margins were up by 103 basis points. Activity in Russia benefited from a strong summer season, particularly offshore Sakhalin and in the Arctic, but growth was tempered by the impact of international sanctions. Earlier in the third quarter, we announced the likely effects of sanctions on our results in Russia and this ultimately translated into a $0.02 impact coming from restructuring costs to remaining compliance and some impact from activity and a weaker ruble. In other parts of the Europe, CIS and Africa area, activity was mixed in the North Sea with increased software sales in the UK, but lower activity in Norway as peak seismic and drilling activity ended. In North Africa, significant operational delays were experienced in Nigeria and activity slowed in Tunisia ahead of the November election. Operations in Libya continues to be challenging with a complex security situation and with activity remaining at the minimal level. We are currently carefully evaluating our operational structure in the country and will resize resources in accordance with the 2015 activity outlook. On the positive side, however, we remain active offshore and we continue to have a constructive view on the long-term potential of the country. In the Middle East and Asia area, revenue was essentially flat with the previous quarter, with margins stable at 27.6% as growth in Saudi Arabia and Oman offset lower revenue in Iraq and India and with activity in Asia largely unchanged from the second quarter. Year-on-year revenue increased by 6% and margins grew by 149 basis points. In the Middle East, activity growth was strongest in Saudi Arabia with new rigs mobilizing, exploration activity strengthening and development drilling increasing. We have added resources to match the additional work in the country and we expect to see further increases in activity as more drilling rigs are added and rig-less activity continued to expand. We also saw solid growth in Oman with strong artificial lift product sales and market share gains in drilling services. Elsewhere in the Middle East, activity was lower in India on lower product sales and the effects of the monsoon season. Activity was also lower in Northern Iraq as unrest in the area increased and forced a complete shutdown of our operations for part of the third quarter. The security situation has improved more recently and rigs are slowly returning to work. In Southern Iraq, there was no security impact on our operations in the third quarter, but activity remains lower compared to the same quarter last year as new contract awards continue to be delayed. With government approvals, our new contract award is still pending. We do not expect any significant improvement in activity in the near term. Southeast Asia revenue was also flat for the second quarter as activity slowdowns in Australia and lack of exploration success in Malaysia and Thailand were offset by stronger activity in Vietnam, marine seismic work in Brunei and improved product sales in other Asia geo markets. China saw a sequential growth in shale gas development on land together with continuing strong activity offshore in Bohai Bay. Elsewhere in China, activity continued to be slow and we do not see further growth until our customers' spending plans become clearer. I would now like to update you on the progress we have made in our artificial lift business since we outlined our growth strategy for this market in New York in June. First, in addition to our existing basin coverage in North America established through an active M&A program over the past year, we have in the third quarter completed several new acquisitions to further expand our operational footprint in Canada. Second, in line with our goal of optimizing cost efficiency and reliability, we have injected additional supply chain, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to our road lift organization to drive additional value from the signed quality assurance, sourcing and distribution. Third, in order to address the growing market for LIVE for well lift solutions in the unconventional market, we have combined all Schlumberger artificial lift technologies in North America into a single organization that will cover ESP, PCP gas lift and rod lift systems. This has given us one customer-facing organization with a complete technical portfolio capable of recognizing business opportunities throughout the entire spectrum of the artificial lift market. Integration of the various components of this organization is progressing very well, with our ultimate goal being to offer our customers a complete range of industry-leading technology together with best-in-class local service. We remain on track to sell more than 7,000 pump jacks and installing over 5,000 PCPs in 2014 in North America. And through the careful execution of our growth strategy over the past year, we have now firmly assumed the leadership position in the global artificial lift market. I would also like to give you a progress report of the transformation program we outlined in New York where we're already starting to change the way we manage our people, our assets and our inventory to further improve our financial performance. In Southeast Asia, we concluded the successful piloting of a centralized asset management and maintenance facility for our Wireline product line, reducing the downhole tool fleet by more than 30% compared to the previous level required to service the region. The surplus of assets that this initiative created have already been redeployed to capture new business opportunities and support growth in other regions, and our Wireline product line is in the process of expanding this model to other areas. We have also extended the coverage of our regional distribution centers to new areas in South America, resulting in an average 10% reduction in spares on hand versus 2013 for the product lines currently involved. Worldwide coverage for spares distribution will be achieved in the coming months with the creation of a third distribution center in Rotterdam. Implementation of revised job execution and competency assurance process also continue and is already showing notable reliability improvements. In Wireline, the systematic deployment on new standard work constructions has already in 2014 produced a 30% reduction in customer non-productive time compared to last year. Turning now to the economic environment, the outlook for global GDP growth softened somewhat during the third quarter on weaker data from Europe and China also leading to a slight downward revision of the absolute oil demand outlook. Given the strength of the US economy and the ongoing efforts to stimulate and manage growth in Europe and China, we continue to believe that the slow, but steady recovery and the world economy is still intact and that the overall oil demand situation is largely unchanged. While market sentiments are currently driven by short-term oversupply due to the continued growth in North America production, we still see the supply situation as relatively well balanced given the continued challenges in the non-NAM non-OPEC production base, lack of growth in OPEC's sustainable production capacity maintaining tightness in OPEC spare capacity and with the continued geopolitical risks in several key producers. We therefore expect Brent to recover and stabilize when and at the level that is deemed appropriate by the main oil producers. The key to the overall oil market is still that the global oil demand is currently set to increase by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2015, which will require growth in the EMP investments. Where the growth in EMP investments will take place will be a function of what level of the oil price stabilizes at and where a lower oil price will likely lead to more of the investment taking place in lower operating cost environment. For natural gas, markets remain comfortably supplied, although there's awkward pricing trends in Asia-Pacific and Europe as winter approaches. Based on this macro setting, which continues to include a mix of economic and geopolitical headwinds and tailwinds, we maintained a long-term view that we outlined in June in New York, believing in continued solid demand for our products, services and expertise. We also firmly believe that opportunities exist for differentiated growth through new technology and greater integration and that the transformational impact of our reliability and efficiency programs will further support and accelerate our financial outperformance. That concludes my remarks. Thank you. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Excellent execution. I have a few questions on various technologies but I think I’m going to leave that for now. Probably what is on everybody's minds right now is the oil balance and the tipping point in oil and where we stand, the volatility has been tremendous. I think everybody is confused about what level of CapEx will be required given what's going on in Europe and Pandora's box talking about spare capacity and how you see it. So I wonder whether you could just expand a little bit about what gives you confidence.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think if you look at what the sentiments in the market are today, it is obviously driven by the fair order supply. But if we go back to the status of the global economy, yes, there was a downward revision in GDP growth outlook, but this was only slightly. We're still looking at 2.7% and 3.2% growth in GDP in 2014 and 2015, and this is only 0.2% down for both years. So like I said, the overall slow but steady recovery in the global economy, we believe, is still intact. Now if you look at the demand side, there was a corresponding downward revision on the oil demand for both 2014 and 2015, but the key here is to look at the absolute demand, because the IEA for 2014 changed both the 2013 actual demand and the updated 2014 demand. So if we look at the 2014 absolute demand, it is still at the February level and only 0.2 million barrels a day down from the July peak. And the 2015 absolute demand is now 93.5, which is still 1.1 million barrels a day up. So based on this, we see the demand side of the oil market also as more or less unchanged. So then what's left is to look at the real supply situation, and we don't think that has changed dramatically in terms of fundamental supply capacity since Q2 as well. And that's because there is lack of growth in OPEC sustainable production capacity. And actually if you look at IEA report, the OPEC sustainable production capacity is actually down 800,000 barrels a day in September of 2014 versus last year. There is also continued weakness in non-NAM non-OPEC production and there is still geopolitical risk related to both Libya and Iraq. So based on this, we see the overall supply picture as more or less unchanged as well versus Q2. So with the growth in demand for next year, we believe that there has to be increased spending levels and where this spending is going to take place, I think, is going to be a function of where the oil price stabilizes. At the lower oil price, we believe that more of these investments will take place in lower operating cost environments. And if the oil price stabilizes back at the levels we saw earlier this year, then we might continue with a similar picture next year as we had this year. So that's our overall view.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: To summarize, Paal, you believe that the spare capacity in the global system today is going down for the next two years?
Paal Kibsgaard: What I would say at least it's not going up. So far this year, it's been flat. When more production is offered into the market, it is at the expense of the spare capacity.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Paal, I was hoping you could frame in light of your macro outlook perceived international opportunities and threats or headwinds and tailwinds, if you will, and how that at least conceptually coalesces into an outlook for next year? I mean the market of late seems to have been unduly focused on the prominent threats. And then moreover also if you could comment on margins as well. I was struck by how resilient your Eastern Hemisphere margins were in light of the dislocation that unfolded in the third quarter.
Paal Kibsgaard: We are very pleased with the performance of our international business, including Latin America. So year-to-date, international revenue is up by 5%, which is outgrowing the growth in EMP spending in international market. And our operating income is up 15% with incremental margins of 66%. So today our margin stands internationally at 24.6%, which is the highest level we've seen since the 2008 pre-financial crisis peak. And I think it's important to notice as well that about 80% of our global operating income growth so far in 2014 is actually generated in the international market on a relatively low growth in EMP spend. So if you look at what happened in 2014, like you say, there was a good mix of tailwinds and headwinds. And if you look at the tailwinds this year in terms of geographies, it's been Argentina, Ecuador, Sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi and the UAE, in terms of the type of basins, it's been land and conventional offshore that's been driving the growth. And in terms of customer groups, it's been independents and NOCs. Now if you look at the flip side for the headwinds, geographically it's been Brazil, Mexico, Libya, Russia, Iraq and China in term of the basins has been deepwater and exploration and in particular seismic. And also in customer groups, it's been the IOCs going from solid growth to flat spending in 2014. Now these headwinds will make up around $1.1 billion of full year revenue reduction for us versus 2013. So looking at our full year revenue growth for 2014 in the international market, it's going to be around 5%. And that includes absorbing all these significant headwinds. And we've managed this growth at the same time as we have expanded margins by about 200 basis points and as I mentioned very strong incrementals. So it really demonstrates the strength and the earnings growth resilience we have in our international business. Now if you look at 2015, we expect that we will continue to see a mix of headwinds and tailwinds in the international market. The tailwinds may not be as strong depending on where the EMP spend levels are, but several of the headwinds will largely diminish as well. Brazil and Mexico are likely to be tailwinds next year. And deepwater exploration as well as Libya, Iraq, China should also be less of a drag than what we saw this year. So that really leaves Russia and Asia as the main headwinds that we're going to be facing and the overall balance will become fairer in these two regions in Q4. So still we expect to see strong earnings growth from our international business also in 2015.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Your market share gains, you mentioned, in Gulf of Mexico and the 12% revenue growth were impressive, considering that we've all been reading and hearing about loop currents and weather and you guys had won the bad weather. Can you talk to us a little bit about your mix, your customer mix and the other things that are allowing you to do so well in the Gulf of Mexico?
Paal Kibsgaard: Jim, we have a broad portfolio. We have a good balance in the Gulf of Mexico between characterization drilling and production. Our offshore business in North America also includes a very strong position offshore Eastern Canada, which was also quite strong in Q3. But we were impacted by the loop currents, but at the same time, we have a sizeable business. And while some rigs were shut down for this, there were a number of rigs continuing to operate without any impact. So when you have a certain size and some of these events, it's easier to absorb them as you go forward.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: I agree completely on the outlook for spending and the need to maintain current production, but clearly US independents spin-off of cash flow and so that puts the US activity probably most at risk. I guess my question is, is there a risk that pressure pumping pricing in a slower market crashes again like it did a couple of years ago or have we had enough capital discipline in the industry that that's not likely to happen?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think it's going to be a function of activity, of course. So like you say, we agree that the 2015 activity, it's too early to say what's going to happen. But it is clearly going to be a function of the level of free cash flow for the EMPs, which was already negative in general at the WTI of 90. And the key going forward is going to be continued borrowing capacity. So there's really two scenarios here that we end up with a lower WTI, further cost inflation in the EMP value chain and reduced borrowing capacity, and this will likely have an impact on the spending growth rates. On the flip side, if we see a recovery of the WTI and also we see a limited cost inflation in the EMP value chain, I think these are the factors that would support further spending growth. But looking at pressure pumping pricing, it's going to be a function of the activity levels and how much horsepower capacity has been ordered in the past couple of quarters. And I believe that it's a fair bit already on order. So if the spending growth is impacted, I think it can quickly put pressure on frac pricing, including both sand and transportation as well.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of James West with ISI Group.
James West - ISI Group: In the release in your remarks, I was struck by how many times you highlighted strength in deepwater activity and strong exploration activity, particularly in deepwater drilling. It seems like there is a big debate in the market right now about deepwater. How do you see that activity evolving over the next year or two?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think if you look at first the deepwater rig supply, it was at the record high in Q3. At the same time, the number of stacked rigs continued to increase. And there's a further 10-year rigs planned for delivery in Q4. So I think it's very clear that we are in oversupply situation of deepwater rigs at this stage. Now if you look at deepwater drilling, which is really where we make most of our revenue, this year we expect to see a 6% decline in drilling rig activity for deepwater. Now this decline is mainly driven by Brazil, which is down about over 30%, and partially offset by the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. So when you exclude Brazil, deepwater drilling is actually up about 3% versus 2013. So looking forward to 2015, we see flattish deepwater drilling activity in 2015, generally supported by lower rig rates. So we've weathered, I think, a fairly significant deepwater decline this year and we expect it to be more or less flattish going forward into next year.
James West - ISI Group: A lot of the commentary was around deepwater exploratory wells. Has your percentage of wells that you're working on a deepwater on the exploration side decreased, is it steady, is it increasing?
Paal Kibsgaard: If you look at the overall exploration market and the exploration spend, we expect now that the 2014 exploration spend will be down 45% versus last year. And this spend reduction is mainly led by seismic, which would be down more than 20%, while the exploration drilling is only slightly down. So I would say that the market is down overall, but the main driver for the reduction in exploration spend is predominantly seismic.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Nice to see that big $1.5 billion buyback. As a follow-up to one of the earlier questions on pressure pumping and the just the soft North America and obviously its influx, I do believe that Schlumberger was considering building incremental new build capacity for 2015 given the market dynamics. How do you feel on that now? Is that on hold? What are your thoughts?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we have a pretty sizeable pressure pumping business, which is including both North America and international. So we have made some orders for new pumps. We still have some pumps left in the idle asset program. But we made some orders for new pumps by the level that it doesn't really worry me. These new pumps will be distributed in between North America and international. And we've had fairly significant growth both in Argentina and Saudi Arabia over the past six to 12 months. So the orders that we've made is generally what we want to have on order in terms of long lead items to make sure that we can cover the business in any eventuality.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Obviously the Middle East is very strong, particularly the Saudi. But just theoretically, in the Middle East overall, excluding Iraq of course, where do you think Brent would need to be for them to begin to slow their drilling activities where they start to become uncomfortable? I know obviously they're drilling both for gas and for oil.
Paal Kibsgaard: I'm not going to make any predictions at what level the Saudis would change what they're doing. We have a very strong business in Saudi Arabia. Growth has been very strong this year. And as of now, we continue to expect solid growth in Saudi Arabia next year as well.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: Paal, you mentioned the potential for inflation in frac value chain in US onshore. And I was just curious, given that most of that is now being driven by sand and transportation and distribution related to sand, how is that impacting the market for highway and broadband?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think there's no real impact from these things in particular to broadband and highway. I think the escalating cost of transportation and sand at this stage I think is something that all the players are looking to pass on to the customers. I think there's going to be a limit to how much of these additional cost escalation that our customers are prepared to take, given their free cash flow situation and also given the drop in oil prices. But there is no relative impact on these cost escalations on either broadband or highway.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: Well, I was thinking more from a marketing standpoint if the sand availability would actually push customers to look for productivity improving alternatives such as highway and broadband?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, we do use less sand in highway in particular. So that is obviously a selling point. But it is more a function of what the philosophy of the customer is. Do they want to go with a slickwater frac, which generally now has a lot higher volume of proppant, or they go to a more cross-linked or highway type of frac, in which case the proppant volume is significantly less.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: And are you seeing a shift in trend, one versus the other materially over the last couple of quarters?
Paal Kibsgaard: Not materially. Highway continues to do very well. And I'm actually very pleased with how broadband is going. Broadband at this stage of its introduction is growing significantly faster than what highway did back in 2011/2012. And we are now continuing to engage in broadband, I would say, presentations and broadband sales and information at the sea level of our customers. So we engage at that level to establish a very clear understanding of what this technology brings and also to try to agree on pilot programs and evaluation of these pilot programs over a period of time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC.
Kurt Hallead - RBC: I wanted to follow up in particular on two things. You mentioned cost recovery dynamics that have been underway in the North American market. Do you feel that you're at a point now where you'll be able to get some net margin accretion going forward, or is it still just offset to the cost inflation?
Paal Kibsgaard: I still think in terms of price increases with our customers, we're generally looking to recover the cost inflation that we're seeing. Like we said before, we believe that the main way of driving margins in the North America pressure pumping business will be through efficiency and through introduction of new technologies that increases production or lowers cost or improves efficiency. So the main focus that we have now is to pass on the cost inflation that we have from our supply chain to our customers. And like I said, given the state of the free cash flow and where the oil price is, I think the appetite from our customers will be lower in terms of how much of the further cost increases they're willing to take.
Kurt Hallead - RBC: In terms of the challenges that occurred during the course of the third quarter that resulted in that announcement that the earnings would be impacted by $0.02 to $0.03 and the comment that you made about being a $0.02 impact in particular, what kind of lingering effect do you expect from Russia and maybe Libya going out into the fourth quarter?
Paal Kibsgaard: If you look at Q4 as a whole, this year we expect sequential growth in earnings per share probably around $0.05 to $0.07. That's our target. This is somewhat lower than the sequential increases we normally see in Q4. And there's really two primary reasons for that. One, as you alluded to, we expect to see a continued impact from the situations in Libya, Iraq and Russia and in particular the ruble effect in Russia is potentially going to be higher in Q4 than what we saw in Q3. The second main factor is the cost focus that our customers have, which is likely going to lead to lower levels of year-end sales, including both software products, but in particular multiclient. Still the base business should continue to be solid, driven by both North America, Latin America and the Middle East, but somewhat lower sequential growth in earnings per share in Q4 this year than what we normally see.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: I think one of the things that's been a surprise to many is how much supply growth we see in that region. At a time when seems like you and others are really contracting in the area and there is very little service activity going on, just given your macro thoughts so far during the call, what are your views in terms of sustainability of Libyan production here given there's ramp-down in activity? And I guess what's the trigger point for you to make a decision on whether or not you start to cut headcount there, and is that strictly going to be just on land side or is that going to be offshore as well?
Paal Kibsgaard: In terms of our resource base, that's something that we continue to look at in any country that we're in. Offshore, we're currently operating one rig. There might be another couple of rigs added in the next couple of quarters, but that's not a significant part of the headcount that is related to the offshore activity. The main headcount is focused on the land business. And the land business is, as I said, at the minimal level. So we are currently looking at what the outlook for 2015 is. Q3 of 2014 is about 50% down in activity in Libya compared to what we saw in Q3 of last year. And that low activity in our mind, if it's not changed, we'd obviously have an impact on the sustainable production capacity of Libya going forward. So the fact that Libya, which I think in OPEC now is listed as about 900,000, but obviously the key to maintain that production capacity is to continuously invest into it.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: You mentioned Brazil now as a tailwind for next year. I know there's a Wireline services contract that's pending. Can you talk about timing on that? And would that be incremental to Schlumberger or is that strictly just a re-tender here of an existing contract?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, the two main contracts that have been out for tender recently have been the Wireline services one and the directional drilling (inaudible) contract. We maintain the market share we had in both contracts. We had the largest lot in Wireline and the middle lot in drilling and measurement, which we see as good, because it basically prevents us from having any significant mobilization or demobilization cost which are always key to the profitability of these types of contracts. And both of those contracts we got quite reasonable price increases while we maintain our market share. So activity-wise or market share-wise, no change for us, but the pricing and really no additional cost of mobilizing or demobilizing. So I would say that these contracts are incremental to Schlumberger in 2015. I expect the contracts to be finalized over the next couple of quarters.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: In talking about the exploration results for you all, obviously seismic is down, but in the release several times the success in Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa specifically, there's been tailwinds for margins. Just given the customer degree of exploration success this year, how does that impact your view of, say, the next 12 to 15 months, just specifically in terms of how it could impact the ECA region?
Paal Kibsgaard: I agree with you. The exploration success both in 2013 and 2014 has been relatively poor, which I think is part of the reason why a number of customers are taking a step back and reevaluating their prospects and then how they're going to go about doing this. So like I said, we see exploration spend this year being down 4% to 5% driven by seismic. But looking towards 2015, we expect exploration spend to be flattish to only slightly down. And again, this is going to be driven by seismic. So we continue to see good exploration drilling activity and the main thing impacting exploration spend is still going to be seismic next year.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: The success you're having in bucking the overall trend, how much of the integration that you discussed back in June is a driving force in that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think the impact of the whole range of transformation of efforts that we're doing as well as new technology and as well as our integration capabilities, all of these elements are key factors that allows us to produce outstanding results, in particular in the international market. And we expect that strength to continue to grow and expand going forward, as we further implement these transformational programs.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo.
Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo: In Norway, you've had StatOil who is starting to scale back activity and now you add on to that. You got a little bit lower commodity prices. I'd be curious to know how you see that market playing out maybe over the next one to two years with commodity prices as a headwind and StatOil kind of suffering through some cost overruns.
Paal Kibsgaard: In terms of what the commodity price is going to be, I think it's too early to say what level it's going to be at in 2015. Obviously there's been a sharp drop over the past two to four weeks. How this is going to evolve I think is still highly uncertain, and I still believe that there's going to be some kind of recovery happening. Now rate into the North Sea, we still see low single-digit growth in activity for our North Sea geo market in 2015. And you got to break that down into three. First in Norway, we expect to see lower exploration activity and flat development activity. In the UK, we actually expect to see somewhat higher exploration activity next year and still flat development activity. And in addition to this, other in North Sea geo market, we continue to manage somewhat the remote activities, and there's strong remote activity next year. We have project in the Canaries. We have a project in Cyprus. And we also have a project in Mauritania that we manage out of the North Sea. So overall for that business unit and the assets and the resources we have in the North Sea, we see still some growth in 2015.
Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo: You noted all the various headwinds and tailwinds internationally for 2015. It looks like, and you've alluded to this, Latin America is poised to finally show a nice recovery. Knowing what you know today, will Latin America be your best growth market in 2015 versus even the Middle East and Asia?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think it's still too early to say. But if you look at the trends that we saw in Q3, we are clearly seeing the recovery of Latin America with good growth in pretty much every geo market. So I'm quite optimistic about what Latin America can do next year. And one thing is the revenue growth. The other thing is the pretax operating income growth. And I would say for next year, I'm quite optimistic at this stage still on Latin America in terms of growing earnings and similarly also for Europe, Africa as well as the Middle East. So those will still, I think, be the three main drivers of earnings growth in the international market next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Handler with Jefferies.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: I'd like to come back to your artificial lift initiative. Maybe as a grounding for us, can you ballpark the revenue contribution that you've acquired just in terms of framing for us your starting point for growth?
Paal Kibsgaard: I can, but I won't. If you want to try to make some interpretation, we gave you some numbers on installations of pump jacks and PCPs. It might not be easily transferrable to revenue, but we've had a big program. We bought a number of smaller companies. And it has a reasonable contribution to North America and also to our overall artificial lift position. But I'm not going to break out and give you a specific revenue number.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: In an environment if there's a somewhat lower commodity price, what is your sense of the impact on artificial lift on the production side of the business, maybe a little bit more broadly presumably in the North America market?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, for the overall production business in the event that activity is down in North America, any part of the business might have challenges and pressure on pricing. I think again where you'll see it the fastest and the most will likely be in pressure pumping. In terms of artificial lift, we have not seen the same uptick in pricing when activity is very high, and I don't expect to see the same kind of pressure there as well. But any flattening of growth or reduction in activity will likely have an impact on pricing in any product line. But I think it's way too early to say even for North America whether we will be in that situation in 2015.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citi.
Scott Gruber - Citi: Another scenario if crude prices stay low, your project management businesses, both drilling and production, should be real differentiators. How bigger are these businesses as a percentage of revenue now, and given the contract backlog, what's the growth outlook for '15?
Paal Kibsgaard: We're not breaking out these numbers. Other than that, we've given some indication of how much our integration related business is. That's not all project management or production management. That's any type of integration. In a more challenging environment, the ability to take on projects and provide more integration to drive value will be a competitive strength.
Scott Gruber - Citi: And I believe that there's some flex in how you pursue with your internal transformation given market dynamics. So if we paint a scenario where upstream CapEx flattens and the expectation is flat for a few years, can you provide some color on what changes you make to your program and how quickly you think you can achieve some of your targets, realizing that some are partially dependent upon customer acceptance of your tools? How quickly do you think you can accelerate some of those changes?
Paal Kibsgaard: We have some discretion as to what we can accelerate in terms of the implementation, but some of these things are also based on the overall schedule that we've laid out and things that we have to develop in order to roll them out. But yes, there is some flexibility of accelerating investment and implementation in terms of part of the transformation. And these are things we are actually looking at now. We laid out our financial targets for 2017 in June in New York. And they were predicated on macro and industry assumptions. And if these assumptions end up being optimistic, we will see what we can do internally to still be within the ranges that we've given or at least close to them even if the macro assumptions are below. I can't promise that we will do it, but that's obviously going to be the ambition. So new technology introductions, new technology sales and acceleration of transformation programs are going to be key drivers that potentially would allow us to do that.
Operator: And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Farrant for any closing comments.
Simon Farrant: Well, that's all the time we have for questions today. Now on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating. And Cynthia will provide the closing comments.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2014 results conference call. Today’s call is being hosted from Paris, where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I’d like to remind the participants that some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your questions after our prepared statements. I will now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.37. This is an increase of $0.16 sequentially and is $0.22 higher when compared to the same quarter last year, represents increases of 13% and 19% respectively. During the quarter, we recorded $205 million charge in discontinued operations relating to the potential resolution with the governmental authorities concerning historical matter. Please refer to the supplement information contained in our earnings press release for further details. Second quarter revenue of $12.1 billion increased 7.3% sequentially. Pre-tax operating income increased 10.7% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 67 basis points to 21.7%. Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir characterization revenue of $3.1 billion increased 8.5% and pre-tax income grew by almost 18%. This resulted in margins improving by 233 basis points to 29.7%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in wireline, improved WesternGeco marine utilization, and an increase in SIS software sales. Drilling group revenue of $4.7 billion increased 7.4% and margin improved by 74 basis points to 21.1%. These increases were largely attributable to robust international activity in M-I SWACO and strong drilling and measurement activity in North America and Russia. Production group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 5.5%. This growth was led by well services as a strong performance internationally and in U.S. land more than compensated for the impact of the spring breakup in Canada. Margins declined by 123 basis points to 16.7% primarily as a result of pressure pumping commodity inflation combined with the impact of the Canadian spring breakup. Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.7% in the second quarter compared to 22.6% in the previous quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2014 to be in the low to mid 20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business. During the quarter, we generated $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations. For the first six months of this year, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This compares to $3.8 billion for the first six months of 2013. As we have mentioned at our Investors Day, our investment in SPM business have now reached a point that’s starting this year. We have begun to report them separately in our cash flow statement, similar to the way we report CapEx and multi-client. While this change has no impact on our free cash flow, it does result in an increase in the amount of cash flow from operations that we report. Net debt increased $1 billion during the quarter to $6.1 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of stock repurchases, $522 million of dividend payments, and $922 million of CapEx, excluding multi-client and SPM. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.5 million shares at an average price of $101.85. CapEx, including multi-client and SPM, is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013. And now, I will turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Simon. Our second quarter results were strong and fully in line with our expectations as international activity rebounded in Russia, Norway and Australia and North American activity grew in both offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and on land in spite of the Canadian spring breakup. As a result, second quarter revenue grew 7% sequentially and 8% year-on-year while pre-tax operating income increased by 11% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. Year-to-date, we continued to show solid growth in all our main financial indicators compared to last year, with revenue and operating income growing by 7% and 18% respectively, pre-tax margins expanding by 191 basis points, earnings per share increasing by 22% and the incremental margins at a solid 48%. Several factors are contributing to the strength of this performance. These include additional market share gains at the back of new technology sales and operational efficiency as well as further support from strong quality cost and resource management throughout our global operations. Our overall financial results continued to demonstrate our leadership in technology, reliability, efficiency and integration, which formed the four components of our engine of outperformance that we detailed at our June investor conference in New York and which will continue to drive our corporate performance in the years to come. In the second quarter, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow bringing the year-to-date number to $1.9 billion, which is 35% higher than for the same period last year. The strength of our cash flow reinforces the confidence we have in the financial targets we laid out at our June conference and will also enable us to further invest in the business while increasing the cash we returned to our shareholders. Our international business continued to perform well in the second quarter with seasonal rebound of activity coupled with growth in key markets leading to an 8% sequential increase in revenue, while pre-tax operating margin expanded by 122 basis points to reach 24%, a level not seen since the pre-financial crisis peak of 2008. Compared to the second quarter of last year, international revenue was up 7% when adjusting for Framo on the back of strong growth in the Middle East in Asia and in Europe, Africa. In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive and we have still not seen any signs of a general pricing inflection. However, our latest technology and our best-in-class service quality continue to carry a premium, which together with the growth in integration related activity is reflected in our strong top line and margin performance. The premium in effective pricing together with our ongoing transformation programs focused on reliability and efficiency puts us in a very competitive position in the international markets which we are using to drive both market share gains and further expand margins. In Latin America, revenue was up 5% sequentially while margins were essentially flat with the previous quarter at 21.2%. Compared to the second quarter last year Latin America revenue was down 3% driven by Brazil and Mexico where the impact of lower activity on pricing were only partly offset by the strong activity in Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela. Pretax operating margins however, was up 62 basis points due to careful cost and resource management as well as our broad and diverse business portfolio in the region. The stronger sequential revenue growth was recorded in Venezuela where we also renewed our payment agreement with PdVSA during the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year our revenues in Venezuela this quarter was up significantly while we at the same time have reduced both DSO and the absolute value of our receivables. In Argentina the strong sequential growth was driven by rig-based activity in the Vaca Muerta shale where we are now seeing encouraging results from the application of new technology and work flows and where a continued focus on the well cost reduction is also improving performance. In Ecuador we continued to progress on the Shushufindi SPM project. And during the quarter we also signed a letter of intent for Group 1 of the mature field tender with contract signature and ramp up of operations expected in the second half of this year. In Mexico revenue fell sequentially and year-over-year due to lower overall rig count in the county, continued budget restrictions in Pemex and as several of our IPM rigs in the south were shutdown for the entire quarter due to local social issues that are outside of our control. However, the activity outlook for the second half of the year is stronger as we continued to ramp up activity on the new mega tender contract where we have gained significant market share and as Pemex and the local government resolved the social issues impacting our IPM projects in the South. Middle East and Asia revenue increased 4% sequentially while margins grew by 161 basis points to 27.8%. The year-over-year revenues increased by 12% and margins were up by 323 basis points. In the Middle East sequential revenue growth was again driven by Saudi Arabia, where new well activity continues to expand supported by steady growth in the rig count and where rig less activity is also increasing in a number of fields. We continued to add resources and invest in additional infrastructure in the Kingdom to keep pace with the additional growth we are taking on and with the capacity and capabilities we now have on the ground our Saudi operations is quickly becoming one of the largest and most advanced setups in our global portfolio. Growth was also driven by the United Arab Emirates as activity continues to ramp up on our existing contracts together with additional seismic and completion technology deployments. In Southern Iraq activity was as expected down both sequentially and year-over-year as commercial discussions between the government and the international oil companies continue and where the situation was further complicated by mounting civil unrest during the quarter. The worsening security situation led us to take additional measures to protect our people and assets in the country, but beyond the additional costs and lower efficiency there has been no impact on our ongoing operational capabilities. However, safety remains our top priority and we continued to monitor the situation closely together with our security advisors and we are ready to take the appropriate actions should the situation worsen further. Activity in Northern Iraq on the other hand was strong in the second driven exploration drilling and we expect growth in this part of the country in the second half of the year to offset the activity drop we are seeing in the South. Turning to Asia we saw strong year-over-year growth in several geomarkets driven by higher customer activity as well as market share gains. The strongest growth was seen in Australia from continued land activity in Queensland, successful completion of the first isometric seismic survey in the Great Australian Bight and strong new technology sales for both wireline and drilling and measurements on exploration projects. In China revenue was up sequentially driven by strong offshore activity, seasonal recovery on land and our tight gas SPM project in the Ordos Basin for Yanchang Petroleum. Still year-over-year revenue was down in the second quarter due to slowdown in activity in several land basins as customers continue to review budgets and internal processes. Looking at the second half of the year, offshore activity looks strong and land activity including the shale gas developments is set to pickup from current levels. However, we expect growth rates to be somewhat tempered until our customers complete their internal reviews and spending plans are clarified. In Europe, C.I.S. and Africa, revenue grew 13% sequentially with margins improving by 180 basis points to 22.1% as activity rebounded from the first quarter seasonal lows. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew by 4% and margins were up by 158 basis points. Sequential revenue growth was driven by Russia, where we saw strong recovery in activity after a harsh winter. The underlying activity outlook both offshore and online in Russia continues to look solid and with recent contract awards in Sakhalin, we expect to finish the year on a strong note. Activity also increased strongly in the North Sea driven by seismic and core rig-related services in Norway for a number of customers. In Africa, sub-Saharan activity was solid in particular in Chad and Mozambique, while in North Africa activity rebounded sequentially with growth in both Algeria and Tunisia, but was partly offset by Libya, where activity remained subdued. In North America, our revenue grew 6% sequentially in spite of the Canadian spring breakup and 16% year-over-year as we continue to grow our market share online in hydraulic fracturing, artificial lift and drilling services. As we actively expand our land business, we are currently seeing some impact on our pre-tax operating margins, which were down 53 basis points sequentially and 170 basis points year-over-year driven by additional costs related to supply chain and transportation and on-boarding of several new companies. However, these effects should be short-lived as we continue to implement our strategic plan for our North America land business and in the process established a broad and unique platform for profitable technology-driven growth in the coming years. In our hydraulic fracturing business, we posted strong year-over-year revenue growth driven by market share gains, further improvements in operational efficiency as well as introduction of new technologies, which altogether more than offset the effects of the spring breakup in Canada. In terms of basic pressure pumping pricing, we saw some improvement in the second quarter, but this was contained to newer basins with lack of service capacity and to customers, where we still operate at very low margins. Still the pricing traction was partly offset by continued cost inflation for labor side and transportation and pricing discussions with our customers therefore continues to have a strong focus on cost recovery at this stage. In the second quarter, we also saw further improvement in our land drilling product lines, where the combination of new technology introductions, new business models and new alliances are driving both market share gains and higher operating margins. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater drilling activity was up sequentially due to the expected rebound from the operational delays that impacted the first quarter. In the second half of the year, the drilling rig count growth will flatten somewhat as some rig shift to completions related work although we still expect to see revenue growth through market share gains in several product lines. The highlight of the quarter was undoubtedly last month investor conference in New York, where we set out clear goals for continued strong growth and financial outperformance over the coming years. Our plans are built on the four key themes of technology, reliability, efficiency and integration, with technology and integration driving superior growth and reliability and efficiency improving financial performance. In terms of technology, we showed how our R&E transformation that started six years ago has led to a step change in operational performance of our products and how we continue to accelerate the pace of new technology introduction with flattening R&E investments. During the investor conference, we also laid out full details of our reliability and efficiency transformation programs and how this will change the way we manage our people, our assets and our inventory as we look to further improve our financial performance. Based on a set of realistic assumptions covering the global economy, the oil and gas markets and industry investment levels, we are confident in our ability to continue our run of financial outperformance and to deliver on the earnings per share, return on capital employed and free cash flow targets that we laid out during the conference. Turning our focus back to the remaining part of 2014, we continue to see a relatively constant mix of headwinds and tailwinds in the global economy and in our industry, which leads us to maintain our already established outlook for the year. The slow and steady recovery in the global economy is continuing and the global oil market remains relatively tight with a solid demand outlook, continued supply uncertainty related to geopolitics and with Brent prices holding steady above $100 per barrel, which should encourage oil directed investments in both the North American and international markets. The North America natural gas market appears more comfortably supplied as U.S. production continues to grow and storage levels gradually reconnect with historical averages, while the market balances in the international natural gas markets remain more or less unchanged. We continued to expect well related EMP investment levels to grow north of 6%, driven more by development and production focused activities while exploration spend will likely be flattish in 2014 driven by lower seismic spend at the IOC’s focus on free cash flow generation. Within this scenario the growth and performance drivers that we outlined in late June amplified by our broad geographical footprint, our balanced technology portfolio and our agile organization will enable us to outperform in almost any market whether in North America or anywhere else in the world. We therefore remain positive and optimistic with respect to 2014 outlook as we continued aim for solid double-digit growth in earnings per share viewing this quarter’s results as merely a steppingstone on the way to delivering the commitments we made in New York. Thank you. We will now open up for Q&A.
Simon Farrant - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Paal. Greg we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. And Paal I wonder whether you could just shed a little bit more light about what your comments on the cost structure in North America, we are seeing very large volumes of sand for example, this can hardly carry the same margin as your technology offering, so how does this impact and how did it impact the margins in the quarter and how do you see that impacting margins in the quarter and how do you see that impacting margins in North America going forward when it comes to the relative pricing power and ability to take a markup on sand costs and logistics?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. Thank you, Ole. So there is – as I said there is a lot of moving parts for us in North America at the moment. So maybe I can just take you through the picture the way I see it. So we have been focusing lately on revenue and expanding our revenue base in North America land. At $3.9 billion in the quarter, revenue was up 6% sequentially and 16% year-on-year which is a record for North America in spite of the Canadian breakup. Now the growth came from both efficiency and share, including pressure pumping, artificial lift and drilling services. In pressure pumping, we added one more fleet during the quarter and that takes the total of eight additional fleets in the past year, so we have clearly gained share in pressure pumping. So the key here is like I said expand the revenue and share base in North America land to further broaden our platform for technology driven growth in the coming years. Now with that we see some temporary impact on margins as we take on a higher proportion of somewhat lower margin businesses, but we plan to drive margins up in the coming quarters in these businesses through integration, scale and new technology introduction. And like you said as well, there were also some short-term additional costs related to supply-chain. For instance on sand where we took some higher costs because there were some significant changes in sand price and volume for several of our customers and also transportation had some higher costs due to the fact that we had a very high growth rate and transportation availability become quite tight. In addition to that you have the Canada breakup and you also have somewhat lower multi-client sales. So all in all, that drove the 53 basis points reduction, but our focus going forward again is to drive the margins back up, but on a much broader platform for revenue growth.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks, Ole.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Good morning. Paal, could you address the potential for sanctions impacting Schlumberger’s business in Russia?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, as of now nothing has really changed for our position in Russia. Sanctions were implemented earlier in the year. There were some new sanctions coming out this year. So far, that has no real impact on our business. So, as of now it’s business as usual for us. In Russia, so far this year, activity has been as planned or even slightly stronger. The only change from the plan we laid out in the – at the beginning of the year was the impact of the ruble, which had a fairly significant impact in Q1, but the ruble rebound somewhat in Q2. So, that’s really only the main change from the plan that we have seen so far in Russia. So, as of now, no impact on sanctions and whether there will be impact in the future is a bit difficult to comment on, but as of now, we continue business as usual.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Okay. And one follow-up Paal, could you talk just a little bit about the recent announcement of the deal with Precision Drilling and how quickly you think the U.S. can move to incentive pricing or some kind of integrated model? And I guess would this in that sense be shared with Precision or would this be – would Precision be working for you or are there a number of different scenarios as you look forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: So, part of the reason for doing this alliance with Precision Drilling is that both ourselves and Precision Drilling believe that over time the North America land drilling market will move towards a general contractor model, towards more of a construction turnkey type of market. And in that setup, we have now established this alliance where Precision Drilling will be the general contractor and we will rent them our downhole technologies. In addition, we will train their people to run it. And obviously, we will own the equipment and we will maintain the equipment for Precision Drilling. So, we see this as an avenue to establish further penetration for our unique technologies in the North America land drilling market and hence it’s another good growth opportunity for us.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Okay, thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you. Next question? Please check the line.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I just wanted you kind of expand a little bit about the cost pressures on your supply chain. I guess, my first question is are you able to pass through most of those costs right now you had said kind of near-term pressures, I am just wondering is that because you are expecting to get those pass-through or is it also partly because the kind of the way your transformation is setup, it just takes a little while to kind of absorb those and you start to see kind of better margins as we start to progress?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. David, I think in general, we are able to pass through those costs. What happened towards the end of Q1 and also into Q2, there were some significant changes in the way some of our customers operated in terms of sand prices, in terms of volumes and these were basically somewhat unannounced and something we have to respond to relatively quickly. We manage to continue to support our customers and support our operations, but we took some additional costs in order to do that. And over time, we are able to pass these on and lower than we manage to pass on towards the second part of this quarter, but there were some short-term changes that resulted in additional cost for us that we decided to absorb.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Alright. And then I guess my other question around that was on your logistics obviously we are very big logistics operations. As we start – as we see our North America progress over the next several years and in some of the cases we are seeing doubling of the amount of sand in wells, do you need to build that out more, are your sales I guess I am asking are you satisfied with the logistics footprint or is this an area where we need to build up a little bit better?
Paal Kibsgaard: This is all part of the entire story that I am talking about as well. We are gradually expanding that to make sure that we can meet changes to how our customers want to operate, but also continuous expansion of our business, right. So we continued to invest in that. And given the fact that we have grown so much over the past years, I mentioned eight traditional fleets in the past four quarters, we are at the point that now that we are upgrading some of this as well and that is resulting in some additional costs in this quarter.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Okay, thank you. Just a real quick question, Simon, could you just tell me where the share count was at the end of the quarter, if you don’t mind?
Simon Ayat: Okay. Well, the average for the quarter was 1.315 billion, and this is a result of what we purchased during this quarter, which is 11.5 million shares. So your question about the end of the…
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Yes, before the end of the quarter, just help me understand that?
Simon Ayat: I think towards the end of the quarter I have to confirm this figure for you will be about 1.38 billion.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Simon Ayat: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita - UBS:  Thanks. Good morning guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Simon Ayat: Good morning.
Angie Sedita – UBS:  So Paal, on the Analyst Day it certainly was clear that Schlumberger has decided that land rigs are important to furthering your technology and you just discussed the Precision deal, but you acquired earlier in the year the Saxon, 100% of Saxon, so can you talk about how that differs and the thoughts there in being able to integrate the rig with the bottom hole assembly and the timelines actually develop a newly designed rig and how many rigs that you actually put into the market over the next three years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if I first address the alliance with Precision versus the acquisition of Saxon, so Saxon is generally focused on the international market. And that’s the mean that we are going to use to pursue the international well construction market. As of now, we have decided to pursue the North America well construction market, more through alliances, and that’s where the Precision Drilling alliance comes into play. So in terms of our investment into new rig technologies, that is something we are just starting, so that’s going to obviously take a little bit of time before we have something to put into the market. So I can’t give you a specific number of how many rigs we will put in to the market, but that will be when the rig is ready. And we will then just gradually add capacity as we have viable work for these type of rigs going forward. So we have two different strategies, one is for North America through the Precision Drilling type of an alliance and through our own rigs in the international market.
Angie Sedita - UBS: That’s quite fair enough. And then on China, you hit on it on your opening comments, but clearly things have changed here with the recent events, with the corruption of CNBC and a slowdown of PetroChina, so has that just changed your near-term outlook for China or your long-term outlook as well. And now do you believe it could be difficult for the independent Chinese oil service companies to succeed in the region?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I can’t really comment on how it’s going to be for the independent Chinese companies, but I would say that the main thing that is changing for us is the short-term. We are still very bullish on the medium to long-term growth prospects in China. We are very well setup in China to be part of that through our technology and integration capabilities. So as these processes continue and hopefully draw to a conclusion over the next couple of quarters, we see growth being tempered but beyond that I am very bullish on China going forward.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay. Thanks. I will turn it over.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: Thanks. Good morning guys. Paal if I could return to the Precision in North America strategy question a little bit and maybe ask you to address it within the context of the joint venture that you did last year with Forest in the Eagle Ford, my understanding of that venture was that it was really about establishing a business model in the U.S. of integrated services and control of project, can you contrast that versus what we are seeing now in the Precision arrangement which looks more like Schlumberger as a supplier or vendor to general contractor?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think these are two different things. So, within IPM, we have two different business models, one is well construction and one is production management. And the Forest deal we did is a production management type of deal where we are paid on a feet per barrel, while the alliance with Precision is more along the well construction lines, right. So, in some cases, we end up being the general contractor and we either own the rig or rent the rig and deploy our services through that or in the case with Precision Drilling, we will be renting them our downhole equipment while they are the general contractor. So, these are different permutations of the well construction model.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: Thank you for the clarification. That helps. Simon, if I could ask a quick one for you on Venezuela and the Bolivar exposure. Paal in his prepared comments talked about the good performance even on DSOs. Can you talk about what the currency impacts are there and what they might be here in the third quarter?
Simon Ayat: So, in the third quarter, we don’t – I mean in the third quarter, our assumption that the exchange rate for the Bolivar will continue at the same rate that we are using today. And this is 6.3 Bolivar is to a dollar. Some of our revenues are in Bolivars and obviously the receivables, some of the outstanding receivables are also in Bolivars. If the exchange rate will change, will definitely impact us, I don’t know to what extent the exchange rate will change. We know about the different exchange rates that are being used and we simulate our results on the various exchange rates, but for the time being, our Q3 assumption that there will be no change.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: No change, okay. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Good morning guys. If we could shift to Latin America, Mexico first if I could, revenues were down. We all know what’s kind of going on in Mexico, you have won some projects, you mentioned you had some rigs down in the IPM project in the south. Can you kind of walk us through the next 18 months of what you expect to see happen in Mexico?
Paal Kibsgaard: 18 months is a long time, Jim. But let’s start off with H2, so we see activity picking up in the second half of the year and that’s going to be primarily in marine, but also in the north. We have had in addition to the mega-tender also several service contract wins in marine and in the south, which is going to give us further market share gains. So, this year is still impacted by the budget constraints of Pemex. So as we work through that, we still see growth in the second half of the year, but I believe most of these budget constraints as well as the rig shutdowns will be sorted out over the next one to two quarters. So, while I expect growth in the second half of the year, I am still a lot more optimistic about 2015 and hope that we can get back on track to have a really good year, next year in Mexico.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Through 2015 covers my 18 months, I appreciate that. Now, can you do the same thing for me for Brazil considering the drilling contractors now being re-tendered, do we expect that really to switch over at the end of the year? And what’s the implication for your idle equipment in Brazil if that happens?
Paal Kibsgaard: First of all, we don’t have any idle equipment in Brazil. We don’t hold idle equipment around in various countries. If it is idle, we put it into the pool and put it to use. But in Brazil, this year is obviously significantly down both due to pricing and significantly lower activity. There might be some uptick in 2015, but I am not as optimistic on the improvement in 2015 in Brazil as I am in Mexico. I think we will see improvements in activity partly due to the drilling activity surrounding around 11 exploration awards, which is going to start for some of the IOCs in 2015. And there could also be a chance that Petrobras will increase some of their activity, but I am a bit more guarded on how great 2015 will be in Brazil until these two contracts that are now tendered, I expect them to be quite competitive to bid again, I don’t think there is going to be any dramatic change to that now. We will see what happens.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Becker from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. I want to circle back on North America, first quarter was impacted by weather, we saw second quarter impacted by some of the supply chain sand labor issues. Just any quantification in terms of what type of impact we have here that would be outside the norm?
Paal Kibsgaard: I can’t give you that like I reviewed in the – I think the first question from Ole, there is a lot of moving parts from our supply chain, has some impact, but there is a lot of other moving parts that I just reviewed. So, I can’t break it down for you, but with all the moving parts, 53 basis points down isn’t dramatic. And we are quite confident that we can improve margins going forward from this point.
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Sure. Maybe just order of impact between supply chain sand labor, just….
Paal Kibsgaard: I am not going to break it down any further.
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just circling back on Latin America, just an update on the mobilization for the mega-tenders, is that on pace to be complete this year or do we actually maybe see some margin improvement in the fourth quarter as that winds down?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, we are on track with mobilization for that. So, a fair bit of the equipment that we needed for those contracts we already had in country. So, at this stage, we are operating 10 rigs across three projects for the mega-tenders. This was probably gradual increase in the second half of the year, but I don’t expect any significant negative margin impact for the mobilization. So, we should see progress from this point.
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thank you. Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Question with regard to international revenue outlook for the second half of the year, first half broadly speaking, we were up about 5% year-over-year, what do you think would be a reasonable expectation for second half on a year-over-year basis?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you correct for Framo, which was counted as revenue in H1 of last year and obviously now as the minority interest in OneSubsea this year, our international revenue was up 7% in H1.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Okay.
Paal Kibsgaard: And we expect that at least to continue in the second half of the year.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Okay. And a similar question, incremental margins were about 75% year-over-year, I mean, stunningly strong, I expect in the moderate for the second half of the year, but I guess the question is I know your target for 2017 on a consolidated basis is 40%, but it just seems to be that the execution is generating considerably stronger incrementals than frankly most seasoned observers have been expecting.
Simon Ayat: Well, was there a question or?
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: I guess the observation and the question is the sustainability, what we are seeing in the first half I mean I am modeling a considerable moderation and that’s what the Street estimates convey and yet you continue to outperform markedly on that front?
Paal Kibsgaard: Fair enough, so H1 like you said I think we are about 65% incremental. So I can give say – it’s fair to say that there might be some moderation in there in the second half of the year. Now we are working very hard on keeping these incrementals up and the strength of our position internationally should allow us to have higher incremental margin spend and obviously what we see in North America. Whether it’s going to go down from the 65%, potentially it should, but we are going to do our best to keep it as high as possible.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on North Americas and outside of the supply chain side you mentioned on-boarding on some of the acquired companies, so if you can just talk about artificial lift business in aggregate I mean a dozen different companies in rod lift, I mean where are you in the continuing of kind of bringing everything to some sort of standardization or giving your manufacturing and operational efficiency where you want to be and what sort of timeline would you think that occurs on?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, it’s a good question. So we are in the early phases of bringing everything together. So we are not looking to integrate each of these 12, 13 companies into one, one completely unified entity, they are working in different basins. They all have their individual setups. But we are looking to consolidate supply chain as much as possible and also take the best practices from the individual companies and try to populate them across all the different companies. So this is going to be done gradually and I still think it’s going to take us probably a good 12 to 18 months to get everything setup exactly the way we want. But these companies are well run. It is a different business that what we have been in the past and we are also partly learning some of these things as we go into it. But I would say it probably will take us at least another 12 months to get this setup up exactly the way we wanted.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: And then you had referred on the last conference call to I mean you have to be in the game in order to change it from a technology standpoint, is there – how should we think about that timeline for introducing new technology in that business, that occurred – does that come post that 12 months period or should we look for some markers here interim?
Paal Kibsgaard: Now what we are gradually doing now is to bring our ESP business closer together to these rod pump companies because we still believe that there is a period of utilization for different type of lift solutions throughout the life of the well. So by having a very good footprint when it comes to rod pump market share, it should be easier for us to penetrate this market in the early phase of the wells before you put the rod pump on the well with our ESP. So the first step in getting more technology into this is to increase the penetration of ESPs on that rod pump footprint.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Thank you very much, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Paal maybe in some comments out of some major operators in the Norwegian area about maybe relooking at their capital spending what’s your outlook for Norway for the second half and maybe more also in the ‘15 – into the ’15?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you focus on H2, I mean for the summer months we expect a normal impact from the rig maintenance both in the UK and Norway. But as of now we have a solid activity outlook for the remaining part of the year in Norway. We have some good contract wins recently. There is some other work that is out for bid that will probably be awarded relatively soon. Some of these contracts are key for us. So we are hopeful that we will be successful in winning them. So I think overall, I am positive on the activity outlook for Norway for the second half of the year.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then I am curious there are some important drilling going on, are there any discussions going on regarding anything follow-up beyond the first well right now or is it too early to have that till we see the results from the first well?
Paal Kibsgaard: You are talking about Russia?
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Yes, that’s right.
Paal Kibsgaard: I don’t know the detail of the specific value you are referring to, but I am aware that there is good activity in the Arctic in the second half of this year. Going into 2015, I don’t have any detailed visibility yet, but there is strong focus on advancing both these exploration and development programs in the Arctic in Russia and we are actively participating in that.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. That’s all I have.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Couple of questions related to seismic please. Obviously, you have laid out your macro view and that’s very helpful, but noted that multi-client sales in the second quarter were particularly soft, I guess, they haven’t been this soft in a few years and I am curious if you can put that into some greater context for us and give us a sense of if that has implications for reviews on the fourth quarter, which is obviously where it’s seasonally strongest generally? And then secondly just perhaps overall for the year, I think you signaled that you expect that seismic to be down for the industry, but I am not as clear if that’s what you expect for yourselves as well or are some things like isometrics and other factors helping you out on a relative basis?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. If we start with multi-client like you said, multi-client revenue in Q2 was weak than we expected at $133 million. This is down 47% year-on-year, which is quite significant. It is not surprising that multi-client revenue falls when there is basically added scrutiny on exploration and seismic spend, but we are now at the lowest level that we have seen since 2009 just following the financial crisis, right, but we manage to absorb that reduction in the second quarter and still deliver on the quarter, which I am pleased with. In terms of the rest of the year, I expect Q3 to be fairly similar to Q2 I don’t expect any significant improvement. There should be a year end effect. It might not be as high as what we saw in 2013, but I still expect there to be a surge towards toward year end, but potentially lower. In terms of the overall outlook for seismic for us, we also expected to be down in terms of overall revenue for this year and is driven then partly by multi-client and also through marine, where we at this stage have gone from 15 vessels at the beginning of the year, down to 13 vessels at the end of Q2. And we plan to reduce also down to 12 vessels in Q4. So, we are doing this to maintain profitability and utilization and we will continue to look at further vessels tax if it’s necessary.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: Thanks. Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: Paal, I wanted to ask you just quickly on your offshore revenue growth outlook here, I mean clearly the offshore revenue component is very important for Schlumberger, just how are you seeing the unfold here versus maybe where you were at the beginning of the year given the fact that we have certainly seen some utilization challenges on the floater side as new capacity has come into the market and certainly you mentioned again the demand waning here on the IOC side. Has there been any material changes as you think about revenue growth here for you, what should the market externally look at, I mean because clearly we see the utilization numbers and we are able to track that, we know day rates have come down significantly. We know you have got share opportunities here that you are gaining, I mean, how do we think about the offshore revenue stream for Schlumberger?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at the international market, so far this year we have seen about 6% growth in rig count on land as well as 6% growth in rig count for the conventional offshore. Deepwater is basically two stories. You have Brazil, which is down about 27% year-to-date, while the rest of the world is also up about 6%, which is similar to the conventionally offshore. So, there is really no change to what we expected going into the year. We had factored into our deepwater plans, some lower utilizations as we were expecting these commercial discussions on rig rates to lead to lower utilization. Some of these discussions have concluded actually quicker than what we thought. Then I think that has the positive impact on the utilization versus what we assumed, but really nothing dramatic. We expected Brazil to be down significantly and the rest of offshore to continue to grow at the solid pace and 6% is we consider that quite good.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: Okay. So the rate of growth really nothing has changed.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: Okay. I appreciate the time. I will turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: Yes. Just a quick follow-up. Simon, can you give us a breakdown of how much of the 16% growth year-on-year North America was organic versus the acquired companies?
Simon Ayat: Well, Michael, we obviously have these numbers, but we are not going to disclose all of these details.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: Okay, thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie from IBERIA Capital. Please go ahead.
Rob MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital: Hey, guys. I guess I got a little bit of a different question for you on the lift business than what you had so far. My question is centered around your view of where that business develops over time, because clearly obviously buying rod lift companies and the dumb iron if you will associated with that is not something that is – something Schlumberger has typically been interested in the past? Is there another angle here we should be looking at namely perhaps making it more of a service delivery business through the life of the field versus just a pure equipment sale business? What’s your vision for where that segment goes?
Paal Kibsgaard: It’s a very good question. So I think there are two things to be said about that. Firstly, I think over time there are things that could be done to advance the technology that is used. Now, I think you will be needing a range of technologies, because the flow rates of these wells, they vary gradually with time. So – but I think there are things that could be done both on the ESP side and on the PCP rod lift side, which we are working on. So, that’s on the technology itself. But the other part is the business model like you allude to. And our view of this for the future would be that we potentially ultimately can sell lift. So, we will take on the well and we will basically have a business model, where we are paid on production for off time and our ability to maximize production through the optimal lift solution for the well. So, that is our view on the future. That’s why we are getting into this. And again changing, changing the game will have to be done from within. Rod pumps are going to be key in this based on the installed base in North America land, but I think there is opportunity to optimize the technology and there is also a very good opportunity to potentially change the business model over time. 
Rob MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital: Great. How would you help us thinking about how that trajectory looks, how long it takes, pace of adoption and so on an so forth?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, it’s a bit difficult to predict on that, Rob. What we are focusing on now is to basically consolidate all these companies that we have both, gain a further understanding of the market and get closer to this part of our customer base, which we haven’t worked on – worked with closely in the past. And I think as we do that and establish ourselves as a credible player in this market, which I think we can do relatively quickly, I think our chances of starting to change this business model say over the next one to two years should be there.
Rob MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital: Great, thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. That’s all the time we have for questions today. Now, on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today’s call. Greg, will you now please provide the closing comments?

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant: Thank you, Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2014 results conference call. Today’s call is being hosted from Abu Dhabi, where Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place earlier today. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I’d like to remind participants that some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.21. This is $0.14 lower sequentially but $0.24 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, during the second quarter of last year, we wind down our operations in Iran and classified the results of the business as a discontinued operation and all the prior period amounts have restated. Oilfield Services first quarter revenue of $11.2 billion decreased 5.6% sequentially, while the pre-tax operating margins declined 18 basis points. Approximately half of the $667 million sequential revenue decrease was a result of the absence of the year end surge in the product software and multi-client sales that we experienced last quarter. The remainder of the decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal weather related slowdowns that typically experience in Q1. These factors also accounted for the sequential decline in margins. Given the significant impact that these seasonal factors had on our sequential performance, my comments will focus on year-on-year changes unless otherwise noted. Oilfield Services revenue increase 6.3% year-on-year, while pre-tax operating margins grew by 248 basis points. Highlight by product group were as follows. Reservoir characterization revenue of $2.9 billion increased 1.8% while margins grew by 129 basis points to 27.3%. These increases were -- are primarily attributable to a very strong performance in wire line on improved offshore exploration activity. Drilling group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 6.6% and margin improved by 249 basis points to 20.3%. These improvements were due to increased technology integration and robust drilling measurement and M-I SWACO activities in the Middle East and Asia.  Production group of $4.1 billion increased 9.5%, while margin grew by 313 basis points to 17.9%. This growth was driven primarily by a very strong performance by well services in North America land despite the severe weather. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and the credits was 22.6% in the first quarter compared to 22.3% in the previous quarter. We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. Net debt increased $610 million during the quarter to $5.1 billion, reflecting the consumption of working capital that we typically experienced during Q1. Driven by the annual payments associated which increased compensation. At 18% of last 12 month revenue, working capital was lower in both absolute terms as well as percentage against the same quarter of last year. Additionally, we spent $899 on our stock buyback program during Q1. We repurchased almost 10 million shares at an average price of $90.31 during the quarter. As you know, back in July of last year, our vote approved new $10 billion share repurchase program. To-date we have repurchased $2.6 billion of shares under this program. During the quarter we spent $864 million on CapEx. We generated $688 million of free cash flow compared to $127 million in the same period last year. As it relates to full-year 2014, CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013. And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. In spite of severe winter weather impacting activity in our Russia, China, and North America land operations, our first quarter results were solid and fully in line with our expectations. Sequentially revenue dipped from the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal slowdown in activity and lower product and multi-client seismic sales, but grew year over year by just north of 6% while pretax operating income increased by 21% to yield an incremental margin of 60%.  The driving force behind these results is further market share gains on the back of growing new technology sales and expanding integration related activity as well as a relentless focus on operational excellence and efficiency. In terms of revenue progression by customer group, our year-over-year growth was driven by the NOCs and the independents which now represent more than 70% of our revenue, while overall activity for the IOCs was more or less flat. In the first quarter we generated close to $700 million of free cash flow which is an improvement of almost $550 million compared to the same quarter last year. Based on the growing strength of our free cash flow, we have decided to accelerate our current $10 billion stock buyback program announced in July of last year with the aim of completing the program in two and half years versus the original target of five years.  This does not change how we intent to use our cash where the priority continues to be reinvestment in the business to drive growth while we remain opportunistic when it comes to M&A and also plan to renew dividend levels each year. The acceleration of the buyback program is more a reflection of the confidence we have in our business performance and outlook and a signal of our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Our international business continued to perform well in the first quarter. The seasonal impact of weather and lower product sales resulted in a sequential drop in revenue of 8%. However pre-tax operating margins were resilient at 22.8%, down only 73 basis points from the fourth quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, revenue was up 5% on the back of strong growth in the Middle East and Asia while pretax operating margins expanded by 286 basis points driven by new technology sales and strong focus on cost and resource management.  In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive and we have not seeing any signs of a general pricing inflection. However our latest technology and our best in class service quality continued to carry a premium which together with the growth in integration related activity is reflected in our revenue rated pricing indicator which is up compared to the first quarter of last year. The improvement in effective pricing together with our ongoing transformation programs focused on reliability and efficiency puts us in a very competitive position in the international markets which we are using to drive both market share gains and to expand our margins. In Latin America, revenue was down 12% sequentially while operating margins were essentially flat at 21.1%. Compared to the same quarter last year revenue was down 8% however pretax operating income was flat due to proactive cost and resource management and also supported by our broad and diverse contract base in the region.  The year over year reduction in revenue was predominantly driven by Brazil, where both activity and pricing were significantly down compared to last year. Still, introduction of new technology and swift actions to right size the resource base in the country has enabled us to minimize the negative financial impact from the lower activity.  In Mexico, revenue was also down compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by lower budget spend from Pemex, both on land and offshore. The Pemex, mega tender process was concluded during the quarter and we have signed contracts worth $1.9 billion, which represents nearly half of the awarded work scope covering all the major projects in the South and North regions. The resource mobilization for the additional project is ongoing and will be concluded during the second and third quarter as we gradually ramp up the activity. In Argentina, year-over-year growth was strong driven by rig-based activity in the Vaca Muerta shale where we are also actively engaging with a number of customers on sub-surface studies and on projects to improve drilling and completion efficiency. In Venezuela, activity was also up year-over-year and we continue to work closely with PdVSA to help them grow production and improve operational efficiency.  And in Ecuador we posted strong growth compared to the first quarter of last year, as we continue to progress on the Shushufindi SPM project where we again set the new production record during the quarter.  We also secured a right to negotiate for two additional blocks of fields in the country in the latest production in [indiscernible] that took place in the first quarter and these commercial discussions have already started. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 3% sequentially while operating margins were essentially flat at 26.3%. On a year over year basis, revenue increased 19% and margins were up by 349 basis points. In the Middle East, year over year growth was again driven by Saudi Arabia where we continue to move in resources to keep pace with the additional growth we are taking on, and also by the United Arab Emirates where activity is at a record high.  In Southern Iraq, activity was down significantly compared to the same quarter last year as contract awards are delayed due to ongoing discussions between the IOCs and the governments. Based on this as well as the upcoming elections, we do not expect any significant recovery in activity in Southern Iraq in the coming quarters, and we are therefore already taking actions to right size our resource base. Activity in Northern Iraq on the other hand was solid in the first quarter and we expect strong growth there in 2014 leaving full year revenue for the country flat with 2013 and the operating margins approaching the average of the region. Southeast Asia posted strong first quarter results driven by high deepwater activity throughout the region, solid SPM performance in Malaysia and very good drilling performance in our IPM project in Queensland, Australia. In China we continue to ramp up activity on our tight gas SPM project with Yanchang Petroleum in the Ordos basin and we are operating a total of 12 rigs at the end of the first quarter. In Europe, C.I.S. and Africa, revenue was down 11% sequentially and operating margins were down by 220 basis points. However compared to the same quarter last year when the majority of the [formal] (ph) activity was still included in our ECA numbers, revenue grew by 1% and margins were up by 253 basis points. The year over year revenue growth in the region was also negatively impacted by severe winter weather in Russia as well as the weakening of the ruble that took place during the quarter. Still, the underlying activity both offshore and on land in Russia remains firm for the year. There were also several positive activity signs in parts of Europe and Africa that helped offset the first quarter headwinds in Russia. In Norway we posted solid year over year growth driven by market share gains for our drilling services and we expect to see further growth in the second quarter as the seismic season starts and wherever this year will have particular focus on the [balance sheet] (ph). We have also been awarded a five year integrated well construction contract by the Norske for exploration and drilling activity where we will play an integral part of both the planning and execution process. And in West Africa we also posted strong year over year growth driven by both exploration and development work in several of the Gulf of Guinea countries and we still expect strong growth in 2014 in the region in particular from Angola, Gabon and Chad. In North America we posted a strong quarter with revenue up 1% sequentially while margins were down 107 basis points to 18.5% driven by pricing pressure and severe winter weather on land as well as drilling delays in the Gulf of Mexico. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew 12% while margins were down 53 basis points.  On land, we posted strong year over year growth in revenue driven by market share gains and new technology uptick in pressure pumping as well as solid growth in our artificial lift business where we continue to expand our market position in the rod lift market. Our margins on land were impacted by lower pricing in pressure pumping as we rolled over several key contracts at the end of last year and we also choose to incur additional sand transportation and fuel costs during the periods of severe winter weather to avoid any disruption to our customers’ operations. In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater drilling activity was down compared to the first quarter of last year due to a series of operational delays, longer completion times and more work over activity and this impacted several of our product lines. However, the situation is expected to normalize again in the second quarter and the outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year. Turning to technology, in 2013, we saw further growth in the rate of high impact commercializations from our RNE organization. This, together with significant improvements and the out of box performance of our new products had a clear impact on our financial results as presented in last month’s Howard Weil conference in New Orleans. In 2014 we expect this trend to continue with a wide range of new technologies scheduled for introduction to the market at the rates that will even surpass 2013. We will showcase a number of these new technologies in our investor events that will take place June 24th and 25th in New York. In addition to the latest technologies from reservoir characterization and drilling, we will present a range of new production related technologies including a revolutionary intelligent completion system, our latest multistage completion technology and new fracturing fluid innovation and we will give you an update on our North American land artificial lift business where we see strong growth potential for both ESP and rod pump sales sales. Together with these technology presentations we will review progress on our ongoing transformation programs and also provide an updated financial outlook for the coming three year period. Moving on to the macro picture, the global economic data has been mixed so far this year, with the US suffering an unusually half winter, China showing some signs of slowdown, although still projected to grow along 7.5% in 2014 and the situation in Ukraine adding a new risk to the outlook. However, the fundamentals of the global recovery remain intact, as the above factors are likely to only have a temporary impact. In contrast to this, the oil markets have been significantly tighter than anticipated, as strong demand trends in OECD and in the Middle East together with continuing supply disruptions in various regions have left to lower spare capacity figures and pushed OECD stocks down to the largest deviation from historical averages since 2003. The North American supply search continues to be just enough to equal the world's growing demand, while all other growth regions, including Iraq, Brazil and the Caspian are struggling to meet their production targets. This should continue to support oil prices around $100 a barrel and therefore encourage oil directed investments in both the North American and International markets. U.S. natural gas demand reached a new all-time record in Q1, due to the severe winter weather pushing prices to a six year high. However, U.S. supply trends remain strong on the back of the Marcellus and as the weather normalizes over the springs and summer months we expect the North American market to return to a balanced supply demand situation from natural gas. International gas markets remain relatively tight largely driven by Chinese demand which continues to grow at double digit rates while European gas demand has eased in the past months on a mild winter. Based on these markets conditions, we continue to expect well related EMP spend to grow by more than 6% in 2014, with spend growth relatively balanced between North America and the international markets. We further expect our year-over-year growth in 2014 to be driven by the NOC’s and the independents. After several years of strong growth, our revenue IOCs has dropped over the past two quarters and was in Q1 flat compared to the same quarter last year. However, the first quarter should be the low point for IOC revenue this year, as our latest activity outlook indicates sequential revenue growth from this customer group in the coming quarters and with full year revenue expected to be flat with 2013. Equally important to the level EMP spend and the way we translate this into revenue it’s our ability to convert the top line growth into profits. While we plan to deliver a solid incremental margin on the challenging market conditions in North America, we see potential for higher levels in our international business as demonstrated by our first quarter year-over-year incremental margins of 86%. We are not likely to maintain these levels to our 2014, but our international incremental margin potential should offer strong support to our earnings growth in the coming year. Furthermore, our broad geographical footprints, our balanced technology portfolio and our agile organization provides us with insulation from market downsides as recently seen in Latin America and allows us to swiftly capitalize on market opportunities, whether in North America or anywhere else in the growth. We therefore remain positive and optimistic with respect to the 2014 outlook as we continue to aim for solid double digit growth in earnings per share, fueled by a combination of topline growth, margin expansion and the acceleration of our current stock buyback program. That concludes my remarks, we will now open up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). First question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning, Paal. I was wondering if you could expand a bit on your comments with the IOC’s, so 30% business it looks kind of flat, obviously we have seen a lot of headlines of the IOCs cutting CapEx, I was wondering if you could put that into context first a little bit? Can you help us understand how you see it's progressing, is it simply a function of day rates and when day rates come down, the projects start moving ahead. I was just wondering if you can help us how you see that kind of progressing throughout the year.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So let me first start one thing, so I said that the IOCs are now making up well below 30%. So it has dropped over the past couple of quarters. So we have already seen a reduction in their spend. And what we’re saying is that, it’s already flat now year-over-year, the forecast we have from the value, geomarkets and a roll-up indicates our progression in the next couple of quarters and we see the full year basically being flat year-over-year.  Now what’s driving that, as we said before, we believe that the primary focus of the CapEx cuts from the IOCs will be on projects that are heavy on infrastructure and probably less so on well rated CapEx, although we have seen some impact on this as well.  
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Okay, so if I think about kind of the exploration spend side of that, I guess that’s the part that I wonder the most about. It seems like that might be a little bit more at risk than say, the development CapEx. Can you talk about that from that standpoint, and how that could impact the WesternGeco, because obviously you guys have more exploration risk, so just kind of help us, kind of quantify. Is that a risk for you going forward this year or are you seeing, are you feeling pretty good about that exploration spend even with these kind of chatter-bumpy cuts out there? 
Paal Kibsgaard: We haven’t really changed our view on exploration spend or the seismic spends since the January call. We still expect to see growth in exploration spend in 2014. It’s going to be lower than 2013, and within the exploration spend, we see flattening or flat seismic spend and the growth is going to come through well related spend, through appraisal and exploration type of drilling. So we haven’t really changed the view on either exploration or seismic from the January call. That was already factored into the plan.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays; please go ahead. 
James West - Barclays Capital: Why don’t you just step into North America for a second, clearly the rig count trends have been a little bit better than I think most people anticipated early in the year. How do you see the progress for your business in North America going forward? Is it more that you’re going to gain margin and share from technology or do you actually see some pricing power developing?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at Q1 first of all, in terms of our performance we saw very strong year-over-year growth as I said, with revenue of 12%. And this is a combination of market share gains and new technology uptake. And we continue to gain share and pressure pumping. And this is on the back of efficiency gains and new technology uptake. And we added another two fleets in Q1 from our idle asset program.  Now in terms of activity outlook for North America, on land we expect solid activity growth in U.S. land in 2014. We see this being led by South and West Texas. And in addition to the number of wells, we also see supported by again efficiency gains and further uptake of new technology.  In terms of Canada, the breakup is going to have the normal impact on Q2 and we see Canada slightly up compared to 2013.  And Gulf of Mexico, again Q1 was slow for us because of lower deepwater drilling activity. We see this coming back in Q2 and onwards; so a strong outlook again for Gulf of Mexico.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay, so you do it in the Gulf, but this was I think a little or so deepwater rigs scattered into the Gulf from the second half of this year, you do see all those rigs coming and going to work and see the big uptake in the second half of this year. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, we do. And also the number of rigs in Q1 wasn’t really the problem. They -- we regenerate less revenue, although we have completion work there, the amount of revenue per day in completion mode versus full drilling mode is obviously a significant relapse. So it was not a rig count issue, it was an activity type of issue in Q1.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley; please go ahead. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  Paal, I’m just taking one step back at the -- and I want to just have you clarify a little bit a high level question. You mentioned that the oil markets are tighter than one's anticipated. I know you don’t like talking about client production or anything like that, but once you made a statement I feel like I can ask you to elaborate a little bit more on that. I think consensus have probably been more divided on where oil prices are going and this year, and next year are meant to be the big sort of surge in production [indiscernible] that actually highlighted Brazil, Iraq, Caspian and of course North America. So what is that you see here that you don’t think the other -- or that’s positive to make that statement?
Paal Kibsgaard: Ole I think if you want to build a very kind of bullish case on production, I am sure you can do that. It’s just that if you go back and look at the previous years, there is always an element of project delays and production disruption. And what we said in January is that we expect there to be a normal dose of that in 2014. And so far this year we have seen that, so the market is still relatively tight. Obviously these stocks are down. OpEx spare capacity is down. And there is nothing dramatic in it other than that all the things aren’t lining up as maybe the bull case was at the beginning of the year for production.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Will you tie that to what you see at the customer level of increased project delays now with IOCs being more capital disciplined, or taking a step back here having to borrow for their dividends? Is this something that you think is permanently delayed? How have you changed your view on it, say 2017, let’s say longer term supply growth as a function of what’s going on at a CapEx level at the moment?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think what’s going to happen at least over the next couple of years is that the IOCs will focus more of their spend where they can drill wells and generate production from existing infrastructure or from infrastructure that costs less. So huge infrastructure projects, I would expect to be kind of lower in frequency. And some of them might be postponed as we have already seen. While the focus, again is going to be on generating production which generates cash. So the ability to do that at the lowest possible investment, I think is going to be the focus, which is still good for us.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So does that mean that you’re more than positive on the areas like the North Sea, let’s say metro areas, Gulf of Mexico than what you will be on frontier exploration like Arctic, Russia or [indiscernible]?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I think for the frontier areas, you will still see exploration I think there is still a push towards delineating and trying to assess what these frontiers contain. So I think although there is lower growth in exploration this year I still think there is going to be lot of interest to try to assess what kind of potential these areas have. Now how the economics of the project was stack up and when development starts, that will I think is going to be a function of what they find and what the economics look like. But I still think there will be a push towards doing exploration in frontier areas, yes.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: And finally back to the U.S. again you have the very impressive growth, you highlight that this was market share gains through new technology. Could you kind of help us understand a little bit now how much was market share gains on your technology and how much did the underlying market grow by in your view?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at the overall rig counts, it was up about 4.5% year over year and I would say partly offsetting that growth also was inefficiencies due to the weather. So a fair bit of this I think for us is market share as well as new technology. So I am not going to give you a detailed number which I am sure you know. But I am quite pleased with how we are continuing to progress in particular, in the pressure pumping market. We added about four fleets in Q3, one fleet in Q4 and another two fleets in the first quarter of this year. And this is all at descent incremental margins, so we are pleased with how we are progressing.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Anything on the technology side you can share or do you want to wait to do it?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I already said a lot more about them what we normally do, so I think that’s going to be it.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Good afternoon, Paal where you are, good morning where we are. I have a follow up question, you addressed a lot of the concerns that investors have had with respect to the outlook on IOC spend and so on in great detail, so thanks for that. Question I would have would be, how do you risk assess from this point forward, right. You put out your targets, you kind of took a look at what’s going on with the offshore elements, it looks like the offshore rig market is still kind of on a slide downward. So from this point forward Paal, if you were to look at the offshore market, how would you risk assess it from here. What do you is the biggest driver? Is it more, what’s the risk on activities really what I’m trying to ask you from your standpoint. Is it Brazil; is it outside of Brazil, where -- how do you see that dynamic spinning up?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well if you focus in on deepwater where I think the biggest discussion has been, this is where the biggest projects are and this is where the biggest discussion are on rig rates all right. We looked at this in detail and if you look at the deepwater market, it’s really two separate stories, you have Brazil and you have the rest of the world. In 2013, Brazil represented around 30% of the global deepwater drilling activity and in Q1 of 2014 Brazil was 20% down in activity while the rest of the world was up 3%. Now for the full year of 2014, we expect Brazil to be down more than 20% versus last year, while the rest of the world we see as being up high single digits. And as we previously indicated in January, the growth in the rest of the world deepwater is going to be driven by sub-Sahara Africa and Gulf of Mexico, so really no change to that. And we also see descent growth in both exploration as well as development for deepwater.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: And then if you take that information Paal, when you roll that up into your outlook from a total international revenue growth standpoint, how should we think about that, is that kind of mid-single digit or double digit still double digit growth, how would you look at the international revenue dynamic for the year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well if you look at the activity outlook or revenue outlook for us in the international markets, again we see well rated CapEx spend growing north of 6% and it’s going to again be driven by both land and offshore. There are a few offsetting factors versus what we said in January, so if you quickly go through those, we do see solid growth in deepwater drilling activity excluding Brazil. In Latin America specifically, we now see this as being flat driven by lower revenue in particular in Brazil but also to a certain extent in Mexico. In Europe and Africa, we are still showing good growth and basically in line with the previous outlook. In Russia, the activity outlook is unchanged but the revenue will potentially be lower due to the currently weaker ruble, so what’s going to happen with the ruble as the year progresses we’ll have to see, but if it stays where it is now then revenue is going to be somewhat lower than what we initially expected while activity is the same. Now Middle East and Asia is stronger than we initially expected and that’s driven by several countries in the Middle East as well as Australia. So that’s kind of how we see overall international.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Great. And then one last follow up, one of the key drivers for the margin performance and earnings performance over the last couple of years has been this internal dynamic for technology and excellence and execution and everything else. As you look out at the North American market going forward, you’ve now established firm leadership versus your peer group. Do you expect the excellence and execution program in technology if your peer group were to grow margins by 100 or 200 basis points, is that’s something that you think you can keep pace with or exceed given the dynamics in play right now.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, like you say we've outperformed our competitors in terms of both topline growth in margin evolution [indiscernible] since like mid-2012. So at this stage I am quite pleased with our position both on land and offshore in North America. So we expect to maintain our margin leadership and at the same time grow faster in revenues. So if our competitors can grow by 100 and 200 basis points, I don’t see why we cannot do the same or exceed it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thanks. Good morning. Paal so at a recent industry gathering, you offered some interesting commentary about industry challenges and you referenced the fact that E&P CapEx over the last 10 years have grown by 400% or as oil production was only 15%. And you mentioned the fact, that in the E&P value chain, the oil companies were the ultimate integrators of all the technical work associated with finding hydrocarbons and the collective oil services, community was accountable for not delivering on required performance progress. And you also mentioned that the required improvement was not going to come from yet another round of procurement driven price reductions across the E&P value chain. So along those lines, as the industry is in introspective mood with where the IOCs and deepwater [indices] (ph) in terms of getting their deepwater cost and alignment, apart from the mix shift from infrastructure to well CapEx, what structural reforms are clients contemplating, implementing and the discussions you’re having with your clients along those lines?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think if you look at the short term actions they are taking today, they are looking at bringing the deepwater rig rates down. I mean, if you look at what’s happened on deepwater day rates over the past three, four, five years they have increased significantly and they have been completed disconnected from the other deepwater oilfield services, right. So today the rig rental makes up around 50% of the deepwater well cost, so customers have really been looking for the opportunity to get the rig rental rates down and the opportunity is here in form of the high number of new arrivals, all contract expiring and a significant reduction activity in Brazil. So I think this is the opportunity. In the short term they are trying to get some relief on cost.  Now my comments in terms of a procurement driven exercise across the industry, is more focused in on, we need to basically drive off the technical performance as an industry, whether that is process efficiency or reliability of the projects that we execute. So what some of my customers are doing is they are, they are approaching us a lot more than in the past in terms of doing fully integrated projects, where we are a lot more engaged in the upfront planning and the sign of the work. And where we have a more performance based contracts in terms of how we execute the work as well. So these are some of the short terms actions that they are taking. And I think beyond that I think the service industry needs to take responsibility in terms of finding way of transforming themselves to drive both their internal efficiencies and their technical performance versus the customers that is how we can create more value and support our customers.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Okay. And secondly, coming out of the last quarter, you offered some helpful, I guess, parameters for the first quarter earnings possibilities. Do you have just a high level broad commentary with regard to what we should be focused on with regard to second quarter earnings possibilities?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at Q2, we should see seasonal recovery in Russia and China and also less weather impact in U.S. land. Now this is going to be partially offset by the normal spring break up in Canada which has already started. And beyond this we are expecting steady growth in the underlying business as per the other discussions we’ve had so far today. So our aim for the second quarter is to bring Q2 EPS back to the level of Q4 of last year. That is for us a good target.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Good morning. And Bill Herbert, thank you for asking the question. And all thank you for the answer on the integrated projects. Let me carry that on, you mentioned several times in the press release about integrated projects, their accretion to margins. Can you talk about performance related contracts and what those returns look like relative to the rest of your business?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, in general, Jim, the performance based contracts are accreted to our margins. So we take on performance based contracts where we have a pretty good handle on the environment that we operate in. We have a very good handle on how our customers are operating and are interfacing and supporting our operations. And also what kind of controls we have to drive performance. So I would say in general our performance based contracts and a lot of them are within the drilling group, if you take away the production incentive contracts, they are generally accretive to our margins and if you look at the drilling group margin evolution over the past two, three years, you see a very steady improvement from the time we took over Smith in back in 2010.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you for that. My follow-up question is, your self-help efforts, your transformational efforts internally, those mean a lot and they’re structural and they last for a long time. Which markets do you see those efforts having the biggest impact in over the next two to three years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think they will have impacts globally. We piloted some of these things in North America when we did the initial restructuring of North America land back in when we started in 2010 and that’s being some of the basis for our improvements in North America over the past three-four years. But what we are doing is now starting to pilot in small scale in various other parts of the world and this is going to take several years before we get fully implemented. But at the end of the day, the transformation programs that I’ve been talking about publicly over the past year, will impact all parts of the company, both geographically and in terms of technology.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Okay. And if I could, when we look at the globe of the world, what area, what region do you think has the best upside to margins over the next two to three years?
Paal Kibsgaard: It’s difficult to think, but I would say that -- as I said in my prepared remarks, if you look at incremental margins, we are going to focus in on driving incremental margins throughout our business. With some of the, I would say challenges in particularly in North America land with that we’ve been facing on pricing, it is still more difficult to drive very high incremental margins in North America although we are going to try, but the overall international markets I still think has a significant incremental margin potential and as I also mentioned, year over year Q1 we had 86% incremental margins in international.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities: Thank you. Paal, if well based CapEx is up 6% globally, is that an environment that you can grow your revenues in double digits?
Paal Kibsgaard: It’s a difficult question to answer. I mean is it possible? Yes. Are we going to get to double digits? I can’t really say and I wouldn’t commit to it. But the fact that we have the potential of growing our revenues higher than the 6% is I think is very clear.
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities: Okay. Second question Paal is getting back to North American pricing for today’s technology, not newer technology, but is the 6% increase in well based CapEx in the U.S. in 2014 sufficient to drive pricing anywhere in the U.S. in any product lines for again today’s technology?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think overall I don’t think 6% is going to be sufficient to have a wide spread price increase in commodity type of technologies. Now you might have small pockets where there is a surge of activity and there is insufficient capacity to deliver. You might have situations where new technologies are introduced or where efficiencies are stepped up, where you can drive your effective pricing. But at this stage I would say that we are expecting North America land pricing overall, we are hoping it’s going to flatten from where it is now, that’s going to be the forecast I would say that we have going forward and then we are looking on top of that to drive up our effective pricing through a new technology introduction and by driving efficiency of our operations.
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities: Okay, good answer. And then last question, Paal you talked about Brazil, what is the risk in your opinion of continued slides in activity in Brazil throughout this year and even into 2015? It seems like every rig that’s coming off contract they’re releasing.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, so as already said, I think Brazil activity, Brazil revenue for us this year is going to be significantly down versus 2013, it’s a combination of both activity as you say as well as the pricing on the new contracts that we took on during 2013. So there is no surprise that Brazil revenue is going to be down significantly and that’s already factored into these discussions and the outlook that I’ve been giving today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Paal, you mentioned before China there was some weakness in the quarter. Where do you see the outlook? Is this temporary and then what’s going on there for the year and beyond?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we still expect solid growth in China in 2014. It’s going to be a bit lower than 2013 partly due to some of these budget reductions that we have seen from the NOCs. But our focus in the China land market is very much on penetrating it further and if you look at our overall penetration of that market it is still very low. So, we aren’t immediately impacted significantly by these budget reductions. We are seeing significantly high demand for our new technology, for our technical expertise and also for project management. So that’s why we are still quite optimistic about China. And growth is going to be driven by land both in terms of conventional type gas and shale gas, and offshore is also going to continue to be solid. So I would say solid growth in 2014, a bit lower than 2013.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then in the Middle East it seems to be pretty active area, as you mentioned. Is there a way to quantify what kind of revenue growth could be possible from the Middle Eastern areas, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, that area? 
Paal Kibsgaard: It is vague. Yes, and we have done it. But I’m not going to share the outlook with you in great detail, other than we see it -- we saw it as a major growth driver for 2014 and it has confirmed its potential and it might even be slightly up in April versus where we thought it would be in January.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So could it be in the upper teens growth rate there or mid teen growth rates, in that kind of range? 
Paal Kibsgaard:  I’m not going to give you a number. You can look at the Q1 year-over-year number which was pretty solid.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil; please go ahead. 
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: Thanks, good morning. Paal, I found your comments on the southern Iraq interesting. I know Iraq had been one of the five countries I think you had outlined previously as kind of the highest growth markets for you. Has there been any change in terms of your thought on Iraq in general here in how the proceeds for Schlumberger, as going forward and maybe just on a year-over-year basis?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, for 2014 the main change has been that the activity in the south is going to be down. And this is mainly driven by ongoing discussions between the IOCs and the Ministry. There are things that they need to sort out and agree upon before they will move forward and award some of these lump-sum turnkey contracts that are pending. So until that happens, there isn’t going to be a lot of work awarded in the south. And with the upcoming elections, we don’t think that that situation and these bids are going to be awarded in the next couple of quarters. We think that is probably a late year event before it happens.  So that’s why activity in Southern Iraq for this year is going to be down. Now offsetting this is very strong activity growth in Northern Iraq. And here we have an excellent market position. It’s a lot focused on high-end exploration and we are able to offset the reduced activity in revenue in the South with growth in the North. So that 2014 Iraq revenue is going to be flat year-over-year and the margins are also now quickly approaching the average for the region. So overall, it’s somewhat downgrading of the growth in Iraq, but both margins and as well as the offsetting factor of the North is positive.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: My follow-up would be, I know you said sometime, talking about the topline expectations in Latin America and the headwinds in Brazil. Your commentary on Mexico, I think is least as we start to think about the exiting 2014 on a year-over-year basis seemed more positive. Just thoughts there in terms of when you perhaps see year-over-year growth in Mexico or I guess number one, my follow-up to it will be just on the margins in Latin America. You’ve done a pretty good job of holding those relatively flat. Perhaps I missed it, but I don’t think I heard any thoughts on the kind of margin growth we should expect that to move forward here in Latin America or just is relatively flat a good expectation?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I think overall for Latin America, I think flat is a good word. I think we see overall revenue to be flattish this year. And we are going to work very hard on maintaining our margins around the levels that we had in 2013. So far this year that's worked out well. And we will continue to focus in on that.  So, obviously a significant negative on Brazil which we already talked about. Mexico is more of a positive story. But in the short-term here what we see is a lot more budget discipline from Pemex; and also a little bit more hesitance towards spend as this ongoing reform proceeds. But as you know, we had some significant wins in the mega tenders, where we have gained significant shares and we will be ramping up activity in Q2 and into H2. So we expect to be exiting Mexico this year on a pretty good note and that will be a good driver for us in 2015.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Bernstein; please go ahead.  
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein: Paal, can you talk about your strategy in North American and rod lift? You see a path to transform legacy products through technology development or is there any interest in the space largely based on a view of end-market growth?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, so we are interested in North America land artificial lift markets, and we have followed it for some time. There is clearly significant growth potential there. It’s a huge market. There are hundreds of thousands of wells that installed rod lifts and we see a significant opportunity to apply more science and technology into this markets and also to help drive production and cost per barrel. So, if you want to be part of transforming a market which obviously are ultimate goal this year, and transforming it to the benefit of our customers, we are firm believers that you have to play in it; you cannot change it from the side lines. So while we have a growing ESP business in the North America land for the, shale liquid wells, we also believe that we need to have a complete offering and what we are looking to do now is to combine our ESP offering with these rod lift companies that we have both over the recent quarters. And then ultimately provide a life of well lift solution to our customer base. And that could be ESP for part of the life and it could be a rod pump for the other part of the life. So we are working on this and we will give a further off take on this business both I would say further strategy as well as technology in our June investor event.
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein: Great. In an unrelated follow-up in Russia, Rosneft appears to be taking a new strategy toward contracting rigs. Have you noticed a change in how they cooperate with the service companies? Are they starting to push back on pricing for any of your services?
Paal Kibsgaard: As far as I know, we haven’t had any recent discussions with Rosneft on pricing beyond what is normal for our services. Exactly what Rosneft do in terms of oil contracting rigs, I don’t have any further comments to what their strategy is, no.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Paal I wanted to ask you about Saxon and sort of more strategically Schlumberger in the last few years has been moving away from the more asset intensive segments with the sale of rigs in Russia, and obviously the spark business model in U.S. pumping. Can you -- is something changing with respect to that strategy or was this just an acquisition or consolidation of opportunity?
Paal Kibsgaard: No you’re right. I mean, we continue to focus on return on capital employed and to be, would say capital efficient as we go forward. So there is no change in the strategy here, but let me just give you a little bit of the rationale for why we are acquiring Saxon. So land rigs has always been a key part of our integration platform for well construction.  Now in the past, and what led to the set-up of Saxon where we have basically sold them the rigs, we sold the rigs to Eurasia in Russia as well is that our priority in the past have been basically to have access to rigs from a trusted provider. It’s more a capacity issue that we’ve been focusing in, in the past. What we are doing now is that we are evolving this view to also seeing the land rig as a critical element of how we drive drilling performance. So what we planned to do at this stage now and Saxon is generally focused on the international market where we have basically all of our integration related business. We plan to invest in optimizing rig design and rig operations by combining Saxon’s rig engineering and rig management capabilities with our existing drilling expertise from both IPM and the drilling group. So there are some third party rigs within the Saxon fleet today, it’s quite a few and we will continue to support them, and if there are opportunity to do third party rentals, we will continue to do. But we are predominately buying Saxon because we want to have our own rig provider that we can help, help us drive the performance of our integration business for well construction.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: Very interesting. Thank you. On Venezuela, I know that PdVSA has been working with IOCs and [indiscernible] to try to work with terms and get activity higher to raise production. Can you may be talk about what you see happening in that market over the next year, do you think there will be success there and the 2015 could be a much bigger year in Venezuela potentially?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, for us Venezuela today is actually quite good. Activity in Q1 was solid. It was up more than 20% year over year and as you say, we have a close working relationship with PdVSA and as we put our payment agreement with them in place, payments are regular and they are according to plan. So we are in reasonably good shape there.  So looking forward for this year, we see continued increase in the rig counts. And these addition of rigs are mainly focused in on the [indiscernible] and we continue to ramp up our resources and expertise in the country, right. We have a number of projects with PdVSA where we are working with them to drive operational efficiency and obviously to help them drive up production. So we see Venezuela for 2014 to be one of the positives in Latin America.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Wondering, if you -- you guys have introduced a couple of [leasebacks] (ph) to the U.S. frac market from your stat capacity. I wondered if you could just talk us through how you are thinking about further efficiency gains in your frac fleet here in the U.S. as well as the ability to for the market to absorb incremental capacity for new well this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think the overall activity in terms of new wells and in terms of frac stages is going to be up in 2014. And whether we will add more capacity into this, I think is going to be a function of the pricing and the incremental margins we will get on the addition of fleets that we put in. All the fleets that we have introduced over the past three quarters, these criteria have been met, and that’s why we have been adding them, right. So we are currently today operating at 82% in terms of 24 hour operations, which has been obviously a key driver for efficiency. And other than that we are focusing in on term contracts. So we have about 90% of our pressure pumping contract volume on term. And we do that because we see that as a key element to help drive efficiency. That’s how we get predictable work. And we have a close working relationship with our customers for planning and scheduling. And also having term contracts and longer term relationships other than the spots, also helps us in the way we work together with them in terms of technical collaboration as well as new technology introduction. So, I am reasonably optimistic about our ability to continue to gain share in that market. What’s going to happen to base pricing, I think base pricing as of now we are looking for it to flatten out. 
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Your second question is just around the seismic outlook. I know the backlog can be choppy for that business, but it was up a reasonable amount sequentially to exit Q1, does that -- has that changed at all the Schlumberger outlook for the marine seismic business as the rest of the year plays out? 
Paal Kibsgaard: No, we haven’t changed our outlook for the seismic business since January. So like you said, the backlog was up 196 million sequentially and 49 million year-over-year. This was driven both by land and marine. And in terms of the 2014 outlook for seismic, we maintained the outlook that we did in January, that it’s going to be flattish in terms of overall spend this year. We continue to see pressure on basic marine pricing, we saw that in Q1. But in terms of Q2 and Q3 activity and our bookings and utilization is looking quite reasonable. So we did no change to what we looked at in January. 
Simon Farrant: Okay, that’s all the time we have for questions today. Now on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today’s call. Greg will now provide the closing comments.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. For the conference, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. With that, I will turn the conference now over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead. 
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, John. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full year 2013 results conference call. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I’d like to remind the participants that some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now, I will turn the call over to Simon. 
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.35. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and is $0.31 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded a $0.09 charge relating to a provision of accounts receivable in connection with the client in Brazil who filed for bankruptcy during the quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $11.9 billion increased 2.6% sequentially. Of this $298 million sequential increase, the vast majority came from the year-end surge in software product and multi-client sales that we typically experienced in the Q4. Oilfield Services pre-tax income of $2.6 billion increased 4.3% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margin increased by 37 basis points to 21.9% largely due to the positive effects of the previously mentioned seasonal year-end sales. Sequential revenue and pre-tax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization group revenue of $3.2 billion increased 1% while margin improved 132 basis points to 31.7%. These increases were driven by traditionally strong end of year software and multi-client sales offset in part by the seasonal decline in the WesternGeco Marine activity and the conclusion of several higher margin exploration projects. Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.5 billion increased 1.9% while margin declined by 69 basis points to 19.6%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to robust M-I SWACO and IPM activity in the Middle East and Asia area, while the margin decline was finally due to an over less favorable revenue mix. Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of $4.2 billion increased 4.8% as a result of robust Completion and Artificial Lift product sales and pre-tax margin declined by 27 basis points to 17.3% as the impact of stronger results from our Schlumberger production management projects and end of year product sale was more than offset by continued pricing pressure in U.S. land. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 22.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.7% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $4.4 billion representing an improvement of $1.2 billion as compared to end of Q3. Most notably we spent almost $1.1 billion on our stock buyback program during the quarter. We repurchased 11.9 million shares at an average price of $18.67 during the quarter. In addition during the quarter we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $1.5 billion of 3.65% 10-year notes and €500 million 1.5% 5-year notes. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of approximately $1.2 billion. We were quite pleased with our working capital performance during the quarter. From a cash flow perspective we generated approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operation during all of 2013. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities which we did by completing various acquisitions and investment in other companies most significantly our investment in (indiscernible) and investing $4.3 billion in CapEx and multi-client. While at the same time returning $4.2 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases during the year. During the full year 2013 we repurchased 31.3 million shares at an average price of $82.82. From for a total of $2.6 billion while paying out $1.6 billion in dividend. As it relates to 2014 CapEx is expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013. We expect the EPR for the full year 2014 to be in the low to mid-20s however this can vary on a quarterly basis depending on the geographical mix of earnings. Yesterday our Board of Directors approved a 28% increase in our annual dividend to $1.60 per share. This follows last year’s 15.6% increase and increases of 10% in 2012 and 19% in 2011. This new level of dividend reflects our confidence in our ability to deliver this growth and at the same time generate superior cash flows and return excess cash to our shareholders. And now I turn the conference over to Paal. 
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you Simon. Our fourth quarter results presented a very successful year for Schlumberger was driven by continued growth in the underlying activity as well as strong year end product sales partly offset by the temporary shutdown of our operations in South Iraq in November and we expected seasonal slowdown in our businesses in North America, Russia and China. Fourth quarter multiclient seismic sales were slow in the first two months of the quarter but we saw very strong sales in December driven by high demand for the latest surveys in our library which are based in our unique acquisition and processing technologies. Sequentially overall revenue was up 3% with topline growth posted in all four operating areas while pretax operating margins expanded by 37 basis points to reach 21.9%. Compared to the same quarter last year pretax operating income was up 23%. New technology sales remain strong in all three product groups and this together with further market share gains as well as focused execution and cost control contributed profitably to the quarter’s results. For the third quarter in a row we also posted commendable sequential incremental margins, this time at 36% was generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow boasted by our ongoing efforts to improve asset utilization and reduce consumption of working capital. Our international business progressed well in the fourth quarter with revenues tapping in all time high exceeding $8 billion and representing a year-over-year growth of 8%. At the same time year-over-year margin expanded by 349 basis points to reach 23.5% which is only around 350 basis point compared with the previous quarter peak recorded in Q3 of 2008. Sequentially international revenue was up 3% and margins expanded by 23 basis points. In terms of pricing the international market continues to be highly competitive and we’re not seeing any kinds of a general pricing inflection. Still the current market conditions suit us well as we’re able to drive our effective pricing approach to a strong new technology sales by commanding a premium on our execution capabilities as well as from the growing demand for integrated services. These factors are also reflected in our revenue for pricing indicator which in 2013 improved by 5% over the previous year. In Latin America revenue was up 3% sequentially well margins expanded by 59 basis points to reach 21.2%. Compared to the same quarter last year revenue was down 3% while pretax operating income was up 13% driven by excellent margin improvement in the region inspite of the market headwinds faced in several key countries. The sequential results were driven by strong performance in Ecuador where Shushufindi SPM project continues to exceed expectations. In Argentina where we’re very active with the shale related work in the Wakamoto and by Mexico where we saw strong activity on land. In Mexico where the energy reform was signed in December and we expect the first license grant to be held later 2014 with the earlier impact on our activity in 2015. The early indication from the (indiscernible) which were significant and opened earlier this week are very positive for us suggesting a solid gain in market share. In Venezuela activity was sluggish in the fourth quarter after solid growth in Q3. Our working relationship with PDVSA is excellent and we continue to receive payments in line with the agreement we signed in May last year so we plan to further ramp up activity in the country in 2014. In Brazil the business environment remained difficult with lower activity in the fourth quarter for Petrobras as well as the local independent and the international oil companies. We have adjusted our cost base in the country and are prepared to manage what appears to be a challenging 2014 before activity growth likely resumes in 2015. In the Middle-East and Asia revenue grew 5% sequentially while margins were flat at 26.1%. On a year-over-year basis revenues increased 18% while margins were up by 404 basis points. In the Middle-East sequential growth was driven by Saudi Arabia where we continue to move in resources to keep pace with the additional growth for the last eight month [ph] and by the United Arab Emirates activity is at a record high following our recent contract with them.
 :
 : In the North Sea, we saw expected seasonal impact on activities driven by winter weather and the NW [ph] pricing increasing. While in North America business continues to be challenging due to reach and operational delay and as well as ongoing security challenges. Looking at the 2014 outlook for the Europe and Africa region we still expect growth to be driven by sub-Saharan Africa and to a certain extent the North Sea while we expect the ongoing challenges in North America and Continental Europe to continue in the coming year. In North America we posted a third quarter with revenue up 1% sequentially when margins were down 67 basis points to 19.6% driven by expected seasonal impact. On a year-over-year basis revenues grew 7% and margins were up 46 basis points. In the Gulf of Mexico, deep water activity remained high in the fourth quarter and the offshore rig county is expected to show strong growth also in 2014. In the land market activity was solid with the fourth quarter U.S. rig count remaining flat sequentially while the seasonal activity recovery in Canada stayed in line with 2012 levels. The main challenge in the North America land market is still pricing and we saw further downwards pricing pressure in most product lines in the fourth quarter partly amplified by the renegotiation and roll over of several key contracts. In hydraulic fracturing we continue to gain share in the fourth quarter driven by new technology sales and operational efficiency and we took the opportunity to allow another fracturing fluid operation in addition to the four fleets we added in Q3.
 : And second the fracturing fluid which enables the control of solid coupling within the fracture can allow more the fracture height to be effective across and thereby further enhance the production from the well. To address these opportunities we will introduce in the coming quarters the broadband family of fracturing services which will include new engineered tool systems and corresponding hardware completion solutions. We’re very excited by the production enhancement potential of these technologies and will share more information as we complete the remaining field test and commercialization milestones. In another market we’re focusing on in North America land due to a significant growth potential is the artificial lift market. In line with SPM in the past quarters acquired a number of Broadcom companies covering the key liquid producing shale basins in the U.S. and Canada. We will now combine the offering from these strong basin specific companies in our existing artificial lift business in North America land to provide a life of well lift solution to our customers using our production engineering expertise and expenses monitoring and data integration capabilities. Let me now take a few minutes to summarize our full year 2013 results and achievements before we turn to the 2014 outlook. In terms of financial performance 2013 was a very strong year for us where we continue to outperform our competitors in terms of top-line growth, margin expansion, earnings per share growth and free cash flow generation. The results were driven by strong new technology sales and a relentless focus on flawless execution and cost and resource management throughout organization.

The results were driven by strong new technology sales and a relentless focus on flawless execution and cost and resource management throughout organization.
 : While these achievements are obtained in the past, there certainly has been demonstration of our ability to formulate or executive plan that drive our company forward and should also instill confidence in our ability to continue the current trend of our financial outperformance. Let’s now turn to the outlook for 2014 where we expect the global economy to continue to improve building on a positive data point seen in the past quarters and translate again both a higher GDP growth rate and higher growth in global oil demand compared to 2013. Correspondingly we also expect the global oil market to be well supplied in the coming year driven by continued growth in North America liquids production, leading supply and demand relatively well balanced with fair capacity excluding Libya in the range of 4 million barrels per day and this continuous support for Brent crude prices around $100 per barrel. The international gas market is also expected to remain stable supported by strong demand in Asia and improving demand in Europe.
 : Translating this macro picture into activity, in North America we expect strong growth and growth in Mexico driven by the influence of additional deep water rigs and on land in North America we expect solid growth in activity but for the pricing pressure we will likely have some impact on how much of this activity growth is translated into revenue and margin progression. In the international markets we expect growth in Latin America to present by in Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela. (Indiscernible) the main growth market will again be sub-Sahara Africa and Russia while an in EMEA growth will be spear ahead by Saudi Arabia, Iraq and United Arab Emirates and China. Although we remain positive and optimistic with respect to the coming year as we again aim to cause solid double-digit growth in earnings per share, to firstly by further market share gains on the back of our new technology and secondly by our ability to generate superior increment to margins to the cost and resource efficiency of our execution. In terms of how 2014 will unfold we expect the second and third quarter to again show the strongest sequential role while the first quarter similar to previous year should be decline in earnings and margins due to the normal seasonal slowdown and lower products and multi-client sales. We’re all proud of the progress we have made over the past 12 months and we have patience and ready and motivated to further improving our achievements in the coming year. That concludes my remarks but before we open up for questions I would like to make a brief announcement. After all the six years in-charge of investor relations Malcolm Theobald on February 1st take on a new role in the company as President of our drill based business.   I would like to take the opportunity to thank Malcolm for his support and contributions as Head of Investor Relations and wish him the best of luck in his new assignment. Malcolm will be replaced by Simon Burns [ph] as Head of Investor Relations and Simon was previously in-charge of our North Sea GeoMarkets. With that we will open up for questions.

Malcolm Theobald:  Thank you Paal. John we will now take questions.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  You have made a big push an emphasis on returns on capital efficiency of your previous two quarterly calls in particular and we can see the results now some pretty strong free cash flow as a percentage both of sales and EBITDA but can you talk just a little bit as to how much more efficiency is there squeezed out of the system now? Because you seem to have come quite a long way already.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I mean as you see from my numbers and as you point out, we have stepped our focus on cash generation this year. We have put a lot more emphasis in that throughout the entire management and even it's starting to pay out. Now in the first three quarters of 2013 we generated around $3 billion of free cash flow and in Q4 alone we generated 2.5 billion on top of that which is the new quarterly record right? So the key drivers I think is both, it's management focus on working capital and asset utilization and we want to continue to perform over that into 2014. We indicated that on CapEx next year is going to be around $3.8 billion and the continued growth in the top line and the bottom line and I’m optimistic that reaching further step up the generation of free cash flow. It's essential how we manage our cash flow. Simon do you want to, a few things on that?
Simon Ayat:  So basically if you look at our cash flow generation the last couple of years we suffered a bit from the increase in working capital and the increase in working capital as we have mentioned before was our way of setting up all the Smith acquisition that we made in order to distribute the product further worldwide. The current performance that we have seen is back to normal and I think we will continue to be performing very well as far as the working capital efficiency and as Paal mentioned we are finally got to a point where our CapEx as a percentage of revenue at a manageable level and I think the cash flow generation will continue to be strong as you’ve seen it in 2013.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: What is it in your business that gives you confidence that you can take CapEx down while your revenue is increasing? I mean that’s something which sort of no other company has not been able to do.
Paal Kibsgaard:  By coming down to some of the elements that we have discussed around the internal transformation. There is a lot of focus and lot of things we’re doing to guide asset efficiency or asset utilization that revolves around better sharing between locations you know quicker turnaround in maintenance and a better transportation network setup as well. So, yes we’re going to continue to grow in 2014 an we’re taking CapEx slightly down and I think I’m quite comfortable with really different [ph] levels we’re making in the in-line growth with higher than what we anticipate. We have the option of further increasing CapEx but as of the $3.8 billion number that I’m indicating I’m quite comfortable with.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  Just little clarification Paal you didn’t sound particularly upbeat about general pricing trends, either in North America or international for kind of commodity and the type of services. Yes you highlighted but in your case if I heard you correctly you had a 5% positive pricing indicator because of technology and again, could you kind of elaborate a little bit on exactly what you mean by that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well the revenues were rich indicators basically we talked to revenue we generate for the unit rig activity and but using more revenue earnings well obviously that house [ph] but also by substituting existing basic technologies with new technologies really command the pricing premium that basically helps drive that indicator out. So on average in 2013 that revenue for pricing indicator grew by 5% over 2012 which obviously helps both in the top-line and on the bottom line.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:   Okay you also highlighted the higher price contracts rolling off, how do you see 2014 kind of the headwind there and the tailwind on your technology and ability to push more value as through products offering.
Paal Kibsgaard : Well if you look at 2013 it's one of the highest years we have had in new technologies both in new technologies that we were introduced over past years and we track it very (indiscernible) and also the technologies that were introduced in the past five years which we also track very closely. So we have a number of new technologies that came on 2013 and a similar number is not even higher coming up in 2014. So we will continue to leverage what we have introduced in the past year and also augment it a significant number of new technologies coming out in 2014. So I’m quite positive and optimistic that through the new technology introductions we can continue to drive the effective pricing up. Now big contracts like for instance we saw in Mexico recently it's continue to be a big, quite aggressively and competitively on the basic pricing but having a number of new technologies that we’re introducing we should be able to continue to our improve that revenue for rig pricing indicator.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities:  Paal can I follow-up on the comment that you made about the new technology on the fracturing side. You commented the lesson of two things one just fracture stage effectiveness and two I guess in propagation but the technology platform that’s looking to be rolled out this year looks to be more than just fluids involving the hardware et cetera. Can you expand upon that?
Paal Kibsgaard:  With further comments on the Broadband family until we have completed the key testing and the commercialization milestones. The few things I mentioned are around high precision fracturing where we cross address each perforation cluster as well as having finished with which better control to sort of coupling. There will be technologies in this family that will advance those, there might be some other things there is lot of we will talk about that when we have firmed out the key testing and we’re ready to roll it out.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities: Okay but it's fair to assume at this point that it really is sort of an end to end solution as opposed to a single point solution the way highway was introduced. Is that a fair characterization?
Paal Kibsgaard : That is fair to assume, yes.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities: Okay great. And Simon, quick one for you, the working capital frankly I have never seen a $45 billion revenue company use almost no working capital for the course of 12 months. First of all congratulations on that and second one is that something you can expect to continue in ’14 and what have been the major levers that have brought that about this year?
Simon Ayat :
.:
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities: Okay so when you say back to normal I mean is it still 1% of revenue plus or minus?
Simon Ayat: That would be yes more or less the case.
Operator: Next we will go to David Anderson with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.
David Anderson - JPMorgan Securities:  So Paal you were talking about your expectation for about I think I believe I heard 6% kind of overall E&P spend, guidance of earnings up double-digits. Can you talk a bit about how much that earnings improvement in ’14 is going to be related to the internal transformation on the efficiency and the asset turns?
Paal Kibsgaard : While if you look at the solid double digit growth in earnings per share it's kind of a combination of the two (indiscernible). So we aim to grow our foot line faster than the growth in the E&P spend. This is going to be driven by new technology which we just talked about but also the quality of our service and our integration capability. But we all plan to continue to expand margins even in a challenging pricing environment. That’s going to be driven by our execution efficiency and our ongoing transformation in the program. So how much is going to come from each, we obviously have a very clear on view I’m not going to go into the detail probably but I think both of them will be very good contributors.
David Anderson - JPMorgan Securities:

Paal Kibsgaard:
 :
Operator: Our next question is from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brad Handler – Jefferies:  If I could I guess follow-up on that if perhaps you can give us some perspective because part of what I think is raised concern among investment community is the lack of contracts recently for deep water rigs for example casting somewhat of a shadow on the what had been the fairly obvious trajectory for a deep water activity growth. Do you have any thoughts on the nature of that and then presumably there is a release of a lot of the contracts that you would envision happening soon?
Paal Kibsgaard :
 :
Brad Handler – Jefferies: Understand, okay. Maybe it's a related follow-up maybe it isn't but the conversation has shifted to sort of an overall level of spending from what had been a mixed conversation a little bit ago but I wouldn’t mind coming back to that the mix of exploration versus development. In your modeling as you see ’14 playing out, so a two part question first is there a discernible mix that you look for and then in a sense the second part of the question is does it matter as we look at some of your what I think are some of your higher margin businesses on the exploration side if there is to be a move away from that, how much can you mention seismic in or seismic was mentioned by your colleague earlier. How much of any of that matter? That mix shift if you see it coming for ’14?
Paal Kibsgaard : Basically we have a very broad and well-balanced portfolio. So these shifts they might have small impact but overall I’m not overly worried about that going into 2014. With respect to exploration we still see growth in exploration in 2014. It's going to be lower than the roughly 10% that growth that we saw in 2013 but still decent growth. Now in terms of the nature of the growth in exploration we expect this to be more well related again so we’re pretty clear that the flattening of the pricing spend is happening. There has been a lot of data acquired in recent years. So the growth in exploration is going to be more well related than exploration related and well that is that means that it's a more challenging environment for WesternGeco it still bodes well for our Wireline well testing and drilling product line. So of course they called in the balance.
Operator: And next we will go to James West with Barclays. Please go ahead.
James West - Barclays Capital: So Paal I think we have gone beat up the E&P spend numbers globally and it's clear that you guys intend to grow faster than 6%. Maybe if I turn to one of the markets I guess it's been more troubling for the industry which is North America. We’re looking at least at some acceleration or some increase in spend in North America pricing obviously still weakish but do you think with this pickup in activity that’s envisioned, you hit a point where these product lines that had been at a balance can start to come back into balance and maybe pricing is no longer that much of a concern?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well we would like if that happen but if you referred to the fracturing if I go like fracturing there is still today significant industry overcapacity of horsepower. So at this stage we do not expect the market to reach equilibrium in 2014. Now in terms of activity for North America you expect solid growth in activity on land in 2014 and a lot of this is still going to be driven by further improvements in drilling and fracking efficiency. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we do not see any significant combat in in dry gas (indiscernible). So if you look at the trends that you saw in 2013 I think they are continuing into 2014 and North America last is going to be I think more of a same.
James West - Barclays Capital: And then maybe a perhaps on related follow-up but talking about your technology pipeline it sounds like there is acceleration in new technology introductions. Are these more focused on the U.S. land market as you kind of highlighted some of the stuffs that you’re testing right now or is this global and you just choose to highlight the North America technology?
Paal Kibsgaard : It's more than up against, I choose to focusing on North America because this is where I think technology will have a significant impact in terms of how the market is going to be shaped going forward. We talked about that on previous calls. We obviously have a broad I would say portfolio of new technologies coming out also addressing the international markets with the range of businesses we all present but I choose to highlight North America land and attracting on the coal.
Operator: Our next question is from (indiscernible). Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Paal I appreciate the comment especially on the near term outlook for 1Q and the seasonality, I was curious so if we think about adding back the negative impact you saw on fourth quarter for Iraq. We thought about first quarter Middle-East Asia margins let’s say should we assume that add back of revenue and the attaining profitability at least offsets whatever multi-client excuse me you’re in product sales that you lose traditionally in the first quarter so perhaps maybe revenue flattish margins flattish is opposed to down in Middle-East Asia for 1Q?
Paal Kibsgaard : Well the question is to if you want to welcome to give you a specific number or go much more in detail. I would say the change the sequential change both in revenues and margins in both environment I think is going to be more and less in line in what you see at an average over the past couple of years. So there are a lot of moving parts in our business and the way we see we do want to at this stage that is going to be more or less at normal seasonal growth that we see.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay my follow-up Simon will be for you. I guess with the dividend raise now by looking consensus numbers for ’14 the dividend is coming by a 28% of net income, is there a target range that you guys have as a management team or as a Board that we should be thinking about longer term here in terms of where that dividend potentially can go as a percentage of net income.
Simon Ayat: You know if you look back on several years now, we look at our dividend every year in January and we decide based on the level of activity, the cash flow where we’re going to be as far as the dividend is concerned. The 28% this is on the higher side and reflect the new level of cash flows that we are at and we will continue to be but there is no target number for the dividend. We will look at it every year and we will reflect basically on the condition of the business and the growth in the cash flow but there is target number.
Unidentified Analyst: And Simon do we just, should we view the assumption of debt during the quarter specifically just to fund the share repurchase program and is that something that we should expect to continue and what is still a little interest rate environment?
Simon Ayat: Frankly we don’t need to borrow to fund the repurchase, we did the borrowing to take advantage of the lower interest rate which as you know kind of climbed the business during the quarter so we did it at the right time and we have some maturing that’s coming in the first half of 2014 which we will use this excess cash to bring it down.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert – Simmons: With regards to 2014 I’m not sure if you made mention of this or not yet but with regard to your international margins in ’13 incremental were kind of 40% to 45% in that range for last year. Should we expect much the same in 2014 with regard to international incremental margins?
Paal Kibsgaard : Well we want to try I can’t promise but we have a lot of drivers that we’re working on to which is kind of you know puts us to try to refuse that. But now it's going to come down to a number of things but the new technology introduction and a further improvement in efficiency and quality are one of the key drivers. So, I can’t promise but we’re certainly going to try.
Bill Herbert – Simmons: Okay and secondly back to the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, if I look at that what you guys have done over the past 5-6 years on average earnings per share is down a low double digit percentage, quarter-on-quarter is that what we should be expecting or modeling for the first quarter?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well what number did you say?
Bill Herbert – Simmons: A low double digit percentage quarter-on-quarter.
Paal Kibsgaard : Yeah I would say plus minus 10% is the rough, is the average of the past 3-4 years, yeah
Bill Herbert – Simmons: Okay so that a buck 20 an buck 21 I know you’re not endorsing a specific number but that’s not necessarily an implausible place to start for at Q1.
Paal Kibsgaard:
.: 
Operator: And next go to Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita - UBS Securities:  Paal could you give us a little further color on the North American price weakness, obviously we had seasonality in Q4 and what are you seeing in Q1? Is it too earlier to tell or do you think those stay continued price weakness into 2014?
Paal Kibsgaard : So season for us we would have appropriate impact in pricing in Q1 that’s mainly down to the renegotiation and rollover of all the certain contract that we have. So we believe that a few of them during Q4 with some impact in Q4 we get a full impact of those in Q1 and the other contract as well that will probably impact in Q1 to a certain extent. So that’s dated for the kind of pricing comments that I already made.  
Angie Sedita - UBS Securities: All right and then on the overcapacity kind of in reference to James question certainly going to be able to, the capacity in 2014, is your thoughts that we will certainly see that in 2015 as well based on the market condition as we see it today?
Paal Kibsgaard : Well I think I will focus my comments on ’14 for now and things can move fast in North America land but we’re pretty confident that we will not reach equilibrium in 2014.
Angie Sedita - UBS Securities: And then as I’m really a follow-up on Mexico, congratulations currently on the market share gains. Some color there on when you expect to mobilize equipment or actually start activity in Mexico and then comments on Mexico longer term. Obviously expectations for the region are fairly high, is it still too early to tell how meaningful Mexico will be or are you becoming more confident on Mexico?
Paal Kibsgaard : As I’ve said in my prepared remarks the early indication for these (indiscernible) we will have a pretty solid market share gain. Now these contracts are not finalized yet, they will be finalized during the first quarter. We expect to mobilize the additional resources that we need to take on the additional work during Q2 and that we will get into kind of full operation on these contracts in the second half of the year. So we still see H1 [ph] activity to be somewhat challenging partly due to the (indiscernible) slowdown but I think H2 [ph] will be better for us given the market share gains. Now with respect to the and as you recall obviously the net profits for the industry in Mexico but the earlier impact on our activity will be 2015.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Crandell with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities:  Well the Chinese companies CNOOC, PetroChina seem to be estimating a lot lower growth in E&P CapEx in 2014. Do you expect that as well and can you characterize which is just being in terms of the awards and business coming out of the Chinese companies?
Paal Kibsgaard : Well we continue to see strong growth and activity for us throughout in China on land and this is driven by both conventional price gaps and there are certain expense (indiscernible) right, so partially this is through the market penetration for us. There is lot better demand now for our new technology, for our fracking expertise and also for our further management capability. So I still the overall I still think China as one of the fastest growing geo-market for us in 2014 as it was in 2013. I have a pretty positive outlook on China for the coming year.
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities: Okay and then my follow-up is if you could comment on Brazil you had some cautionary comments about Brazil. I assume you’re forecasting a lower level of business out of Brazil. If that’s true what kind of drop do you see in business there for either drop in the market or drop in business for Schlumberger in 2014?
Paal Kibsgaard : I would say overall rig activity we expect to be flat in 2014 which is going to be another challenging year. Exactly what’s going to happen (indiscernible) I’m not going to going reach out there but it will be a challenging year you know coping with the frac activity which is obviously lower than what we were expecting going back 12 to 18 months.
Operator: And we will go to Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: 
 :
Paal Kibsgaard : I don’t have the detail for those available (indiscernible). So I can’t comment on them and follow-up maybe Jeff.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Okay and then how should we think about from a top down standpoint measuring the progress Schlumberger makes on some of the cost and efficiency initiatives in ’14? Do we just watch that through the margin line or through incremental or what’s an external measuring sticks we can use to judge you by?
Paal Kibsgaard : Well I think both the margin probably is going to be a good measure of it, it think also it will have some impact on our ability to generate the free cash flow. So I think both of those are good yardsticks to look at.
Operator: We will go to Scott Gruber with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber – Bernstein: Just one quick one from me, Simon can you provide some color on the CapEx trends in North America versus rest of the world and where you’re spending it down equally or is it weighted toward one region?
Simon Ayat: It's really in-line with the rest of the world. I mean you know last year it was lower because obviously the pressure pumping is consuming less as we have consumed some of the excess equipment. Exact figure I don’t know ready with me but I will follow-up with you on this.
Scott Gruber - Bernstein: But there is you know I was thinking of the international side there is no bigger drop on the international side versus domestic at this point?
Paal Kibsgaard : If you look at 2013 we obviously stayed back significantly in North America due to basically hardly any CapEx required for pressure pumping. So I think what you see going into 2014 is an more even increased North America versus international and obviously we included in North America to growth of Mexico where we see had price significant growth and these services are also quite capital intensive.
Operator: And we will go to Jud Bailey with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
Jud Bailey - ISI Group:  I wanted to follow-up on Latin America that was difficult market for Schlumberger and for the rest of the industry in 2013 although you still have to grow margins. With the Mexico work ramping up, with Argentina growing how much of a pickup in growth can we see in 2014? If you grew low single digits in this year or last year rather is that a market that can grow high single digits with Mexico coming back and Argentina growing or is that a stretch?
Paal Kibsgaard : Jud we typically don’t comment on details kind of growth outlook for either but I would say that we’re aiming to grow in Latin American in 2014. What level I can’t really comment on.
Jud Bailey - ISI Group: And just another question, you were able to like as I mentioned grow margins pretty nicely despite a difficult market in Latin American last year. You mentioned cutting cost in Brazil given your cost structure down. Can you comment maybe on how to think about margins in Latin America for 2014? Does it stay kind of soft until activity in Mexico starts to pick back up?
Paal Kibsgaard : 
 :
Operator: Our next question is from Robin Shoemaker with Citi. Please go ahead.
Robin Shoemaker – Citi: Paal you mentioned that you’ve seen price weakness across most product lines in North America. I wonder among all your product service lines and drill bits and fluids and LWD, MWD et cetera where are you seeing relative pricing stability in contrast to areas that are weakening?
Paal Kibsgaard : In North America.
Robin Shoemaker - Citi: In North America, yes.
Paal Kibsgaard : Yeah I think for both of the product lines we’re seeing continuous pricing challenges. I would say the only one that has kind of stood out as a positive and that’s very much driven I would say new technology introduction is actually a good thing. So but the other ones given the market conditions are all facing pricing challenges.
Robin Shoemaker - Citi: Okay and you highlighted artificial lift as an area of focus in the shale play. Now obviously a lot of the and the lot of the shale plays that have lower productivity wells, ESP Technology is not generally employed. So what is Schlumberger solutions that you’re working for lower productivity wells?
Paal Kibsgaard : Well what we have done over the past couple of quarters which I had in my prepared remarks is basically that we are both in number of smaller Broadcom [ph] companies for the key liquids shale basins both in the U.S. and Canada. So our plan is to combine the offering from the biggest Broadcom [ph] companies with our existing artificial lift business and then the objective is then to provide a life of well lift solution to the customer base. So we will do that by looking at what is the idea of lift or ESPs and lot of technologies to optimize production and we’re going to obviously leverage our production adhering expertise and our ability to monitor and integrate the production based on from these wells.
Operator: Our next question is from Edward Muztafago with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.
Edward Muztafago - Societe Generale:  I did have one follow-up question on sort of the incoming rigs and specifically as it relates to the Gulf of Mexico. There has been a little bit of chatter recently that while there is a fairly large influx of rigs coming in and we may see a little bit exodus out of the Gulf as well and I guess what I’m wondering is on a net basis does the exodus you know sort of the lower specification, shallower water rigs have material effect on Schlumberger or you know do you think that because you’re little bit more deep water focus does that say on that’s less of a concern?
Paal Kibsgaard : Well when I comment on the Gulf of Mexico my comments are generally focused on deep water which is obviously a large part of one operation and so while there might be some offshore rigs we’re still quite optimistic in terms of the rig projections and the results for the Gulf of Mexico or deep water in particular for 2014 and that’s what I’m basing the outlook on.
Edward Muztafago - Societe Generale: And then this is kind of a follow-up to the revenue per rig discussions in North America, you know obviously one of the things that we have seen as the well count go up fairly dramatically in relation to rigs and so I haven't run the numbers I’m hoping maybe you will have but if we were to actually look at sort of revenue per well, is it probably a better metric. Do we see the same sort of trend between Schlumberger revenue as you would with rigs but maybe to a lesser degree that is the technology upscale has driven some atypical improvement in that metric.
Paal Kibsgaard:  So for the revenue per well in North America land I don’t have that data available at this stage. I would still say that that’s probably you know not up as much as the 5% in terms of global revenue, international revenue that I was referring to. So there is continuous negative pricing pressure in North America. So I would say revenue per well is probably more challenged than revenue per rig over a quarter.
Malcolm Theobald:  Okay that’s all the time we have for questions today. So now on behalf of the Schlumberger management team I would like to thank you for participating in today’s call. I would like to also personally thank you for your support. John will now provide the closing comments.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions; instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. With that being said, I’ll turn the conference now over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, John. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2013 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York City and joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I’d like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.29. This is the highest earnings per share for a quarter in the history of Schlumberger. It represents an increase of $0.14 sequentially and it is $0.25 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, last quarter we completed the wind down of our operations in Iran and as a result, this business was classified as a discontinued operation. All the prior period amounts have been restated. Third quarter revenue of $11.6 billion increased 3.8% sequentially with 7% growth in North America and 3% International. As you will recall from a financial reporting standpoint, we do not consolidate the OneSubsea joint venture. As such, this was the first quarter we did not record any revenue from the subsea business that we transferred to the venture. Excluding this effect, revenue grew by over 5%. Oilfield Services pretax operating income increased 9.6% sequentially, while the pretax operating margins improved 114 basis points to 21.5%. Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3.2 billion increased 7.3% and pretax income grew by just over 8%. This resulted in margins improving to 30.4%. This growth was driven by very strong international performances in both Wireline and Testing Services, most notably in Russia. Improved vessel utilization at WesternGeco also contributed to the growth. Drilling Group revenue of $4.4 billion increased 2.8% and margin improved by 154 basis points to 20.3%. These increases were largely attributable to the Drilling and Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust offshore activity. Production Group revenue of $4 billion increased 2.5%, while pretax income increased 13.1%. This resulted in margin expansion of 165 basis points to 17.6%. Excluding the effects of the transfer of our subsea business to OneSubsea, Production Group revenue grew by over 6%. This growth was led by Well Services on a strong recovery following the seasonal spring breakup in Canada last quarter. Increased activity for Completion and Artificial Lift as well as continued increasing profitability in SPM, were also significant contributors to the growth. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits was 22.7% in the third quarter, compared to 23.3% in the previous quarter, reflecting the business mix between North America and International. The year-to-date effective tax rate for 2013 is 23.2%. From a cash flow perspective, we have generated approximately $6 billion of cash flow from operation during the first nine months of this year. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities, while at the same time, returning over $2.7 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases during this period.
 : And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Our third quarter results continued to show good progress driven by solid performance in both the International and North American markets. Our strong focus on integration, quality and efficiency remains core to our execution, and I am pleased with the response we are seeing from our organization in addition to the impact the efforts are having on our results. Sequentially, revenue grew by 4% excluding our subsea business, which in Q3 is included in the OneSubsea JV, while margins expanded by 114 basis points to yield a 10% growth in pretax operating income. Compared to the same quarter last year, pretax operating income was up 20%. New technology sales coupled with further market share gains contributed strongly to the quarter’s results, and this is also reflected in our revenue per rig indicator, which improved again sequentially. The size and breadth of our operations and the quality of our execution allowed us to once again show widespread consistency in terms of financial performance, with all four operating areas posting operating margins north of 20%. In addition and for the second quarter in a row, we posted sequential incremental margins over 50%, while free cash flow progressed from the already solid levels of Q2 to reach $1.5 billion driven by improving asset utilization and tight management of working capital. Our International business continued to strengthen in the third quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 12% and margin expansion of 134 basis points to reach 23%. Sequential revenue growth was 3%, dampened by operational delays in some regions, but proactive management and disciplined execution allowed us to generate 73% incremental margins on this growth. In spite of the operational delays experienced in Q3, we have not seen any structural changes to customer plans and we continue to maintain a positive outlook for our International business. In terms of pricing, we are not seeing any signs of an inflection point. However, the current operating environment with highly competitive pricing on basic services and slow but steady activity growth where we can get a premium for new technology and for the quality of our execution, suits us very well, as it plays to our strengths and allows us to continue to generate superior financial results. In Latin America, revenue was up 1% sequentially, while margins were flat at 20.6%. The sequential results were driven by strong performance throughout the area with the exception of Mexico and Brazil, where continuing challenges tampered growth. While we see the current headwinds reducing somewhat in 2014, we expect the situation for our overall business in the region to remain more or less unchanged in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis and in spite of the ongoing challenges, revenues were up 4%, while margins expanded 273 basis points. In Mexico, revenue was down sequentially driven by the completion of contracts in the north and lower product sales offshore, which were only partly offset by the ramp up of activity in the south. In spite of the challenges we had faced in Mexico this year, we remain optimistic on the longer-term outlook for this market, and we are actively positioning ourselves for the future opportunities. In Brazil, revenue was also lower sequentially due to the startup of new contracts with Petrobras as well as due to lower activity for both independent and international customers. Based on the latest customer plans, we expect our activity to remain flat in the country in the fourth quarter. Elsewhere in Latin America, our business is progressing well driven by Ecuador, where the Shushufindi project continues to perform better than plan, by Argentina where we are actively involved in the Vaca Muerta shale work and by Venezuela where we are still ramping up activity following the signing of the payment agreement in the second quarter. In the Middle Eastern Asia, results were particularly strong, with sequential revenue growth of 5%, while margins increased 151 basis points to 26%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 25% while margins were up by 330 basis points. In the Middle East, sequential growth was, again, solid in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, while the highest growth rate was seen in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where we also have very strong market positions. We are currently in the process of transferring in additional people and equipment to Saudi Arabia to keep pace with the additional work that we are taking on, while the – while in the United Arab Emirates, we have just completed a large mobilization linked to a recent major contract win.
 : In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was up 2% sequentially and margins increased 189 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 7% while margins were up 83% basis points. Russia was, again, a major driver for our performance posting a record quarter with strong sequential activity growth as well as excellent incremental margins. Our wide footprint in the region provides a solid foundation for our business, which is essential for addressing such a large and diverse market. These sequential results were driven by Russia land and Sakhalin on high exploration and development drilling, and going forward, we continue to see Russia as one of our fastest-growing markets. In the North Sea, sequential growth was driven by strong WesternGeco seismic activity and solid drilling activity in Norway, while our UK business was impacted by summer rig maintenance. In North Africa, we had another challenging quarter in terms of top line growth due to operational delays in Algeria and continued security challenges and lower rig activity in Libya. In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity was mixed as a result of project delays linked to the influx of new rigs to the region. Still the overall activity outlook remains robust as the surge of rigs into the market continues and as customers firm up exploration programs in frontier countries. In North America, we had a very strong quarter with revenue up 7% sequentially to set an all time high and with margins expanding by 57 basis points to reach 20.3%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 9% and margins were up 176 basis points. In the land market, the U.S. rig count remained flat sequentially while the seasonal recovery in Canada was more or less on par with last year. The downwards pricing pressure continued in most product lines in the third quarter including pressure pumping, although at a slowing rate. Looking at our land performance, I am very pleased with the quality and efficiency of our execution as well as with the team work within our organization, which is a key driver for our results. We have come a long way since we started the transformation of our North America land business three years ago, to the point that we are now setting the pace in North America land just as we do in the rest of the world in terms of both new technology deployment as well as financial results. As an illustration of this, we activated four additional hydraulic fracturing fleets in U.S. land during the third quarter, following a number of recent contract wins. As a result, our third quarter stage count increased by 7% sequentially. Looking at the North America offshore markets, we also posted solid sequential growth driven by new technology sales and the quality of our execution. Offshore Eastern Canada, we successfully completed an isometric survey in early September and activity continued to be strong in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with minimal impacts from the hurricane season so far this year. Let’s then turn to technology, where I will give you an update on our ongoing progress in the shale markets in North America. Over the past 12 months, we have continued to actively promote our shale reservoir workflow to the market with a strong focus on optimizing both well locations as well as completion design. As part of these efforts, we have introduced a data consortium business model, where multiple customers with neighboring acreage can contribute reservoir and production data and then co-fund field and well studies as well as the construction of 3D reservoir models for the shale plays. In return, each customer receives all the findings and conclusions from the consortium studies in addition to the reservoir model covering their acreage. We have so far conducted three such studies with very interesting findings and conclusions and these studies together with our technologies and workflows has helped to significantly improve the well performance for the participating customers. One major conclusion we have confirmed is that in order to optimize production, recovery and costs of the shale developments, there is a clear need to shift focus from the level of a stage down to the level of the individual perforation clusters that make up a stage. The reason for this is that the studies including production logs show that in traditional completions on average between 30% and 70% of the perforation clusters do not contribute to production. This means that we are not effectively addressing the available shale reservoir throughout the entire length of a stage and that we generally over-fracture a subset of the perforation clusters. Based on these findings, we are actively working on a number of technologies that target this opportunity. During the third quarter, we started field testing one of these new technologies, a novel solids-based diversion technology. The diversion pill is added to the fracturing fluid at various times during the pumping of a stage and this effectively seals off the clusters that are currently taking frac fluid. This allows us to access the perforation clusters that have yet to be properly fractured. This new diversion technology has two primary applications. first, in improving production and recovery by ensuring that more perforation clusters are accessed within a traditional stage; and second, in lowering completion costs by increasing the length of a stage, thereby reducing the number of frac plugs installed and subsequently milled in the well. Diversion technologies are not new to the fracturing market. they have been around in the industry for a while in various forms, however, so far without showing tangible or consistent results. The novelty of our approach is in the robust design and engineering of the diversion pill and the fact that field test results so far are showing very promising results. We plan to continue our field testing of this technology in the coming quarters, and in addition, we will also evaluate the technology as a potential way to refracture existing wells that are underperforming in terms of production. In parallel with our growing new technology penetration of the North America shale market, we have been gaining market share in hydraulic fracturing in recent quarters at what we consider acceptable incremental margins. These market share gains led us to activate the four additional frac fleets I referred to earlier in my comments. In terms of the equipment, the four new fleets were mobilized from pumps made available from our existing fleets that are in operation, due to steadily improving asset utilization and hence represent a zero net capacity addition to our field operations. This significant achievement is a result of ongoing R&D work focused on improving the reliability, extending the maintenance intervals, and reducing the maintenance costs of our hydraulic fracturing fleet. The strategy driving these R&D efforts has been to improve the design of the consumable part of our pump, rather than building a new pump that requires additional capital investment. These innovations have already helped to improve reliability and reduce the maintenance costs of our asset base. Currently, only a subset of our fleet has been upgraded, but we expect that through our normal maintenance schedule, we will have the entire fleet upgraded by the end of 2014. This upgrade will be fully covered through our ongoing operating costs and involves no capital investments. Let’s now turn to the macroenvironment, where we in recent months have seen a number of positive signs in the world economy. The Eurozone is now out of its longest recession on record, the U.S. continues to show favorable trends in spite of the fiscal debate and the most recent data from China suggests a lower risk of a significant slowdown. Overall, these factors are offsetting lower growth expectations in some of the emerging economies. These trends are currently expected to continue in 2014, translating into both a higher GDP growth rate and increasing global oil demand compared to 2013. On the supply side, spare capacity, including the shut-in production in Libya, remains stable at around 4.5 million barrels per day. And even with an unlikely increase of Iranian crude exports in 2014, spare capacity will likely remain in the range of 5 million barrels per day in the coming year. At this stage, we therefore expect continued support for Brent crude prices around $100 per barrel going into 2014. However, the makeup of the risk premium is likely to shift somewhat with lower supply uncertainty and potentially lower geopolitical risk, offset by more resilient demand and lower macroeconomic concerns. The international gas market is expected to remain stable, supported by strong demand in Asia, while in the U.S. resilient production levels and strong competition with coal indicates that our recovery in dry gas drilling activity continues to be pushed out in time. In terms of E&P spend, the second half of this year is unfolding in line with expectations. Visibility of 2014 is still limited, as our customers are in their planning process. but at this stage, we foresee a continuation of the overall trend seen in 2013, which should yield another year of steady activity growth. In this environment, our entire organization continues to focus on both new technology sales and the quality and efficiency of our execution. In parallel with our ongoing operations, we are actively pursuing our internal transformation programs focused on leveraging the size of our operations and the breadth of our offering and with a clear goal of further elevating our performance in terms of top line growth, margin expansion and cash generation. That concludes my remarks. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.
 : In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was up 2% sequentially and margins increased 189 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 7% while margins were up 83% basis points.

This means that we are not effectively addressing the available shale reservoir throughout the entire length of a stage and that we generally over-fracture a subset of the perforation clusters. Based on these findings, we are actively working on a number of technologies that target this opportunity. During the third quarter, we started field testing one of these new technologies, a novel solids-based diversion technology. The diversion pill is added to the fracturing fluid at various times during the pumping of a stage and this effectively seals off the clusters that are currently taking frac fluid. This allows us to access the perforation clusters that have yet to be properly fractured. This new diversion technology has two primary applications. first, in improving production and recovery by ensuring that more perforation clusters are accessed within a traditional stage; and second, in lowering completion costs by increasing the length of a stage, thereby reducing the number of frac plugs installed and subsequently milled in the well. Diversion technologies are not new to the fracturing market. they have been around in the industry for a while in various forms, however, so far without showing tangible or consistent results. The novelty of our approach is in the robust design and engineering of the diversion pill and the fact that field test results so far are showing very promising results. We plan to continue our field testing of this technology in the coming quarters, and in addition, we will also evaluate the technology as a potential way to refracture existing wells that are underperforming in terms of production. In parallel with our growing new technology penetration of the North America shale market, we have been gaining market share in hydraulic fracturing in recent quarters at what we consider acceptable incremental margins. These market share gains led us to activate the four additional frac fleets I referred to earlier in my comments. In terms of the equipment, the four new fleets were mobilized from pumps made available from our existing fleets that are in operation, due to steadily improving asset utilization and hence represent a zero net capacity addition to our field operations. This significant achievement is a result of ongoing R&D work focused on improving the reliability, extending the maintenance intervals, and reducing the maintenance costs of our hydraulic fracturing fleet. The strategy driving these R&D efforts has been to improve the design of the consumable part of our pump, rather than building a new pump that requires additional capital investment. These innovations have already helped to improve reliability and reduce the maintenance costs of our asset base. Currently, only a subset of our fleet has been upgraded, but we expect that through our normal maintenance schedule, we will have the entire fleet upgraded by the end of 2014. This upgrade will be fully covered through our ongoing operating costs and involves no capital investments. Let’s now turn to the macroenvironment, where we in recent months have seen a number of positive signs in the world economy. The Eurozone is now out of its longest recession on record, the U.S. continues to show favorable trends in spite of the fiscal debate and the most recent data from China suggests a lower risk of a significant slowdown. Overall, these factors are offsetting lower growth expectations in some of the emerging economies. These trends are currently expected to continue in 2014, translating into both a higher GDP growth rate and increasing global oil demand compared to 2013. On the supply side, spare capacity, including the shut-in production in Libya, remains stable at around 4.5 million barrels per day. And even with an unlikely increase of Iranian crude exports in 2014, spare capacity will likely remain in the range of 5 million barrels per day in the coming year. At this stage, we therefore expect continued support for Brent crude prices around $100 per barrel going into 2014. However, the makeup of the risk premium is likely to shift somewhat with lower supply uncertainty and potentially lower geopolitical risk, offset by more resilient demand and lower macroeconomic concerns. The international gas market is expected to remain stable, supported by strong demand in Asia, while in the U.S. resilient production levels and strong competition with coal indicates that our recovery in dry gas drilling activity continues to be pushed out in time. In terms of E&P spend, the second half of this year is unfolding in line with expectations. Visibility of 2014 is still limited, as our customers are in their planning process. but at this stage, we foresee a continuation of the overall trend seen in 2013, which should yield another year of steady activity growth. In this environment, our entire organization continues to focus on both new technology sales and the quality and efficiency of our execution. In parallel with our ongoing operations, we are actively pursuing our internal transformation programs focused on leveraging the size of our operations and the breadth of our offering and with a clear goal of further elevating our performance in terms of top line growth, margin expansion and cash generation. That concludes my remarks. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Paal. John, we’ll now open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We do ask in your time, if you can please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. First, we go to James West with Barclays. Please go ahead.
James Carlyle West – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning, James.
James Carlyle West – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Paal, clearly good progress in your strong momentum in the international markets, I know you touched on kind of how the year should end up here in case some broad guidance reports. I was hoping you could dig in a little bit further on 2014 and just give us your view of, we had obviously – we’re going to have strong growth this year, probably low double-digit growth internationally on E&P spending, do you think that’s going to be kind of steady, more the same, is it going to accelerate or is there potential for some slowdown in the E&P spending?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, as I mentioned, James, in my prepared remarks, I think it’s still early to comment on specific numbers on what the international growth is going to be next year, but as I said, the – from where we stand today, I think a continuation of the trends that we’ve seen this year is our most likely bet. That means reasonable growth in the spend levels, but that the market dynamics that we play in will continue to see steady activity growth, but competitive basic pricing. But as along as we can get a premium for new technology and the quality of our execution, we are comfortable that we can continue to generate solid incremental margins without a inflection in the pricing.
James Carlyle West – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood, okay and then just a quick follow-up from me. On the international markets, you mentioned Russia is one that looks to be good for 2014. What other kind of key large markets are you looking at to drive this growth?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would probably name the same five that as I’ve been talking about throughout this year. So that’s basically…
James Carlyle West – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure.
Paal Kibsgaard: …Russia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, with particular focus on both Saudi Arabia and Iraq, but UAE, we have also gained significant share in recent quarters and I see the UAE also to be a strong growth driver in 2014, and then, in addition, China and Australia, as we talked about again this year.
James Carlyle West – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And next we go to line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets LLC:
 :
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I can only speak for us, but I would say that we still have upside in terms of the operational efficiency of how we conduct our business, which we show with the activation or basically creation of four additional fleets out of the existing asset base that is currently in operation. So yes, at least for us, I would say that in general it would take us most likely longer to consume the overcapacity we have, unless we gain significant share to the point that we choose to activate some other fleets that we have in the idle asset program as well. But as of now, we are continuing to focus in on the operational efficiencies of the assets we have in operation, and if we can get decent incremental margins on additional work that we potentially take on, we will primarily look to create fleets out of assets currently in operation before we look to the idle asset program.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets LLC: So from your standpoint, then if I were to – and if I understand what you’re saying correctly that irrespective of the excess capacity in a marketplace that may exist or may continue to exist, given your internal drivers, you feel very confident about your ability to get margin improvement?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, in the pressure pumping business, not dramatically right, because pricing is actually still going down, but as long as we can offset that with new technology and operational efficiency, there is potential to get some improvement in margins in pressure pumping, but obviously what helps our margin as well is a strong offshore business and also a good drilling and characterization business on land, where the pricing pressures have been less than what we’ve seen in the pressure pumping.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, great. And then my follow-up question would be in the context of the level of optimism that you expressed in your commentaries here on the call and in the written commentary, how do you feel about the progression from an earning standpoint. I think the Street has tended to get out in front of itself a little bit too much and put you guys in a tough position where you had to hog numbers down, how do you feel about the earnings progression as it sits right now, as you head into 2013 and even more importantly into 2014?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if we started looking at Q4 first, as you know, we do not give guidance, but I would say a couple of things about the fourth quarter. Firstly; that the fundamentals of our business remains intact going into Q4, but there are some seasonal effects that I think everyone should factor in. On the negative side of these effects is that we are likely to or we will see seasonal slowdown in some of our highest growth markets this year such as Russia and China, which will have an impact. We’ll see the normal seasonal slowdown in Marine Seismic and we also expect to see some impact from the holiday season in North America. While on the positive side, we have the year-end product sales, which will offset some of this. But overall, if I look where the current consensus for Q4 is now, I would say it’s about right. Now looking into 2014, obviously very early to look at specific EPS targets, other than that; again, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our overall target is going to be to continue to deliver double-digit growth in earnings per share, and that will be for the fourth year in a row.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, great. Paal, I appreciate it. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from David Anderson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Anderson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. So Paal, you’ve been highlighting the new efficiency and reliability efforts that you’ve been implementing throughout the organization. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how this has already attributed to margin improvement, specifically, as I kind of look at Europe, Africa, CIS margins. Over last two years, you’ve gone from mid-teens to low 20s now and Middle East margins kind of took a step up. Could you talk a little bit about how much of that was due to these efficiency efforts that you have in place and how much is left in there do you think over the next couple of years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say that the progression we have shown in these operating areas over the past year is partly down to very strong management focus on managing both working capital and costs in general, so that on basic activity growth without pricing, we can generate quite significant incremental margins. So our transformation programs are looking at some structural changes to how we are set up and how we conduct and run our business. I would say that there is not a significant part of these structural changes that have taken place so far. So a lot of what we are doing now is just managing with particular focus on driving both cash flow and incremental margins, and that overtime, we will see more of the impact of these structural changes as part of the transformation. So there is little structural changes impact on our results as of yet.
David Anderson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, in other words, even without pricing, you should still see margins continue to improve in eastern hemisphere?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, that's what we're going to work towards, yes.
David Anderson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. Okay. On the U.S. side, I was just curious you talked a lot about the technology and particularly on the perforation clusters. I think in the release, you had talked about Whiting. I was just curious if you could kind of compare and contrast the E&Ps versus the majors in the resource plays that you are working in. It seems to us like the E&Ps are a lot closer towards the true development phase whereas the majors are a little bit further behind. I’m just curious in terms of technology that you are talking about. Are we talking more of your conservation of the E&P side or are the majors kind of sitting back watching and then will implement this later? How do you see this playing out?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think generally, we talked to all of our customers about these things. So I don't see a huge difference between what the independents do and what the IOCs do in this market space, right. I mean, it's all about the acreage, the challenges and the main focus and priorities that they have. So we are openly discussing the whole range of capabilities and new ideas and innovations that we have with all our customers and I can't really separate I would say who is doing what. I think they are all eager to look at what can be done better and the way they are implementing obviously varies depending on what their priorities are.
David Anderson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next we go to Bill Herbert with Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.
Bill A. Herbert – Simmons & Co.:
,:
Paal Kibsgaard:
 :
 – :
Bill A. Herbert – Simmons & Co.: Okay and I think you mentioned that one of your objectives along with these internal transformational initiatives was to get back to prior cycle consolidated operating margins, which I think for something like 26% to 27% thereabouts. You are 20% today on a consolidated basis. Over what timeframe should we expect that evolution to take place roughly?
Paal Kibsgaard: But I’m not going to give you a timeframe here. I mean, we have a horizon of these transformation objectives of plus, minus five years. Exactly when we’re going to hit or if we’re going to hit this targets is too early to say, but we set out quite an ambitious target and that is to get back to previous cycle operating margins and I’m still optimistic and relatively confident that we are going to get there.
Bill A. Herbert – Simmons & Co.: Okay, and last one from me. Recently Total came out at its Analyst Day and announced a fairly significant reduction in capital spending over the next two years. And we’ve sort of talked about this before, I mean, the IOCs in deepwater, NOCs are cash flow constrained and it tend on the one hand an opportunity rich on the other hand. So two questions in that particular regard; one, the outlook for seismic and two the outlook for deepwater capital spending in terms of rate of change going forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, that’s a lot of questions wrapped into one. But I’ll – let us start up with the seismic, so maybe I’d say a little bit about our seismic results in Q3 and then on the outlook and then we can go on to the next part of your question right. But Q3 results gross were solid, multi-client was down a bit about 9% sequentially, which was in line with our expectations. In marine, we had a good quarter as expected, fully booked, good pricing from the new technology, but really no further traction on basic pricing and also on land, we had a very good quarter. We have restructured our land business over the past year, focusing now entirely on Unique deployed in Middle East and North Africa and we are now generating very solid operating margins on land, which is as long time since we’ve done. Now in terms of the outlook for seismic, as you can see from our disclosure, our backlog is now at $856 million, which is down 12% year-over-year, but this backlogging includes all four parts of our business; the marine, the land, the data processing and the multi-client. So actually the main driver for the year-over-year growth in the backlog is actually land, and that’s basically due to the fact that we have downsized our business and focusing more narrowly on Unique and Middle East and North Africa. So the marine backlog was slightly up year-over-year, but the visibility on Q1, Q2 is lower than what we had at the same stage last year. It doesn’t mean that there are no surveys out there, but our customers are now in their planning cycle and they have been reluctant to make early commitment as to these surveys that they have on the table. So I would say that we basically expect to gain further visibility on marine seismic activity during the fourth quarter. So there is a bit of uncertainty over that as of now, but I can’t really conclude what that’s going to mean for next year. So overall, the outlook for seismic, for data processing, land and multi-client looks solid, with some lower visibility on marine. Now in terms of deepwater, there is – we’re still quite, I would say, bullish and optimistic on deepwater. There are a number of new rigs coming into the market in Q4 and also going into 2014 and that’s going to grow – that’s going to drive the deepwater spend in 2014. So we’re still optimistic on deepwater.
Bill A. Herbert – Simmons & Co.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Our next question is from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole H. Slorer – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And thanks for that. Paal, I wonder whether you could elaborate a little bit more on what you said on the efficiencies in North America pressure pumping market. Your pitch sounded a little bit increased productivity from the well and reducing the number of stages needed, sounded pretty much like the picture on introduction of highway a little while back. Is it something more than highway gaining foothold?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I think highway is one technology that obviously has applications in the market. As I’ve been saying over the past year or so, we continue to work on other technologies as well. So there is – while highway increases conductivity in the fractures that we create, this new technology I talked about today, the diversion technology, has a different objective, which is basically to ensure that we access all the perforation clusters along the horizontal section, which the industry basically today does not do. So it’s another technology, which in conjunction or in parallel with highway can help to drive production and reduce costs.
Ole H. Slorer – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. thanks for clarifying. Also on Framo, well, did you account for anything at all this quarter or is it the one quarter delay on how you report the equity income?
Simon Ayat: Ole, Simon here. We reported on one-month lag, but it is – we didn’t report anything during this quarter from Framo. So…
Ole H. Slorer – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So that would have added a couple of cents.
Simon Ayat: Quarter-to-quarter, it’s basically in Q2, we have Framo and in the third quarter, it is part of the venture and it will be reported by the OneSubsea as they consolidate in Cameron.
Ole H. Slorer – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.
Simon Ayat: What did you say, Ole?
Ole H. Slorer – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: No, that – that’s clear. Thanks for clarifying.
Operator: Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie M. Sedita – UBS Securities LLC: Good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Angie M. Sedita – UBS Securities LLC: Morning. On the North America market, clearly your strength in technology and execution have led to very impressive efficiencies and you noted the deployment of additional frac crews in the U.S. Do you think – on existing equipment and not using capital, which I think is very interesting, do you think you will be able to continue this in 2014, where in essence, you are adding additional frac crews into the market without adding any and or on-stacking any capacity or adding any capital?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, we don’t plan to add any capital in 2014 based on where we stand now. So if we – it’s all going to be a function of the amount of works that we will win and the first priority will be to try to address that work through the equipment we already have deployed. and beyond that, we are prepared to activate assets from the idle asset program, if we cannot address the work with the assets already in operation. but I think there is still upside in terms of the efficiency and utilization of the assets we already have in operation.
Angie M. Sedita – UBS Securities LLC: Great, fair enough, and then as a follow-up to that, clearly, you are seeing significant efficiency gains through execution on the pressure pumping side. Are there other product lines outside of pressure pumping that are particularly apps to be able to drive additional product efficiencies through execution or are there specific regions that you think you could see more of it as you go into 2014 internationally?
Simon Ayat: Well, internationally, we continue to drive efficiency through other operations, right. There is no one item that I would single out. I think every product line that we have, all 15 of them, have specific programs and targets where they drive both the efficiency of our workforce as well as the utilization of our assets in all aspects of our operations. So, that's a key part of what you see in terms of the incremental margins that we are generating in the international market.
Angie M. Sedita – UBS Securities LLC: Great. I'll turn it over.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go to Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
William D. Sanchez – Howard Weil Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I just had one question as it relates to your longer term outlook on Brazil. I know you hadn't always felt like this would be kind of a transition year in the contrary and you remarked 4Q you see activity flat versus third quarter which was down. Can you just give us your more longer term thoughts on Brazil as a whole and how we should expect that unfolding for Schlumberger here next year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I would say that, our view on 2014 overall in Brazil is that it’s going to be another challenging year. And it's mainly down to the activity levels that we see at this stage, which is relatively flat from where we stand now. That's a function of obviously of what Petrobras is planning to do, but also there is some impact in this in lower activity projected for both the Brazilian independents as well as on the IOCs in Brazil in 2014. 2015 is likely to be higher when the exploration work linked to the last license round is likely to kick in, but the majority of the activity in Brazil next year for us is going to be centered around Petrobras who are not looking to significantly grow activity at least from what we can see at this stage.
William D. Sanchez – Howard Weil Inc.: Okay. And for you, you feel like you are pretty well balanced in terms of service and equipment capacity in Brazil?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. We are we well set up in Brazil. We have a strong focus on both quality and efficiency and also introduction of new technology for these long-term contracts. So I’m comfortable with our position and our set up in Brazil, it is challenging, but we are executing well.
William D. Sanchez – Howard Weil Inc.: Okay. And that was it from me. I’ll turn it back. Thank you.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael Kirk LaMotte – Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning guys. I wanted to follow-up Paal on the transformation program and in particular ask you about some of the metrics we can be looking at over the next five years. We tend to focus on top line growth and incremental margins and obviously the margins should improve and you’ve given some good guidance there. But if I think about capital efficiency, can you give us some sense as to where you think ratios such as reinvestment rates, CapEx to revenue, asset turnover, some of the key utilization metrics that might better reflect the doubling of asset utilization and some of the other elements of the program?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I mean, I would reiterate the main indicators that I gave you during my talk in this conference in Q3. We are aiming at doubling asset utilization, which by itself means that we should be able to reduce the CapEx relative to activity in terms of growth going forward. So I’m not going to give you a specific CapEx as a percentage of revenue , other than that, we reduce CapEx in 2013 while we were still growing and my initial, I would say, indication for 2014 would be flat to slightly down on CapEx and that is assuming that we are still going to grow in 2014. So the focus on asset utilization should help us reduce CapEx relative to growth going forward.
Michael Kirk LaMotte – Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. And then one other point on the financial focus areas, you mentioned cross training of the workforce particularly in remote areas. I'm wondering what that means in terms of new recruitment and thinking about training of – cross training or existing employees as appose to the recruitment program, university program, et cetera and overall headcount growth?
Paal Kibsgaard: Right. So, we are not looking in the near-term to change significantly the level of recruiting, because this all cross training and ensuring that we got proper competencies for the people that we do cross train is going to take a little bit of time. So, in the near-term, there is no change, no significant change to the level of recruiting that we are planning to do.
Michael Kirk LaMotte – Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go to Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brad Handler – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Simon Ayat: Morning.
Brad Handler – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: I guess Paal in your comments you’ve spoken optimistically, bullishly about deepwater development, I understand that and we are looking at the rigs coming in and perhaps thinking similarly. I guess I'm curious if you have pause related to a couple of the events that seem to be at least percolating, I guess of anecdotally, which is in the Gulf of Mexico a bit of swapping out of new in place of older rigs even if they're still deepwater, even if they're still BP. And there perhaps in West Africa and Angola and Nigeria it seems like it's a bit of a backlog in terms of getting some of those rigs signed and under contract. So I guess I’m curious for your thoughts about that. And I imagine you're calibrating that into your comments, but I guess I'm curious if that gives you pause if there is an element where you are a little less encouraged perhaps, because of those kinds of developments?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I’m aware that some of the new arrivals that are coming into the market in 2014 still do not have contracts. But based on what we are hearing from the drilling contractors, they appear confident that these rigs are going to get contracts by the time they arrive. To the other point that you are making, yes maybe some of the older generation rigs will be replaced by the newer generation. But either way, we have a positive view on the market. There were significant growth in deepwater drilling activity in 2011 and we expect the continuation on that trend into 2014.
Brad Handler – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Fair enough. Okay. An unrelated question, you mentioned in you’re – the written commentary about Statoil, a couple of nice multi-year contracts, I guess on the fluid side as well as cementing. I think that there are one or if not more of those contracts still outstanding. I wonder if you could speak to us about the lay of the land there if you expect there are some awards that might still come and if you can at all calibrate if the implications for you given the fact that you've won the ones that you've announced?
Paal Kibsgaard: You’re talking about Statoil Norway?
Brad Handler – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I'm not aware of any major outstanding contracts beyond the ones that we have – that's already been awarded earlier this year as well as the ones that we are referencing now. But I would say overall our position in Norway and our position with Statoil is strong from where we see it and we're well positioned there.
Brad Handler – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Very good, okay, thanks. I’ll turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go to Robin Shoemaker with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.
Robin E. Shoemaker – Citi Investment Research: Thank you. So, Paal, could you give us idea now of what percentage of your fracturing stages are employing the leading edge technologies such as Highway and this recent innovation that you mentioned on the diversion of perforation clusters. I mean what kind of percentage are we talking about here of total stages fracked?
Paal Kibsgaard: So, we haven't disclosed what percentage of stages are done with highway. The only thing I would say is that we have seen continuous growth in Highway stages throughout this year and the year-over-year growth is very significant as well. So, we continue to penetrate the market on highway. But we haven't been disclosing what percentage of our own stages we are doing highway on. And on the other technology I referenced, this is the technology that is in field test. So, it is very limited what the deployment is and it's not yet commercialized. So, I would say that this is something that we are trying out. There is still a fair bit of field testing done before we are potentially going to commercialize it. But I wanted to share with you this technology, because it is interesting and the early field test results are showing great promise.
Robin Shoemaker – Citi Investment Research: Okay. And just staying on that theme, you had mentioned in some of your earlier kind of outlines of the evolution of highway and other fracking technologies that you could eventually come to a point where you might not be necessarily providing the fracturing fleets themselves, but more providing technology for the fracking operations. Is there any – how far have we advanced towards that possible goal and is it in the foreseeable future?
Paal Kibsgaard: What you are referencing is what we call this Spark model this is basically where we provide the fracturing fluid, the engineering, the blending while we have a third-party providing the horsepower. So we have deployed this business model with a number of customers who are vertically integrated in North America, but the overall business volume is I would say is not significant but it's continued to grow this year from where it was last year when we introduced it. And similarly, we have also deployed this business model for part of our operations in China.
Robin Shoemaker – Citi Investment Research: I see, okay. Thanks very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: We will go to Waqar Syed with Goldman, Sachs. Please go ahead.
Waqar Syed – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Paal just following upon highway are there any particular basins in the North America where highway has had the best penetration and could you outline which ones are those?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I would say the basin where we have had the most success and where the penetration is the deepest is in the Eagle Ford. So we have a significant number of wells and stages down there over the past couple of years and also I think a fair bit of data indicating the results that highway can bring both in terms of higher production and recovery and lower cost in terms of pumping less propane.
Waqar Syed – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Now is it something to do with the geology of the basin or the structure of the formation or this technology is applicable in or effective in every basin?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well generally, we believe its applicable in every basin I think what you find is that there are two main applications of highway. One is to increase conductivity so you thereby increase production and recovery. And the other one is that you reduce cost because in general we pump about 40% less [propant] per job which is a cost saving. So, what we found that is that in Eagle Ford, we have both a significant production recovery increase together with the cost savings. While the production increases we have not seen the same level of production increases in some of the other basins, which is partly down to the geology as you reference it right. But in general we have not seen – we've always seen I would say a flat or higher production and we generally always see lower costs. So it's just a matter of the technology uptake taking a bit of time when you look at a large market like North America land.
Waqar Syed – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Sure. And then just on, in terms of your efficiency improvements how they are having an impact on the margins, could you quantify for us what the margin impact has been in North America because of these efforts. And if you didn't have those efforts where the margins would have been?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I can't really give you a number on that. I mean, the efficiency improvements going all the way back three years to when we started restructuring the land business is obviously a key part of the performance that we continue to post quarter-after-quarter. But at the same time, we have a very strong offshore business both in Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Canada and we also have a very strong business in Alaska. So it’s a combination of everything where we needed to improve the most going back three years was in North America land and there has been a significant improvement there. But at the same time, we have continued to progress on our offshore and high-end business as well.
Waqar Syed – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go to Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jim K. Wicklund – Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning guys.
Paal Kibsgaard: Good morning.
Jim K. Wicklund – Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Paal geographically and product lines, your incrementals are through the roof and that's fabulous. Where geographically and what product lines typically generate the highest incrementals?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think if you are talk about international market, I think we had great results basically in all regions, I would say takeaway Latin America at this stage in terms of incrementals right. We managed to keep margins flat in Latin America in a very challenging business environment and mainly driven by the headwinds or challenges in Brazil and Mexico while the business in the other countries in Latin America progressed very well. So the incremental margins were driven by ECA and the Middle East and the Far East. In terms of product lines, obviously characterization continues to do well. I mean their incremental margins were not as high this quarter but they have been progressing very well year-over-year and so far this year. But both drilling and production continues to do very well. So I can't really single out one specific product line internationally other than that all of them are doing very well and together they come together extremely well.
Jim K. Wicklund – Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. My follow-up, if I could, is Brazil has been a difficult year for everybody this year and it maybe next year. What percentage of your Latin American revenues generally come from Brazil these days with the contract wins you have?
Paal Kibsgaard: We haven't disclosed that. So I’m not going to...
Jim K. Wicklund – Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Is it your biggest market in Latin America?
Paal Kibsgaard: It’s not our biggest market in Latin America.
Jim K. Wicklund – Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll go to Holm Turner with RS Platou Markets. Please go ahead.
Holm Turner – RS Platou Markets AS: Yes. Hi, guys. Just a question on the operational delays that you had in this quarter. It sounds like much of that came in offshore Africa, I was just curious if you could give us a bit more color on that. Was the delayed in new builds coming out of the yards or was it more on the operator side? and related to that, do you think you can get most of that work back in 4Q and if so, maybe see a bit stronger sequential progression that you would typically expect seasonally?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think the Q2 operational delays was really the sum of all the things you mentioned. Some of the rigs delayed coming from the yard, then you've got to commission them and get them started off and then it's having everything ready from the customer side to start operations. Right. So no one thing impacting it. But there was a significant planned influx of rigs and there were delays with several aspects of it which is not uncommon for these types of markets. In terms of Q4, there will be some improvement in Q4, but I think it's going to go into Q1, Q2 before everything is ironed out.
Holm Turner – RS Platou Markets AS: Yes. Okay, alright. And just to change gears a little bit. I was just wondering if you could comment on the growth in the Arctic market. There is a lot of things going on there, you have Exxon Rosneft kicking off a drilling campaign in the Kara Sea next year, there is increasing activity in the Norwegian side of the barrens and talk of doing some work on the Russian side and of course there is Cairn and Greenland and also some Alaska work. So just curious if you can talk about the opportunity in the Arctic in terms of service intensity and sort of your expectation for how quickly that market can become significant for Schlumberger?
Paal Kibsgaard: That's a good question. I think we see Arctic as a interesting market and a good opportunity going forward. We are, I think, very well positioned to take part in that in particularly in Russia, we're already involved in one Arctic project there Prirazlomnaya. At the same time we are also actively pursuing the other projects that are coming up both in, like to say, Greenland as well as other places in Russia and North America and Norway. So in terms of overall impact and activity, I think it's going to take a bit of time before it becomes really material. But there is a significant potential there that we are going to actively position ourselves to take part in.
Holm Turner – RS Platou Markets AS: Okay. Thanks. And last other thing is that, your two largest competitors talking about sort of 10% E&P spending growth next year in North America. Would you kind of echo that sentiment? And if so, I was just curious if you’re position in the Gulf of Mexico would give you the expectation that you might grow a bit faster than whatever the E&P spending comes in, in North America next year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, like I said earlier in my prepared remarks, I think it's too early to comment on specific growth numbers for any part of the world next year, given the fact that our customers are still in their planning cycle. I am optimistic though that we'll see growth in North America in terms of spend next year and potentially higher than what we saw this year. But beyond that I’m not ready to give you a number at this stage.
Holm Turner – RS Platou Markets AS: Okay. All right, thanks guys. I'll turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Please go ahead.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon and good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2013 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.15. This is an increase of $0.18 sequentially and is $0.14 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we completed the wind down of our operations in Iran and as a result we have now classified this business as a discontinued operations. All prior period amounts have been restated. As previously disclosed, we completed the formation of our OneSubsea joint venture with Cameron prior to the end of the quarter. We recognized $1 billion gain in connection with this transaction which equates to $0.77 in terms of EPS. We also recorded $0.26 of charges relating to the impairment of drilling related equity investments. From an operational perspective, we had a very strong quarter. Oilfield services second quarter revenue of $11.2 billion increased 5.8% sequentially, pretax operating income increased 15.9% sequentially while the pretax operating margin improved 178 basis points to 20.4%. Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3 billion increased 9.6% and pretax income grew by over 25%. This resulted in margins improving by 380 basis points to 30.1%. This growth was driven by very strong performance in both Wireline and WesternGeco combined with the seasonal rebound in SIS software sales and maintenance. Drilling group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 4.4% and margins improved by 97 basis points to 18.7%. These increases were largely attributable to the Drilling and Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust international activity. Production group revenue of $3.9 billion increased 4.4% while the pretax income increased 12.6%. This resulted in margin expansion of 116 basis points to 15.9%. Growth was led by Well Services as a strong performance internationally and in US land more than compensation for the impact of the spring break-up in Canada. Completions and one intervention were also significant contributors to the growth. Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 23.3% in the second quarter compared to 23.8% in the previous quarter. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2013 to be in the mid 20s, hwoever, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business. Yesterday, our board of directors approved the new $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest June 30, 2018. Our strong projected cash flow over the next five years allows us to increase the level of share buybacks while also maintaining enough flexibility to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities. Let me take this opportunity to remind you how we manage our cash flow. Our first priority is to reinvest into the business to drive growth. We do this through CapEx and the investment we make in R&D and future revenue streams. From a dividend perspective, over the past 10 years, we have increased our dividend on average by 13% per year. We will continue to review this on an annual basis with our board. After that, we will continue to be strategic when it comes to M&A, then the balance will be spent on stock buybacks. For the first six months of this year, we have generated $3.4 billion of cash flow from operations. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion as compared to $5.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $906 million of CapEx, $600 million payment to Cameron for the OneSubsea transaction and $500 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $6.84 million shares at an average price of $73.7. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.9 billion as compared to the $4.7 billion we spent in 2012. Now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Our second quarter results were strong as international activity recorded significant progress and North American results benefitted from solid execution in land and increasing deployment of new technology in deepwater areas. Sequentially, revenue was up 6%. Margins expanded by 178 basis points, which together yielded a 16% growth in operating income. Compared to the same quarter last year, operating income was up 12%. The results were driven by solid activity levels in all our main markets as well market share gains for a number of our product lines on the back of new technology sales and our strong execution and integration capabilities. I am pleased with the overall results and even more so with the consistency in our business performance throughout the company seen, for instance, in the margin levels of our four main operating areas, which are all at or above 20%. The focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution is also reflected in our incremental margins, which were north of 50%, sequentially, as well as the cash flow from operations which was $2.3 billion driven by both, improving asset utilization and reduction in the use of working capital. The strength in our international business was again evident in the second quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 12% and margin expansion of 173 basis points to reach 22%, making up over 70% of the operating income of the quarter. Activity and customer plans confirmed our expectations for the year in all our major growth markets, while revenue per rig continued to steadily increase as a function of new technology sales, increased integration related activity and a favorable business mix. Our ability to consistently execute remains critical in the international market and is a driver for both, our market share gains and superior margin performance. While we continue to replace competition on contracts where they are unable to deliver, we are becoming more and more selective in terms of where and when we do so. In Latin America, the revenue was flat, sequentially, despite a 2% drop in rig count, while margins increased 107 basis points to 20.6%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 3%, while margin expanded 153 basis points. Our Latin America business showed commendable resiliency this quarter by maintaining laser focus on execution, technology sales and cost control overcoming both, activity headwinds and new contract mobilizations and startups. In Mexico with the third big round for production intensive contracts was concluded where we ended up bidding for only one of the six blocks. Drilling activity remained soft in the North and East regions of the country following the budget shifts announced in the first quarter. In Venezuela we signed a new agreement with PDVSA and we are now in the process of ramping up our activity in the country while payments are on plan. Elsewhere in Latin America, the Shushufindi SCM project in Ecuador is progressing well with production levels well above the agreed targets. While, in Argentina, we continue to be active in reservoir studies and well side operations relating to Vaca Muerta shale development. In Brazil, we continued to mobilize resources during the quarter for the new contract signed with Petrobras although overall activity levels were down sequentially. We have several new IPM projects starting in the second half of the year, however the overall activity level is expected to remain flat to slightly down for the rest of the year. Overall, our outlook for Latin America remains unchanged with 2013 being a transition year in terms of activity for the region and we remain comfortable with our position, our plans as well as the actions we have taken to handle the somewhat challenging business environment. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew 11% sequentially on a 3% rig count increase while margins increased 178 basis points to 24.6%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 28% while margins were up by 330 basis points. In the Middle East growth was again spearheaded by Saudi Arabia and Iraq but our United Arab Emirates and Oman geo markets also posted strong results. Common to all there markets is that we have gained noticeable share in the past quarters. Our business in Saudi Arabia continues to grow through a diverse portfolio of projects on both land and offshore and driven by both drilling and rigless activity. In Iraq, we have on the back on an unmatched execution track record built up a significant business that is now starting to yield excellent results. Activity levels continue to increase both in the North and in the South of the country and with our business footprint and contract portfolio, we have clear leadership in what is shaping up to be a very interesting market for us. Asia also contributed strongly to the area results by delivering a record revenue in four geo markets driven by robust market share and new technology sales. China led the Asia growth on a rebound from seasonally low land drilling and simulation activity in the previous quarter and also helped by an upswing in offshore activities. We also posted very strong in Australia, driven by continued growth in unconventional activity on land as well as offshore and deepwater activity in the Northwest and Papa New Guinea. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was up 10% sequentially and margins increased 275 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 7% while margins increased 33 basis points. As expected, Russia led the growth in the second quarter as the high volume land as well as the offshore business entered the most active phase of the calendar year. EMP investments and activity levels in the country remained very strong in terms of offshore and land activity as well as for exploration and development and Russia will be one of our fastest growing markets in 2013. In the North Sea, WesternGeco saw strong activity as the seismic acquisition season started while the offshore drilling rig count stayed more or less flat. In North Africa, rig activity in Nigeria started to rebound following the security incident in the first quarter while rig activity in Libya remained flat due to delays and ongoing security challenges. In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity in the Gulf of Guinea as well as in East Africa was robust. On the other hand, activity in Angola was subdued in the second quarter due to project delays. However, the activity outlook for the second half of the year remained strong driven by both exploration and development projects. In North America, revenue was up 2% sequentially while margins increased 65 basis points to reach 19.7%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were flat while margins were down 83 basis. In the North America land market, the rig count dropped 14% sequentially driven by the Canada breakup and also impacted by the June flooding in Alberta. While the downwards pricing trend in U.S. land continued in the areas of drilling, simulation and wireline, although this slowed in pace during the quarter. However, continued strong drilling efficiency, resulting in solid growth in horizontal wells and frac stages completed partly offset these headwinds. Looking at our land performance we continue to execute very well in our product lines and we also see a gradual improvement in the uptake of our new shale technologies throughout the characterization, drilling and production groups. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater rig count is now 17% above pre-Macondo levels and on a year-over-year basis activity has increased by 30%. The call for reliable and efficient service delivery in addition to risk mitigation technologies continues in this growing market and is yielding very strong result for a number of a higher margin and higher market share product lines. In addition to the Dual Coil fleet operating in the Gulf of Mexico, WesternGeco also started isometrics operation in Eastern Canada during the quarter. Turning next to technology. During the quarter, we closed the OneSubsea joint venture with Cameron and the JC is now operational. Cameron, with its long history of innovation and firsts in the subsea market is an industry leader in design capability, manufacturing excellence and successful installations. In addition to this, Schlumberger brings a deep understanding of the reservoir as well as industry-leading well completions, subsea processing and integration capabilities. Through the combination of these strengths, OneSubsea will offer best-in-class subsea solutions optimizing the complete subsea production system and helping our customers improve production and recovery from their subsea development. In other areas, we saw growing customer interest in a number of our new or recently commercialized technologies. In Wireline, the Saturn 3D fluid sampling probe is enjoying one of the most rapidly growing deployments of new formation of our technology for a number of years. Its ability to acquire reliable pressures and high quality samples in difficult reservoirs has been impressive. Reservoir Characterization, the SIS Studio Manager software, which went from concept to market release in only eight months is enabling and increasing number of customer geoscientists to access data, collaborate with peers and share best practices within [partout] workflows. Within the Drilling Group, new and innovative drillbit technologies recorded significant progress. Drillbits equipped with Stinger conical diamond elements that add stability and improved drilling speed have now made more than 650 runs in North America alone since their introduction in the first quarter and have achieved an average improvement of 15% in rates of penetration. In the second quarter, we commercialized the ONYX 360 rotating cutters that we believe will lead to dramatic improvements in different lengths in abrasive formations. Lastly, at the Production Group, joint deployment of LIVE slickline with ACTive coiled-tubing services demonstrated clear benefits in the efficiency and effectiveness of our well intervention services both, on land and offshore, and units were active in the quarter in both, Latin America and the Middle East. Let's now turn to the macro environment, where the business outlook for 2013 has remained largely unchanged since April as expansion in the global economy remained soft. In summary, the U.S. has shown little or no impact of the financial sequester. The Eurozone is still in a two-year recession although the risk of any concrete to leave the monitor union appears reduced. And, recent Chinese data have been mixed with the outlook for long and progressive soft landing remaining unchanged. The oil market picture is also largely unchanged. The market is more comfortably supplied than it was in 2012, but spare capacity remains below pre- Libya conflict levels. The year-on-year increase in North American supply is enough to face both, increasing global demand and the production declined in other non-OPEC producing countries. The call on OPEC remains unchanged and is in line with the group's production target of 30 million barrels per day. Overall, the market continues to support Brent prices over $100 per barrel. For natural gas, the apparent rebalancing of the U.S. market is still fragile as gas production remained steady and as the power sector has already switched back to coal in some regions on higher gas prices. Internationally, Asian LME prices eased on weaker Chinese demand trends, but remained close to oil parity. While in Europe regional supply declined from the North Sea and very cold weather supported highest spot prices. Despite the overall slow progress in the economic environment, the latest releases of the third-party E&P spending surveys, so offer durations of upstream CapEx estimates making 2013 the fourth consecutive year of double-digit worldwide gains driven by the international and offshore investments notably in the Middle East and Asia regions, while the North American spending remained flat to slightly up. These estimates are further confirmed by the recon outlook that shows double-digit growth in a number of both shallow water and deepwater rigs active worldwide and a 6% growth in the international land rig count in 2013. In this market, we continue to focus on [key] control, which is the quality, efficiency and integration aspects of our operational execution. Through this focus, which permeates our entire organization, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver tangible results today as can be seen by our revenue market share gains, unmatched operating margins, strong cash flow and consistent double-digit growth in earnings per share. We also remain confident in the outlook of the industry, in our strategic position within the markets we operate in an in our ability to further improve all aspects of our performance going forward, which remains the overarching objective of the entire Schlumberger team. That concludes my remarks. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Paal. Greg, we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Good afternoon where you are. A question, Paal, for you on the North American market. You continue to show some differential performance on the margin front despite the fact that and show improvement in terms of activity, revenue and margins despite an anemic rate progression and a lot of discussion here about the well count and so on. So I was just wondering if you can us a little bit of additional color as to what product lines that you see will be benefitting from the shift in the type of drilling that’s taking place in the U.S. marketplace and what kind technologies that Schlumberger has that will continue to enable Schlumberger to share differential margin performance going forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think if you look at what enables to show differentiated margins, I think its several things. Firstly, our ability to execute very well on land, whether that is on drilling or on pressure pumping but also the fact that we have a very well balanced portfolio in between drilling and production related activities on land as well as in between land and offshore. So we honestly have a very strong offshore business both rig related as well as seismic but what we have done in recent years is, starting off in 2001 was to restructure the business on land which in previous years, I would say, had underperformed and through that restructuring, I think, we are performing on par with the best if not better in most of our product lines. So if you look at the trends of drilling, in the North America land market now going towards more and more horizontal wells, predominantly focused on liquids, all our drilling segments obviously benefit from that. At the same time, our pressure pumping business through new technology deployments such as HiWAY are also benefiting from this. We also introducing to the market our own multistage completion technology, which has been a gap in our portfolio in recent years which also should enjoy quite significant growth going forward. So I think it’s a good balance between land and offshore, good balance between drilling and production on land and overall a very strong focus on execution.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: And as a follow-up on that, with respect to the overall margin performance of Schlumberger, especially in the international marketplace, are you getting any sense that we are starting to see a shift in the industry that will demonstrate Schlumberger's relative product and services strength, whether its deepwater or otherwise? Do you think whether that kind of an inflection point in the marketplace or we are going to see these strengths of Schlumberger?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at our margin performance in international over the past couple of years, I think we have been highly differentiated continuously, right. So I think we have done well in our contracts strategy, what contracts we are prepared to take on and the ones that we see more as must wins. We have continuously introduced new technology and we are also leveraging very well, I think our overall size and infrastructure. So to your question, whether its an inflection, we don’t see any imminent inflection in big pricing at this stage. We are seeing a continuous uptick in another pricing indicator that we track which is revenue per rig. That is continuing to grow and going upwards. That obviously helps our profitability. What drives that up is new technology sales. It is our integration capabilities where we do more and more services and products on each rig and it is also down to the nature of the work that we take on. Typically take on the more complex and more intense work, because it is more difficult to do. If you perform well in that, that also is quite accretive to margins. So bid pricing, we still don’t see any imminent inflection but we continue to drive revenue per rig upwards through new technology, through integration and there's very solid execution.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays. Please go ahead.
James West - Barclays: You mentioned in your prepared comments, the third party surveys, which of course you are well aware we do a very large survey. And, what we saw when we reran the numbers here in May and in early June was that international spending was creeping up about 300 basis points to 400 basis points. So, curious if you are seeing the same things from your customers who you are having the same post conversation that we are with. Then secondarily, which markets do you agree with what we showed as the biggest growth areas of kind of Middle East, eastern hemisphere in general and which seem like markets that are Schlumberger's backyard essentially. Do you see those as the best growth markets for this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So, to the first part of the question in terms of the spend, yes, if you look at the average of the spend surveys, we look at several. I think for international it was about 9% early in the year, and it was generally all of them revised upwards lately to average about 13%. So, we generally agree with that upwards revision. We see continued strong activity levels in the international market and those spend surveys are also I would say confirmed from the rig count outlook and also the rigless outlook in terms of activity that we have the second half of the year. So, yes, we are in agreement that that upward revision seems to be reasonable. Then second part of your question was?
James West - Barclays: On the specific regions where the spending has increased?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So, we highlighted going into the year five major growth regions, right? So, we said that international would grow north of 10% this year. We would see growth in Latin America, but due to the kind of transitional nature both, in Mexico and Brazil as we indicated earlier in the year, we weren't expecting a lot of growth coming out in Latin America which is being confirmed and we said that the main growth markets would be Sub-Saharan Africa, Russia, Middle East, in particular Saudi and Iraq, China and Australia. Those were the five main drivers. So, basically and ECA and MEA were the main drivers of growth in international market.
James West - Barclays: Okay. Then just a follow-up from me, the market share gains that you also highlighted in your prepared remarks, are those happening in those markets that are going the most rapidly?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think, in general that's fair. I would say in particular in MEA, we are gaining quite good market share.
James West - Barclays: Okay. Great. Thanks Paal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Paal, just a real quick [rig count] about six month behind schedule. Can you concur with that and does that have an impact on kind of your outlook for next 12 months?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at our view on the [rig count], we are still expecting the total rig count both drilling and workover to reach about 170 rigs by the end of 2013 or early 2014, so the rig count evolution in Q2 was flattish, but it is all about when new rigs arrive and how they are commissioned and so forth, but we are still expecting that we will reach the number that we have indicated earlier roughly by the end of the year or early 2014.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Okay. Then I just wanted to make sure you touched on that you can't expect bids from us. I was just curious what was about those contracts that kept away? Was it location, work, was it the contract structure or you guys just holding out for another set of tenders?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, let me just give you a little bit of background on our view on these production incentive contracts. So, we've been very clear about our interest in production incentive contracts, but we also stress the importance of picking the right project with the right terms. So, we evaluated all the 60s offered in the third in Mexico and based on the very detailed technical and commercially valuations we did, we only fund one field interesting. Now we've been at this field at the price that will give us the returns that we require and that is really factoring in the additional risks associated with these contract terms. The winner bid at a fee close to zero fee per barrel and basically we are not interested in doing that, so we did not win it.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Okay. One last quick question on some of the buyback you announced today. Could you just kind of give us a sense on your philosophy on the pace of that buyback? You talked about the cash flow you are generating over next couple of years. Should we expect the majority of that to go towards share repurchase? I heard on some type of broke in terms of the deal but it seems like you have an opportunity here to kind of accelerate that over the next, all it, I don’t know, three or four quarters here. Am I right in my assessment?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. Well, thanks David. As I mentioned in my remark, that the buyback is basically a balancing number for us when it comes to utilization of the cash flow. You are right in your assumption of the cash flow. That's why we said latest by 2018. So as the cash flow proved to be significantly better than what we have factored in the five year scenario in making the $10 billion program, we will accelerate it. We did this in the past. We look at our excess cash over a period of time, taking into consideration the growth that we are anticipating in terms CapEx and as I said investment in future revenue stream activity, be it multi client or production incentive contracts and any balance will go into the buyback. Yes.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey from ISI Group. Please go ahead.
Judson Bailey - ISI Group: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on Mexico, if I could. The first is, that's obviously a big market for you guys. Are you there?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes.
Judson Bailey - ISI Group: I am sorry. Obviously a big market for you guys, pretty-diverse. Pemex still has pretty ambitious growth expectations in next few years. It obviously pulled back activity in the North. I wanted to get your thoughts. They have the lot of tenders coming up and tenders in process and it would look like, you could see pretty strong growth in that market next year. In your view, is there any reason for skepticism that Pemex may be wouldn't follow through or is there else going on down there that would give you some caution in terms of the growth opportunities down in Mexico?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I don't see any reason for that. I do not think Pemex has signaled that there is a number of bids coming out for the remaining part of this year and probably into next year. We are going to actively compete for all of that work and we continue to see Mexico as a very interesting market for us.
Judson Bailey - ISI Group: Okay, all right. Then next question, just on North America. Obviously, very strong margin results factoring in Canada and everything else going on in that market. With the continued growth in the Gulf of Mexico and let's just say that the U.S. landmark, it kind of continues at this methodical pace with very little pricing traction. How should we think about Schlumberger's margins in terms of, we would assume you would get some more market share gains, you would benefit from the very strong Gulf of Mexico and a rebounding Canada? Can you help us think about maybe the near term and the long term margins for the Schlumberger in the North America market?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say that over the past year when there has been significant struggles in the pressure pumping business, I think we have shown commendable margin resilience and again, as I alluded to earlier, it is down to how we execute on land as well as the balance between land and offshore. So in terms of what the margin progression is going to be, the main uncertainty is still what is going to happen in terms of pricing on land. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still saw pricing pressure both in the drilling, stimulation and Wireline product lines in the second quarter but that was slowing somewhat in pace. So assuming that the pricing is reasonably behaved and drilling efficiency continues to be the main activity driver going forward, I would expect us to show continued margin resilience and obviously we are looking to drive up margins in any operating areas. I can't promise you exactly how that’s going to progress but we have a lot of focus on margins in every part of our business and we will continue to look drive it up in North America.
Judson Bailey - ISI Group: All right, great. Thank you Paal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thanks, good morning. Paal, I was wondering if you could sort of reconcile on the one hand for double-digit E&P capital spending growth, not so much for this year but on a structural basis perhaps going forward internationally, and reconcile the tension between on the one hand the increasing need on part of the customer base to reinvest simply to keep production flat and on the other hand increasingly challenged cash flows in a range bound oil pricing burn and rising cost environment. What do you think ultimately happens over the next several years assuming range bound oil prices? Does the rate of E&P capital spending growth decelerate or what happens?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think we are still optimistic about the further need to increase overall E&P spending going forward, right? So, we saw the upward revision for the spend survey this year. And at this stage, although it's early to conclude our next year the customers need to go through their planning process, but we are still optimistic about the initial projections for 2014. The resilience in the spend as you say is linked to partly the working intensity linked to fighting decline, but also due to the overall size and complexity of the projects that are undertaking in particular in the international market. So, I think for the company, for E&P companies that potentially are or will be facing cash flow issues, we expect them to be likely to shift more of the spend within the E&P spend from more infrastructure related projects towards more well CapEx. So that obviously will be good for our business, because that's sort of where we make most of our money on, right? So, I think the general shift from infrastructure towards CapEx is where I expect to happen for those E&P companies that are facing cash flow issues.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Okay. Then secondly switching gears. At the reservoir level, I'm curious as to what your views are with regard to the outlook for U.S. oil production growth, I mean, clearly it's been extremely vigorous. We are up about $1 million barrels per day on a leading edge basis that's 15% to 20% year-over-year, yet I think there is a healthy debate here with regard to the prospects going forward, the prospect of the Bakken growth flattening out and filling their production growths vacuum with other basins, perhaps not as easy as some contend. Where do you fall out with regard to the domestic production outlook going forward stronger for longer, or decelerating or too early to make a case either way?
Paal Kibsgaard: It's a good question. First of all I would say that the overall production increases that we have seen on our North America liquids, they have been very impressive. We always maintained that it's too early to extrapolate the early production trends in terms of how great they see. Also, I think it's too early to conclude on whether the trends we are seeing on the Bakken, is something that is also sustainable, right? For the early production trends, I think we need more information to look at the production of these wells over a longer period of time and I think we also we need to look at the initial rates or the inflow performance for the wells that the operators are started to drill outside of the fairway, right? As they step out on the acreage, so I am going to have to go for option three of your multiple choice there. I think it's too early to say both, while we can extrapolate the initial overall trend from North America or whether there is any significant impact or the recent trend that we see in the Bakken.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber - Bernstein: Paal, I found you comment about becoming more selective regarding when and where you chose you peers interesting. Is this a reflection of capacity constraints desires to avoid problematic contracts some of those? Why is the stance shifting?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think obviously if a customer calls upon us and wants us, generally, we will do utmost to serve them. At the same time, we also have to make sure that we prioritize putting our equipment into the customers that have initially selected us, and if we are going to go on replace the competitor on or their contracts, we obviously need a significant pricing increase from the initial rates that our competitors took the work on for, right? So, and there's also other strategic considerations as to where do we put our capacity while it's a priority in terms of the customer mix this well, so can't really going into the details of how we select, what to do. I would just say that we will always look to serve our customers as best as we can. But at the same time, we are continuing to look at how we optimize our business mix and how we maximize the return from the resources that we have up in operations.
Scott Gruber - Bernstein: Okay. Then an unrelated follow-up. Can you discuss the efforts internally to improve the working capital management? If you look over the last six months you guys have held the line here on receivables and other current assets but I assume that you are not completely satisfied in the working capital at this point. Then if you have year end targets that you could share with us, that would be greatly appreciated?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well maybe I will say a little bit about what I think the investment community call self help initiatives, right. So first of all, in Schlumberger we believe that in order to maintain and extend to our market leading position, we always need to do better tomorrow than what we did today. So, company wide programs addressing execution improvements they are not really sporadic or episodic with us. They are a way of life. So we have, in recent years or in the recent year, put more focus on working capital on cash generation. In the past before we had more focus on more cost and resource management to be trying to balance the focus on both cost and resource management with cash management. So we have specific programs running focused on capital efficiency, around receivables and also around inventory management and we build it into our business plans and we also build it into the incentives of the entire management team. So this is really how we try to put focus on it and what we put focus on in Schlumberger will generally do quite well.
Simon Ayat: I would like to add a bit to what Paal said. The last couple of years since the acquisition of Smith, you probably noticed that the working capital as percentage of our sales has gone up a bit. This was all planned. As a result of expanding certain segments or product lines of Smith internationally, which are more inventory intensive segments or products line, we had to increase inventory to meet the expansion that we have done internationally. One of the main reasons for acquiring Smith and integrating it with the rest of Schlumberger is also to use the footprint of Schlumberger, which meant that some of those segments that were mainly U.S. focused we took them overseas and therefore an increase in inventory. We have managed to do this now and going forward we will not have to increase it at the same pace that we have done before.
Scott Gruber - Bernstein: Great, I appreciate the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. First of all, congrats on your decision to return a greater part of cash flow to shareholders. I think there is a very clear difference at the moment in this evaluation of companies who do that and those who don't in this slower growth environment that they are in. First of all what were the biggest technologies that drove your share gains?
Paal Kibsgaard: In terms of specific technologies, let me elevate it and maybe focus in on the product lines. So I would still say we have gained more share in wireline and drilling and measurements. Those are the kind of spearheading segment for these efforts, right. So there is number of new technologies that we have introduced in both these product lines over the past year or two and the uptake of them is good. What we also find now, as you know, we have restructured our engineering manufacturing into same organization about five years ago and this is really starting to pay dividends now because the new technology that comes out, it's performing much better than the initial technologies that came out five or ten years ago. There were lot more teething problems, which we are basically now avoiding. So, the new technology, which is commercialized within its first year, is actually now growing significantly faster than what it did may be five or ten years ago. So, I would say, wireline and drilling and measurements are still the ones again that are gaining the most share.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So it is then fair to say that this is largely driven by offshore?
Paal Kibsgaard: No I think, it's both on land and offshore.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and a follow-up question would be, what market share changes are you seeing in the offshore market? One of your largest competitors continuously make claims that they are gaining share across all kind of (inaudible) technologies?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I don't know who they are gaining share from, because it isn’t us. So I think, we are in the offshore market we obviously already have a quite a high share, but we reference Gulf of Mexico in some of these discussions and we continue to gain share in the Gulf of Mexico and in several of our high end product lines.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Just finally, how far away do you think from being a new pricing cycle in North America pressure pumping?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say there is still significant overcapacity horsepower in the sitting on the sides today, so I don't see that happening in 2013, at least. I think, we are still going to have overcapacity as we exit this year.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Finally, what are some of technologies that are reducing the pressure pumping in tentatively of shale oil and gas in North America?
Paal Kibsgaard: What technologies do that?
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, HiWAY is obviously one of them. We use significantly [less] and also generally less water in the operations that we do with HiWAY. The other way of reducing or lowering the intensity of these operations is to use much more of the subsurface approach prior to actually designing the jobs, right? So, having a much better understanding of the subsurface will allow you to design the completion of the well and the amount of horsepower water and pump use by be more selective in which stages you frac and also using more sophisticated frac fluids like HiWAY.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Are you seeing a change in attitude there with the shale oil gain becoming more and more of a large company gain?
Paal Kibsgaard: Not a dramatic change, but I would say we have. We are starting to get several key customers that we are collaborating much closer with than what we've done in the past and where we engage all the way from characterization to drilling and production and taking a much more sophisticated approach to how we go about working with them on their developments, right? So, it's still relatively slow, but through some of the contracts we won over the past 12 months to 18 months, we have established as part of those contracts, a very strong technical collaboration agreements, which are also benefiting technology penetration.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So, on Forest Oil, the contract being in Eagle Ford, how would you characterize that in the context of just that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I can't really comment on that. Forest will release their results I think in a couple of weeks. We'd need to refer you to them.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim: Thanks and good afternoon, guys. I wanted to just follow up on the North American onshore market and a little bit on the Forest Oil as well as Spark. Let me ask the questions just from the context of shift in business model in North America. I think both with Forest as well as Spark, you've tried to introduce a new model to the U.S. land market and I was just wondering now as you've been out marketing concepts like that for a while what the perception has been and what you think the uptake and penetration rate might look like?
Paal Kibsgaard: On Spark, we are seeing a reasonable uptake on it. Nothing dramatic which we weren't expecting either. It's mainly focused on customers that are have vertically integrated. They have their own horsepower with very limited capabilities in terms of pumping more sophisticated fluid systems, so we continue to do Spark-related activity, but it isn't a significant part of our business which weren't really expecting either, but it's progressed reasonably well and we are happy with the performance from this. We are mainly doing Spark in North America, but we are also doing Spark in China for some of the frac operations there. The other part of your question in terms of the Forest Oil type of deal, initially as we said when we closed the Forest deal, our main motivation for doing that type of a deal was actually to get a display window for our shale technology capabilities, so we haven't really been actively out promoting SPM or production incentive type of contracts in North America, beyond trying to get that deal done, so we could demonstrate our capabilities for the technologies that we have developed. So, we know other progress or we haven't really even been pushing that model beyond that one deal we struck.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, two questions, one, I wanted to follow up on just how things are progressing on the SPM side. In the first quarter, you mentioned you had 10 projects. Goal was that two to three a year. I didn't see anything in the press release with regards to another announcement there. Perhaps if you could just update us on your thoughts? And maybe perhaps your size for us on a revenue basis annually? What SPM is going to contributing to the top-line for Schlumberger?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, you are correct. We didn't sign any SPM projects in the second quarter. Our goal of adding two to three projects a year basically stands firm. But again, as I mentioned on my comments on the Mexico bid round, we will only sign the project that we believe are right for us. This is all about portfolio management. It is about picking the right projects, the right fields with the right terms and we have very stringent return criterias in terms of what we will engage in. So, our goal is two to three deal. If we can get the right ones, we will do it and if we can't find the right ones we won't do it. In terms of the impact on the business, it's still relatively a small part of our overall revenue stream, but by picking the right project it is a highly accretive part of our revenue stream and we will continue to focus in on maintaining it as highly accretive.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: Right. Your view has been that these projects are accretive to margins and essentially every geo market in which you have rolled it out. Is that correct?
Paal Kibsgaard: That is correct.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: Okay, great. Well, my second question was just a follow up on North America margins, specifically as it relates to Geco which was called out in the press release but you didn't you specify, perhaps I missed it in earlier comments, whether or not Geco really was being driven in the Gulf, more by the Marine side of the business or whether we saw multiclient or maybe a combination of both? Then maybe just address Gulf of Mexico Geco as we think about the balance of '13?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, in the Gulf, in terms of ongoing operations, we have one Dual Coil fleet operating. It continues to operate in the Central Gulf. It has got a good backlog of things to do there on the multiclient site acquisition. We have an ongoing multiclient late sales business where we had some revenue progression which is seasonal basically from Q1 to Q2. We don't break up what that revenue progression was in a multiclient. You can see what the total is. The total for Q2 worldwide was $250 million, up from $175 million in Q1. So a part of that was North America, but I would say as the general comment on the multiclient performance in North America in Q2, it was below our expectations. We were expecting more sales to multiclient than what we actually realized. In addition to the multiclient business in terms of late sales and acquisition in the Gulf of Mexico we also started of the third-party survey offshore Eastern Canada and this is with isometrics. So those are basically the WesternGeco business in North America.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: All right. That sounds like that continues in second half of the year should be accretive to overall North America margins?
Paal Kibsgaard: They should.
Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil: Okay. Thanks, Paal, for the time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Good morning, guys or good afternoon and it hasn't been said. So I will say, congratulations on a great quarter. Very impressive of you and the team.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Simon Ayat: Thank you.
Angie Sedita - UBS: On Mexico, Paal, I appreciate the color on the production of incentive contracts and the bidding there, but your thoughts on, I believe the next round of awards will be IPM potentially as much I have heard as $8 billion to $10 billion in contracts. You view that as the better and more attractive opportunity in the region and then along with that, have you had conversations with Pemex on the potential timing and is it multi-year for Mexico to open up and the opportunities there?
Paal Kibsgaard: So what we know about the bids coming out is that there are a series of bids. So probably there would be a single service bids, there would be IPM well construction bids and there will probably be more production incentive type of bids coming out as well over the next couple of quarters. So, as I said earlier, we are very interested in the Mexican market. It is going to be very highly competitive. It has always been highly competitive but it's about, as I said before, being able to bid strategically, trying to pick up the right contracts and the right opportunities and having a plan for how you would create value for Pemex and at the same time create value for Schlumberger as we engage in these contracts, right. So I gave you a quick summary of our view on the third run of the FDM contracts and we will continue to evaluate every opportunity for gaining more work in Mexico and will engage in it with a view to make returns for the Schlumberger shareholders.
Angie Sedita - UBS: All right. Then on the U.S. market, thoughts on the pace of activities for Q3 and Q4, are you seeing based on your conversations with the customers still steadily higher in Q3 as far as activity and Q4, the seasonal decline or are we going to run into the spent budgets that we did last year?
Simon Ayat: Well, whether Q4 is going to see the same as last year, I think it's just too early to say. Obviously, as WTI ticking up a little bit over the past month or so could be a positive preventing that from happening, but I still think it's too early to say what will happen in Q4. Our overview on the second half of the year U.S. land is, I think rig count is going to remain relatively flattish, but drilling efficiency is going to be the main activity driver, again generating reasonable growth in stage count, sequentially. Looking at Canada, we expect the H2 rig count at this stage to come in or the recovery in the H2 rig count to come in lower than 2012. While the stage can be expect to be more or less flat with last year. Then, again, continued strong activity in terms of offshore Gulf of Mexico, both shales and deepwater.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Then finally you mentioned Russia being one of your strongest geo markets in 2013, is that in part driven by the Eurasia deal, or is it outside of that project?
Simon Ayat: Well, the Eurasia deal is part of our business and it's important part of our business in Russia, but it is only part of it. We have significant other activities both, on land and offshore both, in Sakhalin, in the Caspian, in the Barents, in the Arctic, so we are very well diversified in terms of both, customers and regions that we operate in Russia and that's why I think we manage to sustain very high growth rates.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Jim Crandell from Cohen. Please go ahead.
Jim Crandell - Cohen: Paal, one of your competitors was indicating in the marine seismic business relative softness in bidding activity for the fall winter season. What are you seeing in the fall winter season relative to the spring summer season and how does pricing look for that season right now?
Paal Kibsgaard: For the marine market, we maintain our positive outlook, which we have basically conveyed over the past couple of quarters, right? The way we see its supply and demand appears to be relatively well balanced. In terms of bookings for Q3, we are basically already fully booked, and also Q4 in terms of backlog is filling up quite well. So, activity wise, things are looking quite good for us. In terms of pricing, in the second quarter, we didn't see any significant further traction in terms of basic bid pricing, but we also track another pricing indicator, which is revenue per streamer and our revenue per streamer was up about 10%, sequentially, and that's mainly at the backend of new technology and the type of service we conduct and also some seasonality effect. That's basically where we stand.
Jim Crandell - Cohen: Good. That's helpful. And, one follow-up question about WesternGeco, when you used to break it out, this would of course be obvious, but could you give some indication where margins are relative to let's say the oil service average at WesternGeco, and I am just trying to handle on how much margin leverage there was there going forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: We are not breaking out about any individual product line is doing in terms of margins. I can't really comment on that, but given where pricing stands and given the very significant new technology portfolio, we have and just putting into operation both, on land in terms of processing as well as marine, we obviously see margin upside potential for WesternGeco.
Operator: And, we have time for one further question today. That question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering: One of my questions I have is around the U.S. land business. You mentioned improved well service and pressure pumping utilization several times in the release. What are your thoughts around bringing some of the never deployed equipment in to the market given where your margins are? How do you see that as an opportunity in the second half of the year?
Paal Kibsgaard: So we will look at bringing equipment in from what we have apart when we can get the utilization that we require for the overall group and at this stage we are not looking to bring anything back in that we have parked and I don't expect that to happen in 2013.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering: Great, thank you. Then my last question is just around the reservoir characterization business. With the significant margins increase there, I mean obviously multiclient helps, but if I look back historically there doesn't really tends to be a follow-up in multiclient sales in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter. So any reason we should think about margins perhaps stepping backwards in the Reservoir Characterization business in the second half of the year?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, nothing fundamental. This is a huge business and there are mixed effects depending on what region grows and there is exploration and development type of mixes even in characterization, but overall I expect the Characterization Group to continue to post very strong margins.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering: All right, thank you guys very much.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Julie. Good evening and good morning from China, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2013 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Shanghai, where a Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.01. This is $0.07 lower sequentially and $0.05 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded $0.07 of charges relating to the currency devaluations in Venezuela. Oilfield services first quarter revenue of $10.7 billion decreased 4.5% sequentially while the pretax operating margins declined 37 basis points. More than half of the $506 million sequential revenue decrease is the result of the absence of the year-end surge in the product, software and WesternGeco multiclient sales that we experienced in Q4. The remainder of the decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal weather-related slowdowns we typically experience in Q1. Given the significant impact that these seasonal factors had on our sequential performance, our comments will focus on year-on-year changes unless otherwise noted. Oilfield services revenue increased 7.6% year-on-year, while pretax operating margins declined by 59 basis points. Highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir characterization, revenue of $2.8 billion increased 8.5% while margins grew by 94 basis points to 27%. These increases are primarily attributable to a very strong performance in testing services on improved offshore exploration activity Drilling Group revenue of $4.1 billion increased 9.2%, and margins improved by 57 basis points to 17.9%. These improvements were led by drilling and measurements on strong offshore drilling activity across all international areas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Production Group revenue of $3.8 billion, increased 6.9%, while margins fell by 237 basis points to 15.1%. The effects of ongoing pricing pressure for well services technologies in U.S. land, more than offset by double-digit revenue growth across all other segments. This performance was led by the strong Schlumberger Production Management and subsea product lines. The margin declined for the group was entirely attributable to the impact of the continued excess hydraulic horsepower capacity in U.S. land. Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 23.3% in the first quarter, compared to 23.8% in the previous quarter and 23.6% in the first quarter of 2012. Net debt increased $162 million during the quarter to $5.3 billion, reflecting the seasonal deterioration in working capital that we typically see during the first quarter. During the quarter, we spent $894 million on CapEx and we repurchased 2.5 million shares at an average price of $77.63. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.9 billion in 2013, as compared to $4.7 billion, we spent in 2012. Now, I turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Our first quarter results were solid, driven primarily by the overall strength and progress of our international business, but also by continued margin resilience in North America, in spite of both activity and pricing challenges. All together, earnings per share were up 5%, compared to the same quarter of last year. Looking at the international markets in more detail, our revenue grew 30% year-over-year, while operating income was up 21% and margin expanded 135 basis points, demonstrating the strength of both, the international market potential as well as our execution capabilities. Sequentially, revenue was down 5%, due to the normal seasonal slowdown in the Northern hemisphere and the Far East, while operating margin was up three basis points driven in part by strong performance from our IPM and SPM product lines. In terms of Q1 activity, the international rig count was up 7% versus the same quarter last year. Pricing trends remained stable with revenue per rig continuing to slow but steady progress now observed over the past six quarters. In this environment, we continue to drive high-end technology sales throughout our international operations and we are also actively adding our latest new technology introductions to our existing contract base. New technology sales together with strong execution and operational performance, helps drive both, effective pricing and margin levels. In Latin America, revenue was up 8% year-over-year, while operating margin was up 123 basis points, driven by strong execution, cost control and new technology sales. As previously communicated, during the quarter, we have had a series of very constructive meeting in Venezuela with PDVSA, and we expect to finalize a new payment agreement in the near-future and we anticipate ramping up activity to meet the current and future needs of PDVSA's development and production plans. Elsewhere in Latin America, Ecuador posted the highest growth rates in the first quarter, driven by excellent performance in our Shushufindi SPM project. The de-risking of our development plan is now largely complete and we are operating four drilling and two workover rigs. With production levels progressing in line with our plans, the project is set to generate significant value to both, Ecuador and Schlumberger in the coming years. In Argentina, activity was also strong in the first quarter, again driven by drilling and stimulation activity in the Neuquen basin and from our IPM project in the Vaca Muerta shale. In Brazil, overall rig count remained flat in Q1. However, we did see activity starting to shift back from work over to drilling for several deepwater rigs. Our main focus in Q1 was on the startup of new contracts. As previously stated, the Brazil contracts were generally bid at very competitive prices for basic technology. However, given the complex and challenging operating environment, the use of high-end technologies can create significant value for both our customer and for Schlumberger. We are therefore already in discussions to add our latest technologies to the contracts and we will continue to actively introduce new and value adding products and services over the span of these long-term contracts. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 21% year-over-year while the operating margin was 125 basis points, driven by strong performance throughout the region. In the Middle East, we again saw the strongest growth in Saudi Arabia, where activity is progressing as planned and in Iraq where operational performance on our IPM rigs was strong. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait also posted solid growth in Q1, driven by higher customer activity and further supported by market share gains from recent contract wins. In Asia, the normal seasonal slowdown led to lower sequential activity in both China and Australia but this did not prevent both tier markets from posting very strong year-over-year growth numbers. In China, growth continues to come from both complex conventional land developments as well as from offshore. While in Australia, Queensland unconventionals gas activity together with deepwater drilling activity in the Northwest will lead the growth in the coming year. As stated in the January call, we expect strong growth from the Middle East and Asia in 2013 and our Q1 results are so far validating this trend. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was up 11% year-over-year and the operating margin was up 120 basis points. Growth in the first quarter was driven by Sub-Sahara Africa, where activity was robust throughout the region. Angola was particularly strong for us in Q1 driven by development and exploration drilling as well as Marine seismic operations. In North Africa growth was limited during the first quarter. While the pending contract issues were generally result security has again emerged as the primary challenge and had a significant impact on activity levels during the quarter. Our customers on now in the process of evaluating future activity plans and the need for additional security measures and we expect activity to remain subdued as long as this process is ongoing. In the North Sea, we saw the normal seasonal slowdown due to winter weather, but activity still showed solid year-over-year growth as the transition from exploration to development and production related work continued. In Russia and Central Asia, we also experienced the normal seasonal slowdown in activity. Still the region posted one of the highest year-over-year growth rate in the first quarter driven by offshore activity in Sakhalin and by land activity in Kazakhstan. Russia and Central Asia remains on track to be one of our main growth drivers in 2013. In North America, revenue was down 4% while the operating margin was down 356 basis points compared the same quarter last year. Still at 19.1%, our margin remained significantly higher than in previous cycles, and is a very clear testament to our newly built strength in the North American market. Looking at the North America land market in detail, U.S. land rig activity in the first quarter came in below expectations, although the data showed some increase in total rig count towards the end of the quarter. At the same time, drilling efficiency remained strong, asset utilization improved from the low level seen over the holiday season and lower guar cost provided some relief to pressure pumping margins. Still the main concern in North America land remains the pricing, where the downwards trend in drilling, wireline and coiled tubing seen in the fourth quarter continued in Q1. In addition, we also saw further downward pricing pressure on a number of hydraulic fracturing bids during the quarter adding further uncertainty to the North America land market outlook. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the overall rig count remained strong, but operational delays relating to the change out of subsea connectables on the deepwater rigs had a negative impact on our results for parts of the quarter. However at this stage, we expect these issues to generally be behind us and that the U.S. Gulf of Mexico contributions to our business will be in line with expectations for the year. In WesternGeco, we continue to operate one deal closely in the Central Gulf, while multi-client sales relating to the Central Gulf, lease sales in March came in well below expectations in the first quarter. Let me now turn to technology, where I would like to highlight our integration capabilities and the growing value it brings to our business. As our customers continue to look for ways to reduce finding, development and lifting costs, a number of them are now seeking much closer and broader partnerships with us to add up more value from the E&P value chain. This includes more collaborative problem solving for utilizing our complementary expertise and by further leveraging our wide technology offering and broad integration capabilities. We have carefully built up our integration capabilities over the past 15 years by developing the required distance processes and people competencies and by filling unmatched spirit of teamwork through our metrics organization. In terms of our integration offering, we had a range of business models and profit area with varying levels of integration and contract rigs. Through our IPM product line, we offer project coordination for contracts offshore exploration and development project, long-term currency contract for land well construction, intervention and production enhancement campaigns for mature fields both, offshore and onshore as well as P&A activity for aging offshore installations. Today, we operate these types of contracts throughout our global operations, covering all parts of our customer base. In addition to our IPM product line, we also offer a complete field management capabilities to our SPM product line, where we reach the value of our products and services and sometimes cash in return for fee per barrel of incremental production. Today, our overall integration capabilities represent a key strength and competitive advantage for us in the marketplace, and going forward we will continue to develop these capabilities in order to help our customers extract more value from their oil and gas assets. Let's then turn to the macro environment, where we so far this year have seen mixed data from the main economies, including China, the U.S. and euro zone, still the overall outlook for 2013 remains largely unchanged from the update we gave in January, both in terms of GDP growth as well as the fundamentals for the global oil and gas markets. Looking at our industry, the major trends from 2012, are as expected continuing this year. In the international market, we see strong and consistent growth in key regions such as Sub-Sahara Africa, Russia, Middle East, China and Australia, and the customer activity in general progressing in line with our stated expectations. In North America land, the outlook remains uncertain driven by lower than expected rig activity and by further pricing weakness. Cold weather and flattening natural gas production has led to longer than expected storage withdrawals in the U.S. in the past couple of months, however this is yet to result in an increase in dry gas drilling activity. In this environment, our entire organization remains focused on growth, margin and earnings out performance throughout our global operations. This commitment and drive is starting to have a direct impact on our results as seen by the following three facts. First, our international leadership position in terms of operating margins and shareholder income is as strong as ever, and our international leverage in terms of operating income is approximately 70% of the total. Second, following the restructuring of our land business, we have recently taken the lead in terms of operating margins also in North America. Third, we have, on average, delivered double digit growth in earnings per share over the past few years and we are, as previously stated, looking to extend this trend in 2013. These results, combined with the collective motivation of the 1,200 Schlumberger employees to do even better going forward, gives me a lot of confidence in our future ability to outperform and to provide superior returns to our investors. Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Paal. Julie, we will open the call for questions now.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) With that, we will go to the line of David Anderson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: The oil price weakness has really been weighing on these energy stocks clearly. I know you touched on it in your remarks there, but when you look at the fundamentals of the oil market right now, has anything changed really, as you have been looking at the fundamentals? Is anything getting you concerned regarding outlook? Or is it really basically the same as you saw it 90 days ago?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, at this stage we haven’t really changed our outlook. We have obviously seen the recent drop in brent prices which is mainly driven by the recent macro numbers and also seasonally lower demands but we still expect very strong support around the $100 per barrel. As the amount picks up from the seasonal low in Q2. So as overall, we have not really changed our view (inaudible)?
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Are any markets out there particularly vulnerable to a slowdown or is there still more than enough cushion here that you don’t really get too concerned here?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I am not overly concerned. I think with (inaudible) both on WTI and brent. At this stage, I think both, at current levels, both the international activity as well as North American liquids activity is pretty solid at these levels.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Okay, and could you just touch a little bit more on the Middle East, just to expand to some of your comments there. Last quarter, I believe you said you were expecting the rig count to get to about 170 rigs. Do you still think that? Is it higher? Is it lower than that? Also if could touch on how much of the incremental demand is coming from unconventional gas?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay, well if you look at the Q1 performance in Saudi, that was, as I mentioned, quite strong for us. The total rigs at the end of the quarter was now up to 140. We are still maintaining the number of 170 rigs by year-end. So really no change to the Saudi outlook. It is progressing pretty much in line with what we were expecting. What was the second part of your question?
David Anderson - JPMorgan: I was just curious as to how much of that incremental demand that you are seeing is going to go towards unconventional gas or the tight gas that they are going for these days?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay, so I would think 2013, that is still going to be quite limited. There are pilots ongoing which we are involved with but in terms of overall rig count and activity levels, these are still quite small in the overall picture in Saudi. So not a significant part in 2013.
Operator: We will go to line of James West with Barclays. Please go ahead.
James West - Barclays Capital: Paal, one quick question and a follow-up which maybe a little bit longer but do you still expect 10%-age type international activity growth this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. That is roughly where we see. There is no real change to what we said in January. About 10% increase in international E&P spend.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay, perfect. As a follow-up, so if we think about international pricing, you obviously cited six quarters of increased revenue per rig. One of your competitors this morning cited Saudi and the ramp up there as a potential catalyst to create an inflection point. I know one of your other competitors has talked recently about, this is the time now to raise pricing. Are you seeing evidence from competition in the market? I know you guys have been trying to push pricing for a while here, have you guys seen evidence that your competitors are now on board with this and starting to push price internationally?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if anything, I haven’t seen any significant change in behavior. I think we have moved on from the nonsense pricing that we saw a few years back. But apart from that, no dramatic change in behavior from the main players as far as we have see. We have continued to be able to drive revenue per rig which is kind of the overall pricing indicator. That has to do with new technology sales, it has to do with efficiency and it has to do with the overall quality of our operations. But in terms of this pricing, other than testing pricing on small and medium sized rigs, but a reasonable success, there hasn't been any dramatic change and we still don't foresee any major inflection in 2013 based on where we stand today.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, Paal.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: So, just to follow-up on that question, you know, there are obviously indications that with the tone on the international market as at least from what I can pick up drastically improved over the course of the past couple of quarters as it relates to the outlook. Schlumberger has been in a strong international position for quite some time, and I think your margin this quarter kind of demonstrate that progress. As you go forward, are you picking up though that there is any increase and sense of urgency at the customer base and have you envisioned Schlumberger continuing to maintain the wide margin differentials that you have enjoyed over the last 10, 15 years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, first of all, I mean, we are maintaining our positive view on the international market, which stems all the way back from last year, right? For reference, last year, we grew revenue by 16% and operating income 31% on the back of an 8% growth in recon and this is really the kind of numbers we are aiming for again this year. So, overall, we haven't really changed our view on the international market, we're just consistently focusing on it and we consistently delivering in that marketplace. And, in terms of protecting our market differentiation, our market lead, I mean that's what we have been doing over the past 5, or 10, or 15 years, but there is nothing really new there. We view that through the leverage of our size, our infrastructure, our local knowledge and the fact that we've in these markets for 50, 60, 70 years, and also the fact that we have a strong focus on execution both, from an efficiency and a quality standpoint. So, there's really nothing new in terms of how they are going about it. It is just progressing quite fine in our view.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Then just as a follow-up. I know, investors were trying to get their arms around the joint venture that you did with Forest, last week. Just wondering if you might be able to take this opportunity to give the perspective on that and with my understanding being the key element here you are trying to increase or accelerate the uptake in technology in the U.S. market relative to where you've already seen internationally, so I wonder if you provide additional color on that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. That's fair. So, if you look at our SPM, we have been pursuing production for a number of years and today we are earning about 10 of these SPM projects worldwide and these are generally fee per barrel contracts with no working interest. Now, in recent years, we have invested significantly in the shale workflows and shale technologies, and it is all about taking a much more scientific approach to drive production and recovery. Now, our approach is used extensively in the pilot projects in the international market, however as we talked about before the offtake is quite slow in the U.S. with the exception of some key customers, so we wanted to do was to create an SPM project in the U.S. to really have a showcase and be able to demonstrate our capabilities. The Forest deal became an opportunity, and initially we aim for the traditional SPM contract model here that wasn't workable for a variety of reasons, so the working interest was really only solution to get the deal done, but it was much more of a consequence rather than the objective, so this is a one-off deal in terms of taking working interest and we have no plans or pursuing this type of contract model further and it's really key for us to demonstrate our capabilities within the shale technologies and shale workflow and get a higher return on the significant R&D investments we made in to this area, so that is the whole rationale for the deal.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I'd like to follow-up on the SPM model, in particular what differentiates it from IPM and integrated or bundled services that your competitors might provide? You mentioned fee per barrel, but what are the true characteristics in addition to the revenue model with respect to the breadth of services and the ability to leverage the technology?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at the SPM model, we will then take full control in terms of operation and decision making when it comes to the field development, or rather it's a some set of a field or a complete field. In the IPM modules, the overall decision making is still generally governed by the E&P Company. So in the SPM module, we get to decide where to drill, how to drill, how to work over, and how to further invest in to the field. In the SPM module, we will risk the value of our products and services in general and in some cases, also risk cash in to the deal. But predominantly it’s the value of the our products and services. So that means if we create incremental production, we will get paid and we will get paid also an upside view on what we have invested but if we don’t deliver incremental production then, obviously, that is our problem. So its mainly the overall risk profile of the deal combined with the fact that we have complete management control of the operations within the SPM deal structure.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities: You mentioned terms of another 10 projects globally right now which suggests to me that we are still pretty early in the evolution of this concept. Do you have an idea as to how big this market could be or just from a resource limitation within Schlumberger, how big it could get over the next two or three years?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, it is a part of our business which we are looking to grow because it is highly accretive to our margins, if you look at the portfolio we have. At the same time, it is resource intensive. The whole sales cycle is quite long. Also we are very careful in terms of evaluating the project that we get ourselves into. So we are interested in growing it in our traditional SPM module. But it is an area where we can afford to hurry slowly. So there is nothing that we are looking to ramp dramatically.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities: Okay, but is it fair to say that 10 projects could 20 in the next two to three years? Is that the trajectory that we seem to be on?
Paal Kibsgaard: Probably not 20. If you look at reasonable size project, we might look to add two, maybe three, a year. I would say that’s probably the maximum at this stage.
Operator: Thank you. We will go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: Quick question on North American margins. Given the magnitude of the drop in multiclient sales expected seasonally, coupled with the Gulf of Mexico issues in Q1, I would have expected margins to be a little bit more poorly behaved and yet, they were only flat to down. Wanted comments for that Brazilian, just quarter-on-quarter.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think its still three things. Canada had a reasonable quarter. Decent activity there and the breakup happened towards the end of the quarter as we were planning. Gulf of Mexico, although there were delays in the deepwater operations, also posted quite a strong quarter overall, although it could have been better. Then its all about the approach we take to U.S. land. Particularly in pressure pumping, we are not receiving share. We are looking to protect margins and we are focusing very much on utilization and only taking on contracts that meet a certain return for us. So its how we manage U.S. land and then we have decent performances in both Canada and the Gulf of Mexico although multiclient sales were down quite significantly, sequentially.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: With the reversal of the operational delays in Q1 in the Gulf of Mexico, also taking into account breakup in Canada for the second quarter, what should we expect for North American margins in Q2? Still flat to down or could it be better than that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would lover for them to go up, just to say that. But you point at the main items here, right. So we would have continued pricing challenges on U.S. land. At the same time, as we will have the Canada breakup, those are the negative and then its just a matter of how well we can manage within the overall U.S. land operations as well as the progress we will make further in the Gulf of Mexico. I don’t expect a significant improvement in margins in Q2. If we can hold them around where we are I would be quite content.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: Okay, and then a point of clarification. With regard to your narrative on your SPM business model, if I understood you correctly, you basically take full operational control and that’s the distinction between that and IPM basically. On the Forest arrangement, if I read the press release correctly, Forest will continue to be the operator, is that correct?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. Forest will continue to be the operator. When I say operational control, we don't take on operating ship in any of these deals, but we have a much more of a say how we go about developing these fields, so there's always some dialogue with the E&P company who maintains operator ship, but if you look at it from a well construction type of contraction in IPM, where we are told where to drill and we just go by drilling the well, there's much more of a dialogue around the entire development plan within an SPM project and we have a lot more of it say in how they go about development.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Paal, so you noted, and one of your peers mentioned earlier today and then you noted that you don't believe that the Saudi activity will lead to a pricing inflection in 2013. It was also mentioned that Saudi activity could lead to higher activity by neighboring countries later this year and going into 2014, higher activity than already today. Any thoughts there?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, like I said before, the overall Middle East area is looking quite strong, so you have Saudi Arabia, you have Iraq and also you have Kuwait and then the UAE, which are also quite strong in terms of year-over-year activity and how that business is progressing, so don't get me wrong. I would love to see an inflection in pricing in 2013. It's just that I am not at the stage where I can promise it at this stage. We will continue to cut pricing and to try to move things along, because in our view there isn't a lot of spare capacity out in the international market at this stage. It's just that to predict that inflection, which we all have been waiting for quite a few years. I am not ready to do that yet.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Fair enough. And given that this work is gas work is oil as it was in last cycle, how do you see the service intensity even though there is tight gas and unconventional, so how do you see the service intensity of this growth in rig count versus what we saw in the prior cycle?
Paal Kibsgaard: Are you talking about Middle East?
Angie Sedita - UBS: Yes, and Saudi specifically.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. Well, I think the service intensity in Saudi and also the neighboring countries there is quite strong both, in gas as well as in liquids. There's a lot more deviated, again, extended reach in horizontal wells both for gas and liquids, so I think overall service intensity is strong and it requires high end technology and very solid operational performance, which again thanks to our strength.
Angie Sedita - UBS: All right. Then there is unrelated follow-up on the one Forest JV with Cameron. Any further insights on when we'll have details on the structure? When the deal will close? And then has the team determined how long do you think it will take to develop your own subsea separation unit?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, in terms of when we are looking to close the deal, we were hoping to do in Q1, but it's going to now slide into Q2 as you see. Our goal will be try to close in June. We're just getting the final regulatory approvals from various countries. We have most of it sorted out by now, but we are relatively confident, we will get it closed in Q2. At that stage, we will then put the organization in place. There has been some limited discussions with Cameron on how that is going to be, so I think we should be ready to hit the floor running s soon as we get the deal closed during the quarter. And as to when we will get a new technology to introduce and so forth, I think it's a bit premature for me to comment on that at this stage. Other than that, we will have quite aggressive R&D plans for the JV. We have some significant objectives that we want to achieve, but I think I'll hold on from commenting on that at this stage.
Angie Sedita - UBS: All right. Fair enough. I'll turn it over. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Just certainly a higher level question, on your press release, there you've mentioned that growth in North America oil production has been offset by other non-OPEC producers seeing declining production limits expect spare capacity to remain around current levels. Could you elaborate a little bit on this statement, try to put some numbers around it if you feel confident about that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at spare capacity now, I believe it's ticking around 4 million barrels, right? So, we expect it to be around this level in the near-term barring any major macro events. If you look at the balance of supply and demand, the overall demand growth projected for this year is about just short of 1% or 800,000 to 900,000 barrels a day. Offsetting that demand growth is mainly the continued growth in North American production, and we don’t expect any significant growth in the non-OPEC production outside of North America. That leads to core in OPEC and more or less unchanged. That is the main balancing that we are looking at this is stage which is similar to what we talked about in January.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: In a historic context, so would you say that this is a constructive backdrop or is this a backdrop which could lead to some other business?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at 4 million barrel of spare capacity on about 90 million barrels of production, it is around 4% and it is still about 1 million barrels below where we stood prior to the Libya conflict, right. So I don’t think this is an excessive spare capacity. I think its, if anything, probably relatively tight.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Very good. Secondly, you mentioned the ability to upsell technology. We have all seen the headline numbers. Let's use Brazil, as an example. So do you expect this fully to offset some of the pricing pressures on recent contract signings? So let's say Latin American margins, do you expect to be able to hold those margins at this level?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I cant guarantee it quarter to quarter, but I would say that for all these large contracts that we have been talking about for the past year and not just in Latin America but globally, we have overall plan in terms of how we bid for the basic technologies which are generally comparable to our competitors. Then beyond that, for these medium to long-term contracts, we have a plan on what new technologies will be introduced and added to the contract base. Based on these technologies which will bring significant value to our customers but also to us, we are quite confident that we can make these contracts that were really quite competitively bid in to quite viable contracts for us over this time of the contract term.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So when we think about margins, if you look at your North American margin, very impressive level at the moment, more or less in line with your international margins, when do you think you will exit the year? With higher North American margins or a bit higher international margins, relative to one another?
Paal Kibsgaard: It’s a good question. If I was going to make a bet, without really committing to it, I would say I still expect our international margins will be higher than North America, in terms of the exit of this year.
Operator: We will go to line of Scott Gruber with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein: Coming back to the motivation for the Forest deal. You have the appetite for technology in the US onshore is always been low but has there been any degradation to that demand? Have the E&P's, as they move in to the harvest mode to the shales and now that conventional service pricing is lower, has that actually diminished the need for technology in the U.S.? Is this the response to that?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I don’t think its going in that direction. I think what you will find is that in the past, we haven’t really had a significant focus on developing new and high-end technologies that had, I would say, a significant application in North America. Now, over the five years, with the renewed focus we have on North America, we have a little more in to these type of technologies and what you are looking for now is just to try to accelerate the penetration to get return on these investments. So, there is no, I would say, reversal of the technology uptake. It is just that we have a much broader, and I would say, much more interesting technology portfolio with applications in North America and we are quite eager to get these technologies further into the marketplace.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein: Great, and then turning back to the macro picture. Paal, you mentioned that the backdrop today remains constructive even with the a bit of declining crude price. One of the top concerns we hear is how long can Schlumberger can tend to grow at something close to 10% in a world of flat crude prices? How do you think about the medium-term outlook for growth over the next the, call it, three years? If crude prices are flat, can you still pose topline international growth that comes close to 10%?
Paal Kibsgaard: We are still confident that we can do that. I think that there is obviously several ways that we are pursuing this. We, obviously, are present in every market around the world, so we have a kind of a very broad, broad opportunity. But one thing I think will be quite interesting from our side is that if you assume that crude prices are going to stay flat as you indicate, then I think it's going to be a need for our customers to look at driving more costs out of the E&P value chain, and I will say integration, which I talked about today has the potential to do that. Also overall quality and efficiency of operations, which and in many cases comes down to the size of the operation is also going to be key. So I think we have hit on several, I think, unique enablers that will allow us to be a very interesting partner for the E&P companies in terms of helping them drive overall costs out of their system and then basically and lot more activity for us and more hope for us.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to line of Jim Crandell with Cowen Securities. Please go ahead.
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities: Okay. Good morning. Paal, I know that Schlumberger is a company that of course pays a lot of attention to its market shares around the world, in formation the valuation. I was a little bit surprised to hear one of your two major competitors on their call this morning say that in LWD, MWD, they are the market leader now in revenues in both, the Gulf of Mexico and Norway, A, would you agree with this? And, B, is this something that you have a plan to reverse?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, Jim, there's nothing to reverse. If there's anyone who is the leader in LWD, in any place around the world, that's Schlumberger. I don't think I am really going to engage further into that question.
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities: Okay. I was surprised when I heard their response, but anyway. Secondly, could you specifically talk about the Petrofac joint venture? And, where you are in that and additional work that could be forthcoming there?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So, we are still engaged with Petrofac in evaluating in SPM type opportunities around the world. We are still actively in dialogue with them. There's a number of prospects that we are pursuing. The overall sales cycle for these projects is quite long and the project we are looking at with Petrofac is also whether it's a balance between what is required from the subservice, which is our strength as well as what is required from the services, which is obviously their strength, right? But, that whole corporation agreement is still very much intact and we are still engaged with them in pursuing global opportunities.
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities: Okay. Good. Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Good morning. Could you please speak to, well, I guess the following issues that relates to the second quarter? So, in the non-North American markets there's this traditional seasonal recovery. And if I look at the last second quarter, you had 9% sort of sequential revenue growth and 40% type of sequential incremental margins. And I guess, I am just curious whether or not there are some dynamics that happened in the first quarter in this year that might make a progression look different in the second quarter of this year. For example, the progress in SPM, which might make the seasonal pickup a little less dramatic or Latin America that might be the case, but if you could speak to something in that dynamic and give us some perspective on the second quarter non-Am, that would be helpful.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, in terms of Q2 consensus, you know that we don't give guidance, and looking at this chart, we are doing that, right? But I would just say that, generally, there's nothing dramatically different in our business today than what you saw a year ago. We expect good seasonal improvement in our earnings per share in Q2. As I mentioned several times during the quarter, international looks solid and I think the main uncertainty continues to be the market evolution in the North America land and the main headwinds there are going to be continued pressure on U.S. land in terms of pricing and the calendar breakup, but overall we expect to see kind of a good seasonal improvement in earnings per share in Q2.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Fair enough. Okay. Thanks. An unrelated follow-up please, just happen to notice significant pickup in working capital in Q1, which looks like it is stem from a sizable reduction in payables. Could you speak to that a little bit? What was driving that and perhaps give us some visibility on how cash might flow from working capital for the balance of the year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I will hand that to Simon.
Simon Ayat: So, as you mentioned, Q1 normally is a bit of a pressure on our working capital. One of the reason is actually the year-end compensation for our employees that is related to incentives and bonuses that takes place in Q1 funding of pensions and others. So this is a major deterioration that took place on the working capital. As far as the rest of the year, we expect to have a pretty good performance on collections as we call this during the year. CapEx, as I said, is $3.9 billion. We will continue to buy back to compensate for the increase or the stock reissue in relation to the stock-based compensation. So now we think that going forward into the year, the cash situation will improve.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Okay, and then just to clarify, I think I just heard you say, your starting point philosophy on share repurchases to cover what will be issued in shares as comp?
Simon Ayat: Correct and, as we always said, any excess cash over a period of time, we will return it to our shareholders. But the bottom level will be to compensate for creep in the number of shares., yes.
Operator: Thank you. next question is from Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: I guess, you are in China. You highlight China in one of your recent investor presentations. Could you help us think about, for one, size in the market for you guys today, the growth rate you guys are achieving. You have given us a little snapshot on Iraq recently as well. Any color you could provide on China would be very helpful.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, China, for us is one of our fastest growing gear markets. We are seeing a lot more opportunity emerging here over the past one or two years. The offshore business, we have always been strong in and that continues to grow but we see a lot more opening up of the land business, partly in terms of complex conventional land developments where we are working with our traditional Chinese customers but also as the shale is opening up to a lot of nontraditional customers. There is significantly higher market potential for us even in that market. So are we are quite, I would say, bullish in terms of the overall growth potential and the growth rate that we expect coming out of China. That’s why we, over the past 12 to 18 months have been trying to, I would say, improve or extend our position in the country and we continue to invest into the business here, both in terms of capacity but also how we JV and partner with local players. So overall China is way up there with the highest growth regions that we expect in the next couple of years.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: The other one, Paal, if I had was just around Venezuela. The release, and then you reiterate today, discussed ramping up of activity, could you just give us some color on this, anything on order of magnitude or timing? Is that a late this year event? Then will there be any incremental disclosure around receivables here in the Q1 10-Q?
Paal Kibsgaard: We are not going to disclose anything further on receivables beyond what we did in January. Our collections have improved in Venezuela during the quarter. As I mentioned, we have had a very good dialogue with Petrofac. They are keeping it here as we are expecting to finalize this payment agreement in the near future. We are basically ready to ramp up activity to meet the needs of Petrofac. The magnitude of that, we are still discussing. They have a significant resource base in Venezuela. They have the need for our products and services and when we get this payment agreement in place, we are very much ready to support with that they need.
Operator: Next question is from Waqar Syed with Goldman, Sachs & Co. Please go ahead.
Waqar Syed - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Paal, could you describe for us your current outlook for WesternGeco in terms of activity and also in terms of pricing? If you are seeing any change there?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, if I first look at the Q1, in marine, the Q1 most of the utilization improved sequentially. So that was good news. Going forward, we are still quite, I would say, optimistic in terms of how the year is evolving. In marine seismic, we have now the majority of our capacity booked for Q2 and Q3. In terms of pricing, we are still operating at more or less the same pricing levels that we saw in 2012, which is about 10% to 15% higher than what we saw in 2011. Right? So, for the small remaining part of the capacity that to be filled up for Q2 and Q3, we will obviously continue to test pricing further, but overall, we are looking at strong utilization for the next couple of quarters. Pricing hasn't moved significantly from where we were at last year, but it's still looking quite good.
Waqar Syed - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: In terms of new supply coming in over the next two to three years, are you seeing any red flags, any other signs of stability, or you feel confident about the longer term or intermediate-term outlook given some of the capacity adds?
Paal Kibsgaard: Are you talking about marine seismic?
Waqar Syed - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: That's right. Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I am not being overly concerned about [annual] capacity at this stage. There are new builds being planned that will enter into the market. We have two new vessels under construction, but these are generally high capacity vessels I think for the industry, meaning, 12 more streamers and generally these will likely replace vessels, or six streamer vessels, right? So I am not really overly concerned about overcapacity at this stage. Our new build vessels remain schedule will get delivery of the two of them in 2014.
Waqar Syed - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Okay. Then just one finally on your deal with Forest, what is your capital commitment in the coming years for development program there?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don't have the details about the capital commitments over the coming year. I think we are going to have to get back to you with that, but the overall deal is not very significant in terms of size, right? I think, like I said, the main motivation behind the deal is to create a showroom of what we can do in terms of shale technology and shale workflows in the U.S. So, I think, the overall headline, the deal is getting versus the size of it and the impact in Schlumberger, I think is sort of a little bit over dimension at this stage. Yes. And what we will contribute is generally going to be inclined in terms of the value of our products and services.
Waqar Syed - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to line of Robin Shoemaker with Citi. Please go ahead.
Robin Shoemaker - Citi: Thank you. Paal, I want to ask you about the number of deepwater rigs being delivered in the balance of this year in 2014 is sizable, something like 64 rigs if you exclude the rigs to be built in Brazil ultimately, but in terms of bidding for work on those rigs in the pre-delivery stage, how are you preserving your market share gaining. How competitive is that bidding in your view?
Paal Kibsgaard: You are talking about the global deepwater rig market now?
Robin Shoemaker - Citi: Yes, the global deepwater rig market, the rigs coming out of shipyards later this year and in '14?
Paal Kibsgaard: So, on how we are maintaining share in that, we have separate teams that are aiming at securing I would say contract than capacity on these rigs for the services that this is kind of relevant, so a lot of it has to do with cementing obviously. So, we have teams dedicated that basically pursues the new build owners to make sure that we get our share of the market for whatever we can capture prior to these rigs are coming out in the market and where we enter into the traditional biding sequence.
Robin Shoemaker - Citi: Okay. And I was also curious about the pricing dynamic here. Is this super competitive? Are you pleased with the pricing levels you are achieving on all of these deepwater related contracts?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I think, if you look at the overall performance of our deepwater operations both, in terms of growth and in terms of market share, in terms of margin, it's all highly accretive to the overall business that we have, so it really comes down to the kind of broad technology offering we have and the highly differentiated execution capabilities we have for this type of environment, which is really what Schlumberger is all about. So, no, I am quite pleased with how we are progressing in deepwater and it's a highly accretive part of our business.
Robin Shoemaker - Citi: Right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, and our last question comes from Turner Holm with Rs Platou Markets. Please go ahead.
Turner Holm - Rs Platou Markets: Actually my question is partially answered but I just wanted to question on the seismic utilization. You guys have been running at about 70% in Q4 and that lead to about 75% in Q1 from the data that we have. First of all, those numbers about ballpark correct. So is that low utilization relative to your peer function of switching over tied to metrics? to tighter utilization. I guess what I am getting at is, would you expect utilization to improve in these low levels here as you move throughout the year? When combined that with price increases and isometrics (inaudible), could see seismic have a new (inaudible) impact from here?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, firstly, I don’t think I would validate all your utilization numbers. Our Q1 utilization is higher than what you have indicated. Although in Q1 we did have a fair bit of transporting. We had a few docking and also some permitting delays. But overall, the utilization in Q1 was reasonable. It was higher than the number that you indicated. In terms of isometrics, it is still early days in terms of where we stand on isometrics. We have one vessel fully converted to isometrics today and it started first survey in South Africa during the quarter. We actually haven’t seen a downtime on the vessel there. So our further plans for isometrics is that we will convert another vessel this year and a further two vessels in 2014. So we have surveys planned for both our vessels this year. the one that did the survey in South Africa is now shooting a survey up in the Barren Sea. It will move to Canada after that. Beyond that, we also have a fair bit of North Sea for that lined up. So we all take it as quite strong. But I think it is also important that we get the full set of result analyzed together with our customers before we really start talking about what the pricing premium should be. But the fact that there should be quite a decent pricing premium on these type of measurements there, it is very clear.. So it is still early days, but we are progressing, I would say, quite well and in line with our plan when it comes to isometrics.
Turner Holm - Rs Platou Markets: Okay, and just one quick related follow-up. On the multiclient, I guess we saw multiclient sales tick down to 175 in this quarter. I believe, first quarter last year you had about 215. I now multiclient bounces around a bit. But what can you say about 2013 relative to 2012 on the multiclients?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, at this stage we expect that there will be good progression in overall multiclient sales in 2013 over 2012. These thing vary a bit from quarter to quarter. Q1 was a little down sequentially but it was also, as you indicate somewhat down from Q1 of last year. but overall, we have a very strong library. I am quite convinced that the overall sales from our library in 2013 is going to be up from 2012.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the Frequently Asked Questions document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.08. This is flat sequentially and $0.02 lower when compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, all the prior year amounts have been restated as the Distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sales of Wilson and CE Franklin in the second and third quarters of this year. During the quarter, we recorded $0.04 of integration charges and $0.02 of charges relating to workforce reductions in connection with an initiative to rationalize global overhead costs. The Smith integration charges was a little larger than our historical run rate due to the fact that we incurred a number of agency terminations and facility exit costs during the quarter. Going forward, we do not intend to highlight these integration costs separately as they are not anticipated to be significant. Fourth quarter revenue of $11.2 billion increased 5.3% sequentially. Of this $567 million sequential increase, approximately half of this growth came from the year-end surge in product, software and WesternGeco multiclient sales that we typically experience in Q4. Oilfield Services' pretax income of $2.2 billion increased 1% sequentially. Pretax operating margins were down 83 basis points, as the positive effects of year-end product sales were not enough to overcome the impact of the higher-than-usual seasonal slowdowns in activity and contractual delays experienced during the quarter. Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $3.2 billion increased 8.2% sequentially, and margins improved 31 basis points to 29.1%. These increases were largely driven by the traditionally strong end-of-year software and market client sales, offset in part by the impact of lower WesternGeco marine vessel utilization. It is also worth mentioning that Testing Services, Wireline and PetroTechnical Services all experienced sequential margin growth as a result of more favorable revenue mix. Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.1 billion increased 2.2%, while margin declined by 128 basis points to 16.8%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to robust drilling and measurement activity in the Middle East & Asia Area, and the strong performance from M-I SWACO in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area. The margin decline was primarily due to contractual delays in IPM and an overall less favorable revenue mix. Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of $3.9 billion increased 6.8% sequentially as the result of strong completion Artificial Lift product sales across all areas combined with the new Framo subsea projects. Pretax margin was essentially flat at 15%, as the impact of the strong Completions, Artificial Lift, and Framo performances were largely offset by continued pricing pressure in U.S. land as a result of excess hydraulic horsepower capacity in the market. From a geographical perspective, North America margin improved by 65 basis points to 19.2%, while international margin declined 104 basis points to 20.5%. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.8% in the fourth quarter, compared to 23.6% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.1 billion, representing a $1.1 billion improvement as compared to the end of the third quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.5 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of approximately $850 million. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in our annual dividend to $1.25 per share. This follows last year's 10% increase and the 19% increase in 2011 and reflects our commitment to generate and return excess cash to our shareholders. During the full year 2012, we repurchased 14.1 million shares at an average price of $68.99 for a total of $972 million. We did not repurchase any stock during the fourth quarter as our buyback activity for the first 9 months of the year more than offset the dilution caused by our stock-based compensation programs during all of 2012. CapEx is expected to be approximately $3.9 billion in 2013 as compared to the $4.7 billion we spent in 2012, which included an acceleration of part of the first quarter of 2013 CapEx. And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Our fourth quarter results showed continued growth in key markets in addition to the typical year-end products, software and multiclient sales. However, while revenue grew sequentially by 5% to set a new record for the company, pretax operating margin slipped by 83 basis points, and I will elaborate on this as I review the operational results by region. Looking at the international markets, revenue grew by 6% sequentially, while margins were down 104 basis points from the 3-year high of last quarter. Overall service activity and product sales were strong during the quarter. However, results were impacted by the previously stated seasonal slowdown and contractual delays and also mobilization costs for several new projects. International service capacity remained tight in our Seismic, Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Well Testing product lines, while pricing in terms of revenue per rig continued its slow but steady progression during the fourth quarter driven by strong execution, new technology sales and proactive bidding on small to medium-sized contracts. In Latin America, revenue was up 11% sequentially, and margins up 30 basis points, driven by strong activity throughout the region. In Mexico, rig activity grew both offshore and on land, with additional coiled tubing and stimulation work focused on unconventionals, as well as a full deepwater well testing program. Activity in our IPM projects remained robust, and the ramp up in our Carrizo and Panuco SPM projects continued according to plan. In Brazil, we saw strong sequential growth, driven by our Seismic and Well Testing product lines, while overall offshore activity continue to shift from deepwater exploration in the Santos Basin towards development and production enhancement work in the Campos basin. In Argentina, activity also picked up during the quarter, driven by drilling and stimulation activity in the Neuquen basin and from the start up of a new IPM project in the Vaca Muerta shale. In Venezuela, we have, in recent years, actively managed our activity levels relative to our receivables balance. During the fourth quarter, we saw a significant slowdown in the rates of payments, and we are currently working closely with our customer to resolve the situation. In the Middle East & Asia, revenue grew by 10% sequentially, while margins were down 91 basis points, driven by activity mix and startup costs for several IPM projects in the region. During the quarter, we saw the strongest growth in the Middle East, where activity on both land and offshore in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates led to record revenue levels in these countries. In Iraq, revenue grew over 60% sequentially, also reaching an all-time high, as we started off the remaining rigs, leading to our recent IPM contract wins. Operational execution continues to be strong on our well construction project in Iraq, however, delays in obtaining the needed regulatory approvals impacted startup timing for several projects and consequently, profitability for the quarter. China again posted strong results, with the seasonal slowdown on land being more than offset by activity growth offshore in Bohai Bay and the South China Sea. The focus on unconventionals in China remains very strong. And based on the strategic moves we made in 2012, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity going forward. And in Australia, we continue to grow on the fourth quarter as rig activity ramped up further in our IPM project in the Queensland coalbed methane and also due to strong offshore drilling activity in the Northwest. In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue was down 1% sequentially and margins were down 203 basis points. In the North Sea, we saw the start of the seasonal slowdown, in particular, for seismic activity, which had a significant impact on the sequential results. However, we maintain a positive outlook on the North Sea for 2013, driven by both exploration and development activity in Norway and the U.K. In North Africa, further contractual delays also had an impact on fourth quarter results. While these delays continued into January, we expect the situation to be resolved during the first quarter. Sub-Saharan Africa had a good quarter on offshore activity in both West and East Africa. Looking at 2013, the outlook for the region remained strong, driven by East Africa exploration, Angola pre-salt activity and Gulf of Guinea exploration and development work. Russia and Central Asia saw flat sequential activity driven by the start of the seasonal winter slowdown both on land and offshore. However, we see solid growth in the coming year both in Western Siberia, the Caspian region and in Sakhalin, and the first arctic project is also expected to start up in the second quarter. In North America, sequential revenue was up 4% and margins were up 65 basis points, driven by very strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico. In North America land, our results were again negatively impacted by lower-than-expected activity in Canada and by an 8% sequential drop in the U.S. land rig count. In our hydraulic fracturing business, the lower pricing levels continued to penetrate our contract base and further impacted margins in the fourth quarter. In addition, with the drop in liquids activity, we also saw clear signs of pricing weakness in our drilling, coiled tubing and cased hole wireline product lines during the quarter. Still, the continued weakening of North America land margins was more than offset by strong activity and excellent performance in the Gulf of Mexico, where deepwater drilling activity reached pre-Macondo levels, as expected. In WesternGeco, we continue to operate 1 dual coil fleet in the Central Gulf, while multiclient sales saw the normal year-end increase driven by the Central Gulf lease sales scheduled for March of this year. Overall, our strong operational and market share position in the Gulf of Mexico is becoming increasingly accretive to our North American margins. Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, WesternGeco completed the first IsoMetrix season, which included 3 commercial projects. IsoMetrix results were presented at the SEG Annual Conference in November 2012, and the technology continues to attract a great deal of attention as exploration of difficult and complex reservoir prospects continues. The first Explorer Class vessel upgrade through IsoMetrix, the WesternGeco Vespucci, is currently under way and 2 IsoMetrix vessels will be available in 2013. In December 2011, we announced the purchase of the U.S. company ThruBit, which offers a cons down [ph] open hole logging suite that enables wiper trip logging of horizontal wells. In 2012, ThruBit saw a rapidly growing client base and a 93% increase in revenue. Recently, the technology has been successfully applied in the Bakken to optimize the stimulation design in the horizontal sections, helping to improve productivity and to reduce costs. In the Drilling Group, our Drilling & Measurements product line saw increased offtake of the NeoScope sourceless formation evaluation service. This technology offers a comprehensive suite of 12 formation evaluation measurements while eliminating the need for the traditional source and thereby reducing operational risks. The offtake has been widespread, covering North American shale plays, Japanese methane hydrates, conventional reservoirs in the Middle and Far East and remote deepwater exploration work offshore South America. In the Production Group, Well Services introduced the SPARK frac-through delivery platform in 2012, offering our vertically integrated customers access to Schlumberger's engineered fluid systems, such as HiWAY, while utilizing their own personnel and hydraulic horsepower. The offtake of the new offering progressed well during 2012, with over 1,100 stages sold through a growing customer base in both the U.S. and China, and we expect continued growth for this offering in 2013. Also in the quarter, we announced the creation of OneSubsea, a joint venture with Cameron to manufacture and develop products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market. This market represents a unique opportunity for growth, as the new joint venture seeks to create a step change in the reservoir recovery through integration and optimization of the entire production system over the life of the field. The integration of the production system will be accomplished by combining superior reservoir knowledge and wellbore capabilities with industry-leading subsea technologies, altogether delivering enhanced productivity, reliability and integrity. We anticipate closing the transaction during the first quarter of this year. Let's now turn to the macro environment, where there continues to be uncertainty. However, GDP growth outlook for 2013 remains in line with the previous quarter at the back of positive data points from China and the U.S. and a more or less unchanged situation in the Eurozone. Looking at the global oil market, 2013 demand is expected to grow at similar levels with 2012, excluding any major macroeconomic changes. The supply side will see further growth in North America, while the rest of non-OPEC production will likely continue to face challenges, leading to a fairly similar coal and OPEC production in 2013. Based on this, we do not see any major change in the global spare capacity in the coming year, and we expect Brent prices to remain in a broadly similar price band as seen in 2012. In the international gas markets, LNG prices in Asia are expected to continue to benefit from high demand in Japan and China, while in Europe, the impact of lower demand is expected to be offset by decline in domestic production, leaving the market balance relatively unchanged. Looking at our industry, there have been no material changes to overall customer activity plans or sentiments during the quarter, and we expect international E&P spend to grow around 10% in the coming year. Based on a favorable activity mix and continued focus on execution, we expect to grow our international operating income in excess of this number in 2013. In North America, we see continued market uncertainty going forward. U.S. land liquids activity is expected to recover somewhat in the first half of the year. But for the full year, we see U.S. land rig count slightly down versus 2012. U.S. natural gas production remains strong, and at this stage, we do not see a significant recovery in dry gas-related drilling activity in the coming year. Based on this, the industry will still be faced with oversupply of hydraulic horsepower. In addition, the lower rig activity in the fourth quarter has already created pricing pressure in many of the non-pressure pumping product lines in U.S. land, which will create further pressure on North America land margins moving forward. So in summary, we expect the overall market trends of 2012 to carry forward into 2013, with solid growth in international spending and strong activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with the offsetting factor being continued challenges in North America land. In this environment, our well-balanced business portfolio, wide geographical footprint and strong operational execution capabilities position us well to capitalize on these trends and to continue to show good growth in overall earnings per share. Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Paal. We'll now open the call for questions. Julie?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of James West with Barclays Capital.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So clearly, another good move higher this quarter for international volumes, but a little margin slippage, as you highlighted. It seems to me the contract delays, the startup costs, this is all pretty transitory. Is that accurate? And if so, take out the seasonal factors, I guess, for a second, when do those type of startup costs and delays, when do those abate, or have they already abated at this point?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I agree with you, the impact we saw in profitability in Q4 is down to mix some of these transitory delays and the seasonal slowdown, as you're referring to. So most of these issues are more or less behind us in terms of what was unusual for Q4. We will continue to see the normal seasonal slowdown in the North Sea, Russia and China land in Q1. And the only other lingering issue we have is the contractual situation in North Africa. But overall, the issues that were exceptional in Q4 are more or less behind us.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, good to hear. And then, we obviously agree with your international E&P spending outlook for this year. What do you see as the biggest growth areas for Schlumberger this year, and are there any markets that you think could be particularly challenging as well, excluding North America land?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if I look at international, next year, we will see the most significant growth in ECA and MEA. We will also see growth in Latin America. But the overall activity levels in Brazil is more or less flat year-over-year, so that will have an impact on Latin America growth. But if I look at ECA, we see significant growth, overall, in Sub-Saharan Africa, where we have a very strong position. And we also see quite significant growth in Russia. So I would say, ECA, the main growth locomotives next year will be Sub-Saharan Africa, and overall, Russia, both land and offshore. And then in MEA, I would say overall, the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, but also Kuwait, U.A.E., Oman, will all be very strong for us. And in Asia, it's predominantly China and Australia which is going to be driving growth.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to maybe hit you up on the North American front. And I know that there's still quite a bit of uncertainty on the U.S. land, but I think the indications are that there's going to be a pickup in some time here in the first quarter. So with the pickup in activity on the horizon, wouldn't it be safe to assume that margins would pretty much hit their low points in aggregate for North America land in the first quarter? And if not, can you just kind of walk us through how you see things evolving?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I'm not ready to predict exactly why North America land margins are going soft. There is one new element of uncertainty this quarter, which is further pricing pressure outside of hydraulic fracturing, right? But if you look at our view on 2013 for North America, we do expect the U.S. land rig count to be up between about 100 and 150 rigs in Q1, and this is based on the feedback from our customers. So that's in line with what you're indicating. Now in terms of activity for the full year, we still see U.S. land rig count slightly down versus 2012, while the well count will be slightly up. Now if you look at Canada, the rig count is already over 500 so far in January. But we still see the full year also being down in 2012 versus -- sorry, down versus 2012. Now then the other major uncertainty in North America land is pricing. So it seems clear that we will continue to face oversupply of horsepower given the rig count outlook. So we don't really see any significant recovery in hydraulic fracturing pricing in the coming year. And then you have the ongoing uncertainty where we saw about a 5% pricing drop on average in the other product lines on land in Q4. And this is going to have an impact going forward. But I would say, at this stage, the further evolution is not clear. And I think it's going to be a function of how quickly the rig count climbs back up going forward, right? So I would say that in North America land, there will continue to be margin challenges in, at least, in the coming 2 quarters as far as I see it.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Now as a follow-up -- thanks for that. As a follow-up, obviously, the Gulf of Mexico has kind of been a positive dynamic. Can you give us some indications of what you might expect for maybe revenue growth in the Gulf of Mexico year-on-year? And is that all going to be driven by this -- the Oilfield Services product line? Or is there going to be some combination of Seismic and services?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we expect both drilling-related activities as well as Seismic to be strong in the Gulf of Mexico for this year. If you look at the rig activity, we don't see any major rig additions in H1 after we had the surge of, I think, 7 additional rigs in Q4. But I mean, overall, rig activity year-over-year will be up more than 20% with that Q4 addition. In terms of Seismic, we are continuing to run 1 seismic fleet in the Central Gulf. You'll see what happens in terms of late sales leading up to the new sales now in March. But I'm also continuing to be positive on Seismic in the Gulf of Mexico.
Operator: The next question is from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Paal, I wonder whether you could just elaborate a little bit more here on OneSubsea. You talked about the importance of enhanced recovery at subsea a little while ago. You closed the deal. Could you, now that you have some time to reflect on it, help us understand a little bit more how having access to OneSubsea will change the core business at Schlumberger or enhance it?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think, first of all, the creation of OneSubsea will allow us to make a much more significant entry into the overall subsea business. We have some very good, I would say, niche technologies. And Framo have seen tremendous growth in recent years. But it was evident that we needed to combine that with a much broader offering. And I think Cameron is going to be an excellent partner for us in -- with that in mind. So I think it's a bit early to say exactly what the impact in the rest of the business is going to be. If you look at the rest of our business, a lot of that will be focused around the life of field part of subsea, around well intervention, which is not something that we immediately are going to focus on in OneSubsea. But the fact that we are much, I would say, deeper in sanctioning the business through this JV will allow us to move a lot closer to the customer side that focuses on these type of developments. So overall, I see it as a strong positive for us.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Does it enhance recovery as a tail end of a field? Don't you think it's the opportunity for Schlumberger through having access to -- I'm talking about the impact on Schlumberger's core business, not what's put into OneSubsea. Or is it getting involved early-stage in helping how to design wellbores and with based on the knowledge that you have from the reservoir side, and how that could impact the design of a field development? I'm still not sure if I understand exactly how it's going to enhance Schlumberger's business the most.
Paal Kibsgaard: It's a good question. It's actually both. So through the OneSubsea JV, we'll obviously be much more involved with the customer discussions around how to develop these fields. And that has to do with our reservoir characterization capabilities, and it also has to do with our, I would say, wellbore capabilities around ESPs and intelligent completions. So I think both the reservoir understanding as well as the wellbore capability that we have will be integral to how these developments will be done in the future. And then, you add a much more intelligent wellbore to a more sophisticated production plan, say, on the seafloor, including both boosting and compression, and potentially, separation, that is how the overall development, in my mind, are going to be done in the future. So we will have that early involvement, where, through the JV, we will potentially secure people with reservoir background and well background into the project teams. And then beyond that, you have intervention, and I would say, later feel the activities that we will continue to be involved with as the life of the field progresses.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So it sounds as if you are trying to lift Schlumberger's position versus the old company to a higher level at an earlier stage on how fields are developed. Would that be correct?
Paal Kibsgaard: That's correct.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Second question will be on IsoMetrix. Could you give us any kind of feedback from these initial studies on how they have helped your clients solve more complex issues? Are there any examples of that now?
Paal Kibsgaard: Why, it's still early days, right? We have done 3 commercial surveys in this season. I think the -- it will take a little bit of time to process the data, but the early indication from what we have seen from the data together with our customers is very positive, right? And the ability to, I would say, image the reservoir much more accurately will benefit, in particular, the prospects that are more difficult to image.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Well, finally, Simon, I'd just like to congratulate you on the helping reign in the CapEx there and drive free cash flow. And if you could also convince your guys to do some more buybacks, then I think that would be very good for the share price.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: First question, Paal, Simon, I don't know which of you want to address this one, but I do want to follow up on Ole's comment on the lower CapEx and in particular, as it relates to asset turns and the efficiency initiatives that are currently under way. There are 2 aspects in particular that I'd like to ask you to address. One is the reliability of the tools, and two is just overall utilization. Both seem to be going up quite a bit with revenue growth forecasts up and CapEx down. Could you speak to those?
Simon Ayat: Well, let me just -- yes, thanks, Michael. What -- let me take just the overall CapEx. So as we said, we will spend $3.9 billion in 2003 (sic) [2013] as compared to what we spent, $4.7 billion. And it is the shift of activity, obviously, that impacted our decision to lower CapEx. And we, in 2012, had accelerated a bit into Q4 what we were going to spend in 2013. But you are absolutely right. The efficiency plans and programs that we have will improve the 2 turns and asset turns that we experienced in the past. It is an early stage in 2003 (sic) [2013] to see a significant impact from this, but it is a plan that is going to take several quarters, if not years, to get to a -- an optimum situation. But it is reflected in 2013, but the major part in 2013 is really more of an activity shift, acceleration in 2012, and to a lesser extent, the performance that you referred to. But the performance eventually will be a major factor in determining the CapEx spent in Schlumberger and the -- between the different segments. Is this good enough?
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes, it's very good. And maybe, Paal, for the follow-up, I'm curious if internationally there are any signs of an emerging interest in tight oil or unconventional applications to conventional reserves or even shale oil? Is what's happened in the Bakken and Eagle Ford starting to go global yet?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think there's a general high interest of unconventionals in oil around the world. You find it in many countries. But where we stand today is it's still in early stages in most places. Whether it's all about data gathering, I would say, exploration in terms of can these resources be developed in an economic and viable way, if I look at the 2 countries, which are probably furthest down the road of -- on doing something that is more material, it is China and Argentina. And China is predominantly focused on shale gas at this stage, but I think there is more of a balance in Argentina between liquids and gas. So those are the 2 countries, which I think will see the most activity increase in the near term.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So from a field standpoint, it's still very much a gas focus, but is it fair to say that oil is perhaps sort of emerging from a science standpoint at this point? Or is it still too early?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think it's still too early to say how predominant that's going to be. I think the interest is there for the shale. There's a lot more data gathering and testing that needs to be done to see what's the balance between gas and liquids.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Scott Gruber with Sanford Bernstein.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: While the subsea tree market continues to grow, investors have been disappointed by a drop in Cameron's market share. Now that you had a chance to look under the hood of their business, what do you think are the prospects for a share gain in trees by OneSubsea? And what can Schlumberger do to help push for greater share of awards?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I don't want to make any specific comments about Cameron market shares or trees. I think we had a very good dialogue and discussion with Cameron in terms of their view of the market versus our view of the market. We have very coinciding views that it is very important to try to view something differently and focus a lot more on production optimization and recovery optimization. The tree will be a key part of that, but there's also a lot of other aspects around the subsea production plant, as well as I also referred to earlier, in terms of the wellbore technology and reservoir understanding. So when it comes to the situation around Cameron, trees, market share, I think you need to talk to Cameron about that.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Got it. And Simon, can you provide a split of growth or decline in the CapEx in '13 between North American and international?
Simon Ayat: The -- we're not going to go into all of these details, but the majority of the spend in 2013 will be related to international.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So will international be up a little bit in '13 then?
Simon Ayat: Yes, on an average, yes, it is up compared to 2012, and the reduction will be in North America.
Operator: Next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Paal, with regard to your outlook, you mentioned that your expectation was for international E&P capital spending to be up 10% and your growth in operating, international operating income to outpace the 10% growth in overall E&P capital spending. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations for international revenue growth? I would expect that you would also expect that to be up, outpace the overall growth in E&P capital spending as well. Is that correct or no?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think that's fair to say. I'm not going to go into the details of exactly what our numbers we are targeting. But I think it's fair to say that both revenue and operating income, we are aiming to grow that faster than that spend or rig count increase, right? And just for reference, if you look at our 2012 numbers, we grew revenue 16% internationally and operating income by 31% at the back end of a 8% growth in rig count. So I'm not saying we're going to repeat those numbers, but I think there is potential and we have capabilities of doing what I'm just saying.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Is there any reason to believe that your international incremental margins are going to be markedly different from the close to 35% number that you generated in 2012?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don't think there's any -- anything that is dramatically different in the international markets, 2013 versus 2012. While we can do the exact same incremental margins, we will obviously, continue to focus on doing that, but I'm not commenting anything at this time.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Okay. And then last one for me, can we talk a little bit about the Saudi outlook? Coming out of the third quarter call, you mentioned that activity in 2013 for Saudi was going to be strong, largely based upon the pretty considerable increase in activity over 2012 and persisting over the course of 2013. But you did not expect, if memory serves, for activity in Saudi Arabia to grow considerably in '13 versus exit 2012. Is that the same position that you have today?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think based on our discussions with Saudi Aramco over the past quarter, we have changed it slightly based on feedback. As you said, we ended the year on about 134 rigs, which was pretty much in line with the plan that Saudi Aramco laid out early in 2012. We saw very strong [indiscernible] activity, rig lift activity in Q4, and also, they're starting up a deepwater rig in the Red Sea in addition to the shallow water exploration that they have there. Now in terms of the outlook, we are expecting around 160 rigs, up from the 134. So 160 rigs by year-end 2013, and that's the latest rig count we have from Saudi Aramco.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: So the 160 versus 134 is actually considerably better than what you thought coming out of the third quarter call, correct?
Paal Kibsgaard: That's correct.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Angie Sedita with UBS Securities.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Paal, I believe you see China as one of your fastest-growing GeoMarkets in 2013, and it is already a fairly good-sized market for you. Can you talk about some of the opportunities there? And can you also discuss the traction you've seen with the Anton Oil joint venture?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I can. So if you look at the market trends in China, for a long time, we had a very strong position offshore in Bohai Bay. But on land, our market access has been more limited mainly due to the Chinese operators predominantly using their own Chinese service companies to do their work. Now with the unconventional activity and the many new players entering there, this really opens up the land market, and at the same time, we're also seeing higher demand for new technology and also, the IPM business model from our traditional Chinese customers as they embark on more complex land projects, right? So at the back end of these trends, we've done a number of strategic moves in 2012 as you know. The 20% stake in Anton Oil is one. The other thing we did with Anton Oil was that we formed a JV with them, focused on IPM projects and oil cost on China land. So it is still early days for that JV, but we are actively pursuing work, and it gives us another, I would say, entrance into the China land market.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, very helpful. And then on North America, you mentioned the 5% drop in pricing and your non-pressure product -- non-pressure pumping product lines in Q4. Are you still seeing softness in pricing in Q1? Are you seeing any slowing of softness in Q1? Or is it status quo?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I don't really have a lot of information yet on Q4 -- sorry, on Q1, so that's why I'm saying it's still uncertain. We saw that drop in pricing in Q4, which was partly lead to the softness in rig activity. So it's unclear yet whether that is going to continue down in Q1 or whether the rig uptick, which we are hoping to see, will stabilize it.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow on non-pressure pumping, given the softness in pricing, what would it take for you to consider unstacking equipment? Would you need to see long-term contracts? Or would you need to see better pricing?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we operate on the product of pricing and utilization, so if we can -- if that product is over our target or hurdle, we will reactivate fleets. We're not planning to do any of that at this stage, but we're obviously continuing to follow the situation closely. In Q4, we kept the crude count flat versus Q3, so we didn't lay down any more crudes in Q4.
Operator: Next question is from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Paal, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned not only in the press release but on your prepared comments regarding you're starting to at least be proactive on bidding on the small- and medium-sized contracts in terms of international pricing push here, and I'm just curious what kind of success rate are you having so far in making that push? And what's really driving that in terms of do you feel like now is the time to do that? Is it because we've pretty much booked, if you will, or is in the rearview mirror, the big, larger tenders that were a source of price competition last year? Those are behind us, it's now giving you a better fairway to go ahead and push more aggressively on these small- or medium-sized contracts?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I think that's fair. On the -- as we talked about throughout the conference calls in the past year, we have been pushing or testing pricing on these smaller to medium-term contracts, basically, throughout 2012. And I would say our success rate has been reasonably good. You win some and you lose some whenever you try to push pricing up. But I would say that overall, we are please with the contract win we have for those type of contracts and that type of pricing strategy. So you're right to say that on the large contracts, which is multi-service line and also multiyear, multi-rig, it is still quite competitive. But most of those contracts, we still represent a relatively small part of our overall contract volume. Most of those contracts are already bid. Not all of them are awarded, but most of them are bid based on where we stand in the cycle.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And I guess just one follow-up. I guess fair to say, Paal, given your comments around the operating income growth you see internationally, I guess, fair to think that your earnings growth 2013 versus 2012, you're still expecting that to be double digit, double-digit growth this year. Is that fair?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I would say, we're overall still aiming for double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2013, so this is assuming no major setback in the global economy and also, no further significant setbacks in North America, right? So I already highlighted the key growth drivers in international being ECA and MEA, while the offsetting factor is going to be what's happening in North America land. But yes, overall, we're still aiming for double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2013.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: If I could slip one more in. I guess everybody's trying to do the math in terms of just looking to North America performance and including the Gulf of Mexico contribution, is it fair to say, maybe Simon, is a question for you, 1/4 of North America revenue this quarter is coming from the Gulf of Mexico? Is it that high?
Simon Ayat: It's correct that the Gulf of Mexico includes the -- compensated for the drop in land, yes.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Right, but in terms of just a percentage of your revenue contribution in North America from the Gulf, it's about 25% this past quarter?
Simon Ayat: A little bit lower.
Operator: We'll go to David Anderson with JPMorgan.
David Anderson: Paal, you had mentioned the increase in Saudi rig count this year. Can you characterize about where that growth is coming from? Is that primarily natural gas related?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I don't have the details of it. There is some -- obviously, there's some natural gas in it, but it's obviously still oil as well. So I don't have the breakdown for you. I have the breakdown in terms of drilling and workover. The 160 is about 117, 118 on drilling and the balance of 42 being workover.
David Anderson: Okay. And can you discuss kind of some of your unconventional workover there? Is that starting to become a bigger part of your business over there? Are you sort of in some kind of reservoir characterization stage? Or are you starting to kind of go at these wells and starting to look at doing some horizontal wells this year or you're expecting to?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I'll leave most of the commentary to how Saudi Aramco wants to communicate around their unconventionals to them. But we are involved with the project, which is still largely in the exploration type of phase, right? So still, it's limited in terms of oil activity, what we are involved with.
David Anderson: Okay. And if I could just -- completely unrelated follow-up, on your North America market, you talked about your SPARK initiatives some more contributing this quarter. Can you just kind of give us a sense as to basically how many kind of pressure pumping fleets that would represent? In other words, how many fleets are you not using and using and applying SPARK? And also, who are the ideal customers for these initiatives?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So if you look at the number of 1,100 stages, it's obviously a very big number at this stage, and that number is also split between China and the U.S. So it is not a significant part of our overall capacity or revenue that is coming through this model, but we see that's an interesting model, as we continue to develop these engineered fluid system or frac fluid systems. So overall, today, it is not significant, but it's a new business model that we believe could grow to be more significant over time. And the type of customers that review it, this is typically the either smaller independent players who wants access to higher-technology frac fluid systems or vertically integrated customers that we do this for.
David Anderson: Okay. I guess my last question, kind of related to that is there seems to be quite a bit of a shift in operator behavior in North America over the last 6 months. What would you attribute that to? We hear a lot talk about budgets being used up and whatnot, but is this something that's about field economics and their efforts to lower service costs? And if so, where do you think they are in terms of their goals of cost? Are they satisfied where service costs are now? You just mentioned pricing on some of these other products have come down. That sort of implies to me they're not really satisfied. How do you think about it in terms of their economics right now?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say all the customers in North America that I'm talking to are still looking for us to help them drive more cost out of the system, whether that is efficiency or technology. Exactly what transpired in H2 or in particular, Q4 in terms of the lower activity, it could be a combination of lower commodity prices in terms of the subset reference prices below the WTI. I also think that a number of these customers have been operating north of 100% cash flow, and they felt it was prudent to scale back, and then also, you had quite a significant impact of the holiday season in Q4. So I think all of these elements were contributing towards the drop in activity. So I don't think there's been a really material change to the economics, but I think that the proof of that is going to be what happens now in Q1, whether they're going to be ramping back up again.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Paal, how do you see seismic vessels supply/demand and pricing shaping up for the spring/summer season?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at -- our overall market outlook for seismic remains positive. The capacity in the market still remains tight. If you look at our bookings for Q1, we are more or less fully booked, and Q2 is filling up relatively fast. So most of the pricing -- sorry, most of the bids that we have won for Q1 and Q2 are more or less at the same pricing that we did at -- in Q3 and Q4, which is it's about 10% up from that reference price of 2011. So there hasn't been a further increase in pricing as of yet, but we still see the opportunity now to cut pricing further for what remains to be a book for Q2 and also for H2. So we remain positive in terms of our outlook for the market. I'm not really concerned about all the capacity in the market at this stage.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And my follow-up question, Paal, is for the formation evaluation business in deepwater, I think your competitors were targeting a big push in that area given that this is the most exciting growth area in the global oil service market. Do you feel now that we're sort of well into this upturn in deepwater, with still -- a big part of it's still ahead that you've maintained your market share globally in terms of from doing FE work on ultra deepwater wells?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I'm very comfortable with both our technology portfolio, how they continue to execute in these type of projects and overall, the rate that we are winning work at, right? So I don't think there's been any negatives around this. And in fact, I think we continue to perform very strongly, both in terms of market share, revenue growth and profitability. So I'm pleased with the progress that we're showing on the formation and valuation side on deepwater.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: And is this in the area, Paal, that could show above average price increases, too?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, pricing is already quite strong in these types of environment, linked to the higher rig rate and also linked to the high -- with the high importance our customers are putting on operational integrity and reliability. So it could be that we could see more pricing power there, but I would say pricing there is already quite strong.
Operator: Next question is from Jud Bailey with ISI Group.
Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Follow-up question on the Gulf of Mexico, you highlighted the strong growth in North America offshore. I was wondering if you could give us some sense -- obviously, there's some seismic in there in the Gulf. And [indiscernible] me if I'm wrong, but you include Canada and Alaska in there. Was all that or stop between seismic in the Gulf of Mexico? Or was there any big contribution from like Eastern Canada or Alaska in that offshore revenue increase?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, they are included in -- when we talk about offshore in North America, but both Alaska and Eastern Canada are relatively small compared to the size of our Gulf of Mexico business. I would say the predominant driver of the sequential increase in revenue is the Gulf of Mexico.
Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then another question on Mexico. As international markets go, it looks like it's going to be one of the more positive ones for 2013. Could you give a little color or insight as to how you see that market developing over the next couple of years between some of the onshore activity and then -- and now they're getting more active offshore as well and what product lines?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I mean, overall, we're seeing pretty solid growth in activity in 2013 for Mexico, both land and offshore. There is deepwater activity going on. There is conventional shallow water activity, and then you have a range of types of activity on land, all the way from the unconventionals in the North. You have normal third-party work, and we have the IPM and SPM type of contracts. For 2013, in addition to the growth in activity, what we're also seeing is we are facing significant tendering activity in the next couple of quarters. What we're also seeing now is that several smaller players from U.S. land is starting to show up in Mexico, which could make the whole tendering environment even more competitive. So we'll see how that plays out. But that's one aspect that we are looking at. The other key for Mexico is also that PEMEX continues its overall transition towards the production incentive type of contract. And we really like this model, and we compete quite well in those type of bids. And the latest we've heard from PEMEX is that the Chicontepec SPM bid round is expected to be around midyear of 2013, so we'll obviously be preparing for that.
Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And if I could just have one more quick follow-up, Paal, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. In your comments earlier, did say you anticipated about 100 to 150 rig increase in the U.S. rig count in the first half of the year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Based on the customer feedback that we've had, we are saying up between 100, 150 rigs in Q1. That's what we heard from our customers.
Operator: Next question is from Brad Handler with Jefferies & Company.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I'm going to stick with the U.S. as well, please. You spoke about, I think, raising your stage count in the fourth quarter of '12 for hydraulic fracturing. I wanted to confirm that, please. And then I suspect that you think that the stage, that, that was a nice move in market share for you. I would imagine you think that with activity being down the way it was on the rig side that stage count was probably down for the industry. So can you confirm that and maybe quantify for us? And then we can talk about how we got there.
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I didn't mention anything about stage counts for Q4. I would just say that we haven't thought anything around that. I would say that, overall, in hydraulic fracturing, we have had a good, I would say, couple of quarters in terms of securing work, so I wouldn't be surprised that our market share could be up somewhat. But in terms of stage count sequentially, I haven't mentioned anything about that.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: All right. Maybe I misread it or misheard. No problem. I guess, then, let me just -- an unrelated follow-up, I suppose just more broadly on IPM, maybe asking globally, how might you expect that revenue to compare in '13 to '12?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think IPM is one of our faster growing product lines. We see a range of type of projects that IPM is getting involved with, all the way from just straight integrated service or project management for, say, deepwater drilling offshore, where we simply coordinate the interface without taking any project management risk to the project, but when we have a wide range of services on these remote rigs, for instance, that coordination will -- is one thing that IPM takes on. The other part is the traditional turnkey well construction, which continues to also grow in time for us, right? So we are very active with IPM, and it's doing very well for us.
Operator: And we have time for one final question from Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: The -- after the Q3 results, the commentary you guys had around kind of security and political turmoil concerns in North Africa and Mid East were kind of relatively muted in terms of your concerns overall for the region. Can you just talk about how that's changed in the last 3 months if any?
Paal Kibsgaard: Obviously, with events of the last peak here [ph], we are -- we're relooking at the whole situation there. It is -- if you talk about Algeria and Libya, they're already operating there with quite stringent security measures in banks. With what has happened in the last week, we are relooking at that. We are very prudent in how we go about doing business in any part of the world to make sure that we can offer up the required security for the people that we put into workforce there. So it's too early to say exactly what the impact of this is going to be, but I would just say that in these regions with high risk, we already have very stringent security measures in place.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question, unrelated, Paal, you mentioned around Venezuela and receivables and the payments there slowing. Is that -- does that change your appetite for taking on revenue at this point or is it just something that you're throwing out there as an item to be aware of?
Paal Kibsgaard: It is an item to be aware of. We are -- we have a long-standing relationship with Petrovesa. There is -- there are some challenges that they are facing in the country at this stage. We are committed to Venezuela for the long term. They have a massive resource base, and we want to be there for the long term. So we are currently just working very closely with them to kind of resolve the situation.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Third Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call from New York City today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the frequently-asked-questions document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.08. This is an increase of $0.03 sequentially and $0.12 compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, all prior-period amounts have been restated as the Distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sale of Wilson in the second quarter and the sale of our investments in CE Franklin during the third quarter. Third quarter revenue of $10.6 billion increased 1.5% sequentially. This increase was driven by international revenue growth of 3.1%. The international growth was offset in part by 2.3% decline in North America. Oilfield Services pretax income of $2.1 billion increased 2% sequentially while pretax operating margins were essentially flat. Sequential revenue and pretax margins highlights by products groups were as follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $2.9 billion increased by 4.8 percentage points sequentially, and margins improved 58 basis points to 28.8%. These increases were driven by improved reservoir utilization at WesternGeco, following last quarter's transits and dry docks, as well as a strong international performance in Testing Services. Drilling Group third quarter revenue of $4 billion increased 1.2% while margins declined slightly by 34 basis points to 18.1%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to Drilling & Measurement on robust activity in the Middle East and Asia. Third quarter Production Group revenue of $3.7 billion decreased 1.7% sequentially while pretax margin fell 148 basis points to 14.9%. These declines were largely attributable to our North America hydraulic fracturing business, as we continue to experience pricing pressure in U.S. land as a result of excess hydraulic horsepower capacity in the market. From a geographical perspective, North America margins declined by 209 basis points to 18.6% while international margins improved 73 basis points to 21.5%. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.6% in the third quarter compared to 24% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $6.2 billion as compared to $6.7 billion at the end of Q2. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.1 billion of CapEx, $121 million of proceeds from the divestiture of our investments in CE Franklin and $149 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average price of $68.19. In addition, during the quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $1 billion of 1.25% of 5-year notes due in 2017 and $1 billion of 2.40% 10-year note due in 2022. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011. And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Our third quarter results continue to show steady improvement in both revenue and margin performance as seen in the overall pretax operating income, which was up 2% sequentially and 11% compared to the same quarter last year. In the international markets, total revenue grew by 3% sequentially, in line with the rig count while margins were up by 73 basis points, reaching a 3-year high. Activity was solid, driven by both key land and offshore markets. However, regional growth rates continue to vary, driven by changes to activity mix and project schedules. Service capacity remained tight in our Seismic, Drilling & Measurements and Wireline product lines, and we also saw signs of capacity tightening in our Well Testing business. Pricing continued a steady upwards trend during the quarter, driven by higher new technology sales, strong operational performance and further supported by proactive bidding on small- to medium-sized contracts. In Latin America, revenue was flat sequentially while margins were down 113 basis points, driven by a shift in activity mix, operational delays and heavy mobilization costs linked to new contract startups. In Mexico, activity remained steady during the quarter with continued focus on deepwater exploration, conventional offshore development and mature fields on land. We start operations on our -- in our first Schlumberger production management, or SPM, project covering the Carrizo Field, and we also began to mobilize for the second SPM project covering the Panuco block. In Brazil, activity was also flat during the third quarter with growth on land being offset by less offshore drilling as rigs were redirected towards work-over activities. Still, the growth outlook for Q4 is positive with 3 additional deepwater rigs scheduled to start operations, together with higher forecasted stimulation vessel activity. Ecuador saw strong sequential growth as we completed the mobilization of the Shushufindi SPM project. The project is now fully operational and activity and results are progressing in line with our plans. During the quarter, we experienced operational delays in Argentina and Colombia, due to a range of local factors, but we are expecting to see solid sequential growth in these countries in the fourth quarter. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially while margins were up 126 basis points. During the quarter, Saudi Arabia again posted strong sequential performance, driven by work-over, development and exploration activity. These results were further supported by solar activity growth in Oman, the United Arab Emirates, as well as Kuwait. In Iraq, we completed our resource mobilization following the second quarter contract wins, effectively doubling our drilling activity in the country during the quarter. With this market share gain and our well-established execution track record, we have, over the past 2 years, established our traditional international market position also in Iraq. In China, we continue to see strong sequential growth on land, driven by higher drilling and stimulation activity as our Chinese customers embark on more complex conventional and unconventional projects. Still, the GeoMarket with the fastest sequential growth in the third quarter was Australia, where offshore activity increased and where our strong contracts position in the Queensland unconventionals is starting to have an impact. Following a very strong second quarter, revenue in Europe/CIS and Africa grew by 2% sequentially while margins were up by a further 138 basis points. In the North Sea, we saw strong activity at WesternGeco, which was offset by startup delays on several smaller projects for other product lines, as well as extended summer maintenance shutdowns in both Norway and Denmark. In North Africa, delays negatively impacted results in Algeria while issues related to the security situations slowed the activity ramp-up in Libya. Activity in Sub-Sahara Africa remained strong during the third quarter with significant sequential growth in East Africa. Russia and Central Asia also saw strong sequential performance, driven by activity growth in Western Siberia while offshore activity remains flat for the quarter. In North America, sequential revenue was down 2%, and margins were down 209 basis points. In terms of activity, the results were negatively impacted by a slower-than-expected seasonal pickup in Canada, a 3% sequential drop in the U.S. land rig count, as well as the activity shutdown in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico linked to Hurricane Isaac. The negative pricing impact on our hydraulic fracturing business in U.S. land continued in the third quarter as the new pricing levels further penetrated our contract base. Furthermore, in U.S. land, we also saw the first signs of pricing weakness in our coiled-tubing business towards the back end of the quarter. In the Gulf of Mexico, excluding the Hurricane Isaac impact, deepwater activity grew in line with our earlier outlook and the number of deepwater drilling rigs is set to reach pre-Macondo levels by the end of the year. We continue to show strong operational performance, and our Gulf of Mexico business is becoming increasingly accretive to our North American markets. In WesternGeco, we operated one dual coil fleet in the central Gulf while multiclient sales were flat with the previous quarter. Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, we opened the Schlumberger China Petroleum Institute in Beijing. The institute houses more than 100 of our petro-technical experts, which, together with domain experts for most Schlumberger product lines, offer a full range of reservoir services to the various players in the Chinese oil and gas industry. To further strengthen our position in the emerging shale market in China, we also signed a joint venture with the Chongqing Institute of Geology & Mineral Resources to provide basin studies, subservice data integration and optimize well and completion planning for the new players coming into the Chinese shale market. Elsewhere, we continue to expand our presence and capacity for core and fluid analysis with the opening of our latest lab in Houston, which joins our network of over 25 labs around the world. We are also continuing with our strategy of combining our downhole fluid and core-sampling technologies with our lab capabilities to provide a seamless, integrated service. In the Drilling Group, we continue to execute our strategy, focused on creating the next step-change in drilling performance through total system integration, and we are progressing well with this work as can be seen by the improvement in the Drilling Group financial results over the past 2 years. During the quarter, we reached a significant milestone where Smith Bits, for the first time in their history, captured the #1 market share spot according to the latest Spear's survey. This achievement is another testament to what the Smith segments can achieve through their unique technology and as part of Schlumberger, both with respect to the overall drilling workflow and our global infrastructure. Another very interesting drilling technology being introduced by Geoservices is the advanced couplings characterization. Here, we performed continuous petrophysical measurements of the couplings as they come off the shakers. And through novel data processing, we can establish the reservoir quality of the rock and also tie it back to the specific well depth. This will offer a very effective way of optimizing well placement and completion intervals, for instance, in horizontal shale wells. In the Production Group, we performed close to 2,100 stages with HiWAY way during the quarter, which represents record activity and a sequential growth of around 60%. In addition to the established HiWAY markets in North America, such as the Eagle Ford, we also saw meaningful penetration into several other basins, including the Bakken and in Canada. HiWAY's production results and completion cost savings have been the main driver for its penetration into these basins. We also completed a study of public production data covering the Eagle Ford that show that average production from the HiWAY wells was 65% higher than non-HiWAY completed wells. In the international markets, HiWAY saw continued growth with a near doubling in stage count versus the prior quarter. Let's then turn to the macro environment, where both the U.S. and European Central banks announced interventions to support growth in their respective economies. China continued to show signs of slowing growth, but so far, the slowdown appears to be actively managed and, for the time being, kept under control. Altogether, these developments have left the GDP growth outlook for 2012 and 2013 more or less unchanged from the previous quarter. At the same time, the supply and demand balance of the oil market remains tight with continued production challenges in the non-OPEC countries and with OPEC spare capacities staying close to a 5-year low. Based on this environment, we continue to see Brent crude prices reported around current levels, although there could still be periods of volatility. In the international market, we have seen no material change to overall customer activity plans or sentiments during the quarter, and we still expect our activity to grow in excess of 10% this year. In North America, the activity sentiments are currently more negative, both in Canada and U.S. land, with liquids activity no longer able to offset the drops in dry gas drilling. This, coupled with ongoing pricing pressure in hydraulic fracturing, as well as early signs of pricing weakness in coil tubing in U.S. land, indicates no immediate change to the North American headwinds. As we continue to navigate the overall macro uncertainty, manage the North American headwinds and capitalize on the steady international growth, we maintain relentless focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution. This execution capability, together with our balanced technology portfolio and unmatched international strength, will allow us to deliver double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2012, as well as solid margin progress, in what remains quite a changing business environment. This position and these capabilities also put us in the driver seat for continued outperformance in 2013, which remains the collective ambition of the entire Schlumberger team. Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Paal. We'll now open up the call for questions. Julie?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] With that, we'll go to line of David Anderson with JPMorgan.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Paal, question, international performance, particularly out of Eastern Hemisphere, is very impressive this quarter, particularly how it has progressed over the last year or so. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the drivers behind that. How much of this would you attribute to, say, execution, activity levels, pricing? And I guess what I'm really trying to understand is how much of this momentum do you see continue into 2013, in other words, is it sustainable now and we continue to build from here.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So if I started with the Q3 performance, I would just say that I'm overall pleased with the progress. We are keeping very strong focus on execution as we have been talking about in earlier quarters, and we also are doing quite well when it comes to cost and resource management. We also continue to work on our internal improvement programs, which, by the way, is included in our normal operating cost. So in terms of margins, we saw further progression in Q3, and we had very good incrementals. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our international margins is now at a 3-year high. Some of the drivers behind this is slow but steady pricing increase, driven by new technology sales, as well as strong operational performance. But I would also say that the quality of service is still a market share driver for us, right? The D&M Q3 replacement ratio was again 34:3. So we're maintaining this 10:1 ratio, and this is actually starting to become meaningful for D&M now, which have shown significant improvement in financial performance during this year. So if you then take that performance and try to look forward, we maintain our positive view on international markets and also our performance there, right? We have a very strong international contract portfolio, and this portfolio has solid upside when it comes to both technology and the performance. And the other thing I would like to highlight as well is that we continue to expand the international presence of our smaller product lines. If you look at operations internationally today, we operate in over 80 countries and we have 17 product lines. But in 50% of these countries, we only have 50% of our product lines present. So I would say that we still have a lot of runway in terms of growth and as per market penetration. So in terms of margins going forward, I would just say that we will continue to leverage the size and the infrastructure and the execution capabilities to drive both the top line and further margin expansion. So as overall -- I mean, our view on the international market remains positive, and I'm pleased with the progress in terms of how we're executing. And I would expect us to continue to improve going forward.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: More specific questions, just Saudi, if you don't mind. How do you see Saudi market develop in the next several years, and how much of their growth is going to come from gas? I mean, I know we're not going to see the huge massive ramp-up we saw last cycle, but we're hearing more and more talk about gas being one of their focuses up there. So I'm just kind of curious, how much of gas do you see that big -- as a contributor there? And can you give us a sense as to how much that gas market in Saudi has grown over the last year?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don't have the breakdown of the rig increases that we've seen over the past year, right? But Saudi today is on track to reach 134 rigs by year end, which they, more or less, indicated. In terms of the outlook beyond year end, we don't expect this -- a dramatic increase in rig count, I would say, in the first half of next year. But rigless activity remains strong and is also a key growth driver for us in Saudi. But like you said, gas is important. Saudi Aramco recently announced a gas discovery in the Red Sea, which -- there's no firm plans beyond this. But with the gas discovery, I think it's reasonable to assume that there'll be more exploration activity around that. And there's also a lot of gas-related activity in the Northwest, linked to both tight gas and shale. So you're right to point out that gas is important, and I would say that gas, in terms of future growth in Saudi, is probably going to be one of the key drivers.
Operator: The next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Paal, I was just wondering if you might be able to provide us some perspective on -- you guys put out some very strong performance here relative to your peer group over the last couple of quarters. Maybe provide some perspective on how you plan on maintaining that performance differential going forward. And then in addition, some of your -- some commentary we've recently heard for some land drillers and from some of your competitors are calling for an uptick in activity in the U.S. market, U.S. land drilling market, going out into 2013. If you could give us some perspective on the outlook there, that'd be helpful, appreciate it.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So the first part to your question was related to North America as well?
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just globally, really. It looks like your performance overall for revenue growth, margin performance, et cetera, has been exceeding your peers over the last couple of quarters.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So if I -- if you go back to the first question, I answered that. I think a lot of the elements of our international performance I covered there. So maybe I just focus in a little bit more on North America.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, fair enough.
Paal Kibsgaard: So if you look at Q3, overall, again, solid performance for us in Q3. I'm pleased with the progress. Since we restructured our business about 2 years ago, we now have a very lean and focused North American organization. We have invested quite strongly in infrastructure over the past couple of years. So we are now able to leverage that. And we also -- after the Smith merger, we now have a very broad technology and workflow offering in the North America land marketplace, which we are also able to leverage. And finally, what I would say on the means we have to succeed, we probably have one of the best supply chain organizations in the North American market as well. They have done a really great job in particular, together with our pressure pumping organization, this year. So -- further on performance in North America, if you look at how we have been addressing the fracturing market, more or less from the beginning of this year, we have kept focus on what we call minimum effective margins. This is basically the product of our bid price times the utilization. So if these effective margins go below a certain level, we are prepared to lay down crews. So we laid down crews in Q2. We also laid down crews in Q3, and this is how we are able to protect better, I would say, the margins in our pressure pumping business. Now in terms of the other product lines on land, we continue to have solid performance both from Drilling and Wireline. Obviously, the Gulf of Mexico remained strong for us and was, in Q3, highly accretive again, even with the Hurricane Isaac impact, and this is with flat seismic sales quarter-on-quarter. Now if you look at the North America market going forward, from our standpoint, the -- on the plus side, we expect to see continued strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico from us, both when it comes to drilling activities as well as seismic. And we also see Canada having a positive impact for us in Q4 and Q1, although not to the same level it had in the previous year. Now on the negative side, fracturing margins are going to come down further in Q4 and likely also in Q1 as the new pricing levels work its way through our contract volume. But -- and also -- as I also mentioned, we also see some margin pressure in coiled tubing. Now what's going to happen beyond Q4 or Q1, I would say there's really 3 main questions in my mind. Firstly, will there be a Q1 recovery in liquids rig count after Q4? This is key to maintain the current land pricing overall, both for frac-ing as well as for the other product lines. The second question is will there be a share place in the frac markets and a new pricing floor, given the fact that there are significant excess capacity in the market, and also, when the guar leaf comes, is this going to be another source of market share place. And then the third question in my mind is in terms of how North America, overall, is going to perform, what are really the normalized frac margins. The way I see it or we see it, the frac market in North America today is largely a commodity market with a very low barrier to entry, where capacity is really driving the pricing. And we peaked at around 30% margins, and the trough is now in low single digits. And I would say, in my mind, that the normalized margins are more in the middle of this. They're certainly not towards the upside. So I think these 3 elements, obviously, are going to be important to sort of guide us in how the North America market is going to continue to evolve. But I would say I'm very optimistic, though, in terms of our ability to outperform on a relative basis in North America.
Operator: We'll go to the line of James West with Barclays.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Paal, as we think about 2013, I want to dig in a little more on Dave's earlier question. Given the large number of startups and staging for contracts, it's underway now, which I guess, first off, makes your margins look even more impressive, but there's a lot of work that's been awarded to yourself and the industry that's getting underway now. That should lead to significant growth in '13. I'm talking more on the international side, of course. Do you see international growth in '13 consistent with '12, or could it be above or below?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think in terms of the activity, like our outlook for international, it's still a little bit early to kind of pin it down in detail, right? We are just entering our planning process, and our customers are doing the same thing here. So I would just say that we maintain a positive view in international markets. We see growth in 2013, and I think the rate of growth, I think, is going to be much clearer by year end. But again, we have not seen any major shift in customer sentiments over the past quarter. So unless there's a dramatic change in their view of the market and their spend at the commodity planning cycle, we are optimistic that it's going to be more of the same for next year.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then on seismic, which has been an area of strength this year. It seems like the fourth quarter is mostly -- or close to sold out at this point on the marine side, and that would set up for a good 2013. Are you continuing to see good pricing gains on the Seismic side? And am I correct that the fourth quarter is mostly sold out, that that should lead to a very strong '13?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I think that's correct. Q4 is more or less booked, as you say, largely driven by South Atlantic activity, both West Africa and, for us, Uruguay. So our view hasn't changed. We were indicating that we didn't think that Q4 would see the normal seasonal low, and that's actually transpiring. So going forward, we continue to test pricing for 2013 work. We already awarded some work for the next North Sea season, and the pricing is even up from what we have bid earlier, right? We are now pushing about 15% versus the 10% that we talked about earlier. So overall, we maintain quite positive view on the seismic market.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Scott Gruber with Sanford Bernstein.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Simon, a question for you on initial CapEx thoughts for '13. Baker's come out and guided for a big 25% reduction. Halliburton was out earlier, guiding for a decline as well. Are you anticipating a reduction in spending levels next year?
Simon Ayat: Paal just mentioned that we're going to -- we're going through the planning cycle. And I'm going to turn it over to Paal to tell you what the initial numbers that are coming, but we are going through a planning cycle as we speak. And there is a bit of shift between activity places that might require additional CapEx. But Paal have a little bit input now at the early stage?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So firstly, 2012 CapEx spend is going to be around $4.5 billion, as we said, which is in line with the plan that we previously communicated. The main shift we've seen during this year, going back to what we were planning at the beginning of the year, is that we have significantly reduced NAM CapEx, and this has been offset by higher international CapEx. So as Simon was saying, the 2013 CapEx spend outlook, it's still early days. We are just starting in the planning cycle now. But I would say as a general view, at this stage, I would say CapEx would be likely flat to slightly down. The main drivers or the main focus for us in 2013 is going to be the international market, and it's going to be a traditional high-capital service segments, like WesternGeco, Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Testing. Now while we continue to inject capital into these businesses, we also continued to drive efficiency and utilization for all of them to make sure that we can be as lean as possible with how we spend our cash, right? The other key thing for us next year in terms of CapEx is that we are -- we're also continuing to invest further in infrastructure, in particular in Sub-Sahara Africa and also in the Far East, in particular in China. And the last part as well, as I mentioned, we're looking to further expand our smaller product lines into the international market, and there is some associated CapEx with that. But overall, I would say, at this stage, CapEx is likely to be flat or slightly down.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And if I stood back and think about the broader environment, thinking not just about '13 but into '14, are we entering a period of declining capital intensity now that the big spend on U.S. pumping is over? I've realized there's still roofline investment going on abroad, but sounds like that's going to be flattish, maybe down, relative to this year. And it looks like, too, that the big spend on international shale operation is still a few years off. So if you look at CapEx relative to sales or cash flow, do you anticipate, potentially, a few years of declining capital intensity?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I wouldn't stretch it further than 2013 in the comments that I made. But I think your commentary around investment into pressure pumping capacity, I think those are fair. We have enough pressure pumping capacity at this stage to go around for a while, right, and, I think, so does the overall market. And you're also right in saying that the volume of international unconventional activity is not likely to sky rocket very -- anytime soon. With that said though, the investment into our high-end service line, such as WesternGeco, Wireline and Drilling & Measurements, in particular, for deepwater and exploration type of activities, there's lot of CapEx that goes with these activities. And the returns, both in the capital and the return on sales, is obviously very good to that. So if the market is there, we will happily invest into those businesses and as long as we get the right returns.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: But the investment in Seismic is primarily technology, not vessel spend right now, correct?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we have 2 vessels under construction, which will be delivered in 2014, where a significant part of the CapEx associated with those vessels will be taken in 2013. Also, as we continue to ramp up the coverage of IsoMetrix on our seismic vessels, that will also be a significant CapEx spend, right? So the Seismic over the next couple of years will be a significant CapEx spend for us, provided the market continues to head in the direction we see now.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Back to the international outlook for a second and recognizing the fact that, as you mentioned, the outlook for '13 should begin to crystallize much better towards year end, but it doesn't -- it's not all that obvious to me that the IOCs, even with very generous oil prices, are generating significantly abundant cash flows, surplus cash flows, which leads to the same rate of growth that we saw this past year. I'm curious as to how -- just conceptually, how growth rates in '13 could match 2012 if the cash flow generation is going to be less generous. And then -- I mean, is the swing factor the NOCs, the greater sense of urgency on the part of Petrobras, more catharsis in West Africa, greater uplift in Saudi? How do we match those growth rates year-over-year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Sorry. First of all, I'm not saying we would match the growth rates. I'm just saying that we maintain a positive outlook on the international market, and we see growth in 2013 as well, right? So it is still -- typically, we don't even talk a lot about the coming year and the -- after Q3, we typically leave that to January. But like I said, we are -- we maintain a positive view on next year. I think it's probably better to look at -- so maybe you can switch from activity and revenue to earnings, right? And I would just say that we obviously continue our focus on growing total earnings, and that's through both the top line and margins. And I would say that assuming no major negative change in the global economy and no further setbacks and a second lag down in North America, we are, at this stage, aiming for double-digit EPS growth in '13, right? And that would be a combination of top line growth, as well as margin improvement. So I think it's too early to kind of break it down to look at what the IOCs and the independence and the NOCs are going to spend next year, because we really don't have the data. But we are aiming for double-digit EPS growth in 2013.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Okay, that's fair. And then secondly, with regard to sort of coming back to the near term here. You mentioned you're not going to witness the same seasonality with regard to the contract business, thanks to good bookings in the South Atlantic margin. Do you have a window into the outlook for year-end multiclient sales at this stage in the Gulf of Mexico?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, not really, other than that there is a lease round in November in the western Gulf and there is another one, what, in March in the Central Gulf. Typically, the way the fourth quarter goes when it comes to multiclient sales, it's down to the last week of December when we finalized the last major sales, right? So it's difficult to say what it's going to end up on. But I would just say that in North America or in Gulf of Mexico, there is a lot of positive sentiments around the outlook for the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling rigs continue to rise. We will be at pre-Macondo levels by the end of the year. The lease rounds that are announced, I think, is a positive. So we maintain a positive view on the business there, overall. So I would expect there would be a good multiclient sales in Gulf of Mexico in Q4, but it's going to come down to the last week of December.
Operator: Next question is from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Paal, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit more about Canada longer term here. By our math, it probably is still north of 10% of your North America revenue stream. And I think what we found there's been some conjecture on whether or not this lower rig count has been more transitory here as opposed to something structural changing within the Canadian market. As we look out to next year, I know you mentioned earlier that you're aggressive in rightsizing your North American operations. But as you see Canada going forward here, do you feel like you're profitably rightsized for how you see the longer-term activity there in that market? Or do you think the industry, as a whole, is frankly probably overcommitted to that market at this time?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think we were a bit surprised when we looked at the -- when we saw the recovery in the rig count over the past quarter. We were expecting it to be pretty much in line with last year, right? Now this is a combination of high gas storage levels, as well as weather and structural conditions, right. So like I said before, we're expecting growth again for Q4 and Q1, but the activity levels are going to be well below last year. With that said, I think, overall, Canada they have a lot of resources, both on conventional gas liquids as well as heavy oil. So there will be a lot of activity, I think, in Canada going forward. We have, in my mind, a good setup there, and we will continue to invest into it as the market evolves. Where we probably have more opportunity going forward is in the heavy oil, which I think we are less represented than we are, for instance, in the shales and on the -- in Eastern Canada. But overall, the -- we maintain a positive view on Canada.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. So as you see it going forward, you're rightsized properly for that -- for the activity levels you forecast and actually be looking maybe to put some incremental services in there?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes that's correct.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: My follow-up would be just -- as we think about international just near term, is there anything, Paal, that would alter the view of kind of what we saw in 4Q as we think about the seasonal uptick that you typically get in your business from your own product sales and the like, that fourth quarter revenue growth, internationally, should be pretty strong here as we look to 4Q?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. No, we don't see anything largely different than what we would expect in previous years. So there's typically an uptick in fourth quarter sales, both linked to software and, say, hardware completions sales, as well as multiclient. So there's always some variation and uncertainty what happens with respect to those sales. But overall, we expect that to occur again this year.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Because as I look at fourth quarter '11, you were up high single digits in Eastern Hemisphere, third to fourth quarter, that's probably not unreasonable to think about for 4Q this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I haven't looked at the numbers. But I would say that a similar type of uptick as we saw last year is not unreasonable to expect.
Operator: We'll go to line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Paal, I wanted to follow up on some comments that you made back at the last Analyst Meeting in Boston with respect to the supply chain and procurement initiatives. Can you give us a progress update as to how far along you are vis-a-vis those targets and perhaps some indication of the impact that that's had on the P&L thus far? I know it's a big part of the execution program, but focusing more on the cost side of the equation as opposed to execution on the field.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So I think if you split it into quality and efficiency, I would say the quality part, we have worked on now since 2008, 2009, and it's starting to have a meaningful impact in terms of the overall reliability of our services, right? And that's -- you see that, in particular, in a segment like Drilling & Measurements. So that is part of why I believe we are superior when it comes to execution strength from a quality standpoint. Now the other parts that I referred to over the last quarter was more linked to the efficiency side, and this has much more to do with the internal things like asset utilization, transportation, shared services and this type of things. I would say we are much -- in a much earlier stage of capitalizing all those benefits. You always get some lower hanging fruit as you start focusing in on things. But these programs are multiyear, and we will see gradually fruits of them coming forth in the coming years.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you remind us of what the targets are for that program.
Paal Kibsgaard: I -- we have targets but I haven't shared the targets, and I don't intend to share them.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. The other question I had was with respect to the shale workflow. As we're moving from a horsepower-driven market, everybody's trying to differentiate themselves, and one of the common terms that we've heard just in the last few months has been around the notion of workflow. Can you address the competitive advantages you -- that you think that Schlumberger has in -- with respect to workflow?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. We've been talking about workflow now for a couple of years. So, I find it interesting to see that the broader industry is now taking up the concept and also want to take part in it, right? So the advantages we have is starting off with Reservoir Characterization and our ability to basically establish 3-dimensional models that can predict variation in shale quality, similar to what we can do in conventional reservoirs. Now when you have that capability, you can, firstly, place your wells in the right position aerially. And secondly, when you evaluate the quality of the rock in the horizontal section, you can also complete the parts of the horizontal section which is most likely to actual flow. Today, there's a significant part of the horizontal section that are frac-ed that never actually flows anything, which means that the frac itself was probably a waste. And then the last part also has to do with how you frac these wells. Today, we create a very deep fracture network, and we only are able to prop a small part of it, which means that all the horsepower and the water that you use to create a deeper fracture is also a waste, right? So I would say that we have a very clear view on where the waste in the current process is, and we have technologies and workflows that can help our customers address these. We see a further uptake of these technologies and these workflows in North America. And for the projects that we are involved in internationally, which are more exploration or appraisal focused, we always use these workflows overseas.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: If you had to sort of gauge growth internationally versus, say, penetration of the workflow domestically, which would grow faster do you think?
Paal Kibsgaard: I -- it's difficult to say. I would say, in the international market, the two markets that I would say would have the most meaningful activity growth in the coming couple of years would be Argentina and China. And it's interesting to see now that YPF seems to be quite eager to pursue the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina. So there's a fair bit of rig activity moving into the Vaca Muerta. And I think in that sense, we are a lot more optimistic on the activity outlook for Argentina, at this stage, than maybe what we were one quarter ago. And you also seen some of the moves we have been making in China recently, and that's again at the back end of our view that China also will see a good growth in both tight gas and shale gas going forward, right? So to what extent that is going to generate growth versus the penetration in North America? I think it's a bit of a toss-up. But I would say more and more customers in North America are interested in the shale workflow and the associated technologies that we have to go with it.
Operator: Next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Paal, you recently made some very positive comments regarding the clearly attractive subsea markets, and certainly, I understand you maybe in the early stages of looking at opportunities. But 2 questions. Would potentially a JV or an alliance with the subsea production company make sense around the now wholly owned Framo business? And two, given that you do now own Framo outright, would you consider bidding directly on subsea separation opportunities in the offshore market?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. When it comes to, generally, how we -- what we will do in the subsea market going forward, that's something that we're still evaluating, right? So I wouldn't provide any specific comments on any plans that we may or may not have in terms of how we address the market going forward. What I wanted to do when I put subsea on the agenda earlier this quarter was just to indicate our view on what the opportunity in subsea is. And a lot of the opportunity evolves around the fact that the recovery rates are, on average, half for subsea developments compared to what conventional topside developments are. And if you look at the capabilities we are -- we have in terms of subsurface understanding, modeling and prediction, the ESPs, the intelligent well completions and Framo, as you rightly point out, we have a lot of the ingredients that can help drive recovery from these type of developments, right? So would we bid directly or independently on processing projects? We would have to look at how big they were and how we potentially could align ourselves with other players that have some of the capabilities and some of the, I would say, technologies that also needs to go into that project, right? But we are undertaking a number of significant projects with Framo already, some of them we highlight in the press releases that we send out every quarter. And I would just say that Framo, as it is today, is one of our fastest-growing product lines, and they are at the cutting edge of technology. So as it is today, we are very pleased with how it’s performing.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: No, fair enough. Great business. And then as a follow-up or a separate question, thoughts on Mexico and Russia for 2013, both of them appear that they could be a bit stronger with new opportunities, specifically in Mexico, and what type of opportunities do you see next year in both areas.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. As we started with Mexico, I would say that we have quite a positive activity outlook on Mexico, driven by both land and offshore, and offshore both shallow water and deepwater. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico activity for PEMEX continues, and we have a significant presence on that. There is also continued focus on mature fields in Mexico and a potential for more SPM activity. And there's also now more focus, again, on the shales in the north region as well from the PEMEX side. So I would say that the overall view on Mexico is quite positive for us going into 2013. When it comes to Russia, quite similar, also positive. We expect to see, again, continued growth in Western Siberia, where we have a very strong position through our local presence there, and then you'll have continued exploration activity, for instance, in the Baltic and the Bering Sea. And we also see very solid activity for Sakhalin and the Caspian regions. So you're right to point out Mexico and Russia as positives going into 2013.
Operator: We'll move on to line of Brad Handler with Jefferies & Company.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Let's see, maybe you can speak a little bit, guys, to SPM. You just touched on it with Mexico, I know. But can you give us a sense as to perhaps the run rate in the third quarter, how that compares to where it was a year ago or a couple of years ago on the top line?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. We don't disclose those details on other than -- we have -- if you look at the number of projects that we have won and are in the process of taking on at this stage, we are, I would say, significantly up in terms of overall activity and also, overall, the number of barrels that we actually manage, right? So a lot of the contract wins that we've had have been in Latin America. The Shushufindi project is the -- probably the biggest project that we've ever taken on, and the ramp-up has now been completed. We're operating 5 rigs in this project, and we are pretty much on track for the work program and the -- for the production profile that we laid out to achieve. The other project is in the Carrizo project in Mexico, where, again, we are just in the process of mobilizing now or are more or less finished and we are starting to mobilize for Panuco. So overall, I can't give you the exact number for revenue or for production. But we split SPM out from IPM about a year ago, and we did that to put a lot more focus onto these production incentive contracts because it is a differentiated growth opportunity for us, given the capabilities we have here. And also, the margins for this type of business is highly accretive to the overall margins of the company, and that's why we are continuing to pursue them. Now the overall sales process for this type of project is quite long. There's a lot of due diligence work needed to go in. And I would say that we are not -- we're not accepting every opportunity. If we're not satisfied with certain elements of how these contracts are set up, we will turn them down. And we have turned down contracts, even recently, that we decided were not good enough for us. So this is all about portfolio management and risk management, and we will take our time in terms of how we grow the business. But there's a lot of opportunities out there, and we will continue to pursue them.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: You anticipated a couple of follow-on questions anyway, but I'll sneak in another one in the same area.
Paal Kibsgaard: Sure.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: The -- maybe you can give us some sense of the degree to which, as it sits today, with what you won? There is a performance kicker tied to SPM. Or how integral is that to your selling process? Do all of them have performance bonuses, presumably based on production increases and the like?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. All the SPM projects are performance based. If it's only turnkey drilling or normal contracts, we don't classify them under the SPM product line. So this is where we are typically paid on a fee per barrel. So we will invest the value of our products and services. We will agree a decline curve with our customer. And the production that we will generate through our investments on top of that decline curve, we will get a certain fee per barrel for. And that's, overall, how we are paid. And that's why, generally, this will generate cash for our customers, and there are ways -- this is a way for them to unlock maybe aging assets that is not really a priority for them to spend their cash on. And then that's why this is quite a good business model. Now in terms of how this will be a growth avenue for us going forward, it's still a relatively small part of our business. But again we continue to focus on it, and we will continue to grow it in a -- I would say, in a somewhat conservative way.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Fair enough. Is it -- do you think it's relatively less or more capital intensive than the balance of your business? Simon, have you looked at it specifically that way?
Simon Ayat: No. The capital associated with SPM project is not more than our regular business. What is more than our regular business is sometimes you have investments upfront, and this is part of the overall evaluation of the project and how we will -- how much is the cash flow required upfront and the investment. And the investment is not in CapEx, the investment in services that are spent ahead of time in anticipation of the uptick in the production and, therefore, the additional revenue that we'll generate. We are very conservative on how we will account for these projects, and there is a regular evaluation of the potential of the additional revenue and additional production that will basically compensate for the initial investment.
Operator: The next question is from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Paal, I think in your remarks you talked about new Wireline tool introductions in the quarter. And your largest competitor also talked about that this morning, and theirs was focused very much on the deepwater, and then in return, and they mentioned the Gulf of Mexico. Can you talk a little bit about what your new Wireline tools are that you're introducing and what market they're earmarked for?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, the -- if you look at the 2 latest that we have introduced, is the Dielectric Scanner and Litho Scanner, is all part of the scanner family. So the Dielectric Scanner is focused in on formation evaluation in carbonates and heavy oils and mixed salinity. So these are special type of measurements with relatively broad applications, as you see, right? And the Litho Scanner is, again, a formation evaluation measurement linked to shale, which gives you shale composition and also total organic content, right? So what we are trying to do on the formation evaluation side in Wireline, at this stage, is to focus in on these, I would say, complex reservoirs or unconventional reservoirs in terms of formation evaluation, both in terms of fluid determination as well as the composition of the rock. So those are the 2, I would say, latest and 2 main introductions that we've done recently.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And as a follow-on, if the domestic rig count, domestic meaning U.S. land rig count, were to fall by another 10%, would you consider Wireline or LWD prices to be at risk of going down under that scenario?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I think if the overall North America land rig count was to drop by 10%, I think I would be concerned about the ability to hold pricing on the other services on land, that being Drilling or Wireline, right? Like I said, we're already seeing some early signs of weakness in coiled tubing. Whether that is going to continue or it's more of a Q3-Q4 effect, which will bounce back next year, it's too early to say. But it's really the first product line that we have seen pressuring so far. The other ones are holding. But you're right to point out that if the rig count was to go down, overall, further, then I think there might start to be pressure on the others. We haven't seen anything yet, but that is something that I would probably worry about.
Operator: We have time for one final question from the line of Jud Bailey with ISI Group.
Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask about a couple of markets. Paal, you mentioned in your prepared comments some of the work you're doing in China. And I was wondering if you could give us a little more color just on that market, how we should think about it in terms of growth opportunity and what kind of product lines you're utilizing the most?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So the -- what's happened in the China market recently is that there's a lot of drive, I think, from the government to develop the unconventionals, both the tight gas as well as the shale gas. They're importing LNG at very high prices, and they have a significant unconventional gas resource in the country, which they are very keen to develop. So tight gas remains the main focus of the 3 main Chinese national oil companies. But shale gas, the government has classified not as hydrocarbon but as a mineral. And when it's classified as a mineral, the -- it is basically open for any other company to bid for licenses and actually go ahead and do work. So there's a lot of interest from other type of companies, whether it's utility, coal companies or just private equity companies, to come in and take licenses in shale and to start developing them. Now a very few of these have any capabilities when it comes to reservoir evaluation or actual well-side execution when it comes to these things. They don't have their own service companies, which the 3 main Chinese companies have. So that's the opportunity for us to have significantly more penetration of the shale market in China as it evolves going forward. And this is, again, why we have made some of these moves in terms of joint ventures. So the joint venture with Chongqing is linked at the reservoir evaluation standpoint, while the joint venture we signed this quarter with Anton Oil is more focused on IPM activities around well construction and frac-ing of these shale gas wells. So there's a reservoir aspect to it, and there is the full portfolio of drilling and production-related activities that goes with it as well.
Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's interesting. And would you say the better opportunity is it market penetration? Or just the growth of the overall market itself?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think it's actually both. In the past, we've had limited penetration because the state oil companies have their own service arms. We do some of the high-end activities for them. We help them out with certain things. But there's a lot more opportunity in the shale now for these other players to do a much more significant part of the work, so I think that's where the opportunity lies.
Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Right. And my last question is just on Brazil. They've taken -- Petrobras has taken delivery to lot of deepwater rigs the last year or so. They're going to get more active in some of their presalt development, but another initiative of Petrobras is trying to stem some of the production declines at -- in Campos. And I just wondered -- I was curious if you could share your view on that market and the opportunities for growth, and to what extent you may be talking to Petrobras on some of their production issues.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I would say that, just in general, the -- we maintain a positive view on Brazil. There has been delays in terms of rig startups, rig arrivals during this year and also when Petrobras turned some of the -- their deepwater capacity towards production. That obviously impacts our drilling rate and product lines as well, right? But they are putting priority on, like you say, stemming the decline and getting production back up again, so that makes sense. And we will work with them in whatever capacity we need to, to help them out with that. But overall, Brazil is going to show good growth going forward. There are probably going to be some bumps along the way, but we are there. We have a very strong presence. We have a very good relationship with Petrobras, and we'll work with them the way they want us to.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call from Paris today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.05. This is an increase of $0.09 sequentially and $0.19 compared to the same quarter last year. All prior period amounts have been restated, as the Distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sale of Wilson and the sale of our investment in CE Franklin. Oilfield Services second quarter revenue of $10.4 billion increased 5.3% sequentially. Pretax income of $2.1 billion increased 8% sequentially, while pretax operating margins improved by 50 basis points. Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows: Second quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $2.8 billion, increased 7.4% sequentially, and margins grew 223 basis points to 28.2%. These improvements were driven by a seasonal rebound in SIS, combined with strong performances in Testing Services and Wireline. In fact, every technology in the group experienced sequential revenue growth and margin expansion. Drilling group second quarter revenue of $4 billion increased 5.7%, while margin improved 107 basis points to 18.4%. These increases were largely attributable to the Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust international activity. Second quarter Production Group revenue of $3.7 billion increased 5.6% sequentially, while pretax margin fell 117 basis points to 16.4%. The revenue growth was led by Artificial Lift, Completions and Schlumberger Production Management. The margin decline was largely attributable to our North America hydraulic fracturing business as a result of the spring break-up in Canada and continued cost inflation and pricing pressure in U.S. land. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 24% in the second quarter compared to 23.6% in the previous quarter. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for a full year of 2012 to be in the mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $6.7 billion as compared to $5.8 billion at the end of Q1. This reflected an increase in working capital requirements to support the current and anticipated business growth. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.1 billion of CapEx, $681 million of acquisitions, $906 million of proceeds from the sale of the Wilson business and $499 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.52 million shares at an average price of $66.30. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011. And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Second quarter results continue to strengthen, driven by a solid growth in activity and by consistent focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution. In the international markets, overall revenue grew by 9% sequentially, while margins were up by 161 basis points. Activity showed strong sequential growth, both offshore and in key land markets, while service capacity tightened further, in particular, in the areas of seismic, wireline and drilling services. We continued to test pricing on smaller contracts during the second quarter with good success, and for some customers, we also secured work at pricing premiums due to the quality and consistency of our performance. In Latin America, revenue grew by 5% sequentially, while margins were up by 79 basis points. We experienced strong growth in Mexico, driven by IPM activity on land and by our Wireline and Drilling product lines offshore. During the quarter, the second round of production incentive contracts were awarded, where we, in partnership with Petrofrac, won the contract for the Panuco block, covering 4 oilfields in the north of Mexico. In Ecuador, equity -- activity was up significantly as we started operations on the production incentive contract for the Shushufindi field. The project mobilization has been flawless, and the work program is progressing on schedule. In Brazil, activity remained flat during the quarter. However, a number of new rigs are being commissioned, and we are ready for activity to ramp up in the second half of the year as the rigs become operational. There are still a number of large bids outstanding, which will likely be awarded in the coming quarters. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially, while margins were essentially flat. During the quarter, we saw further growth in rig and rig-less activity in Saudi Arabia, and we also saw a noticeable pickup in activity in the United Arab Emirates. In Iraq, activity growth in the second quarter was limited as predicted, while we went through a very active bidding period. Building on the execution track record we have established in Iraq over the past 18 months, we secured most of the key new contracts awarded. Resources for the new contracts were successfully mobilized during the quarter, and we are positioned for good growth in Iraq in the second half of the year. In Asia, China posted strong sequential growth on land, driven in part by seasonal pickup in activity. We are also seeing increased demand for our high-end services, as well as for IPM, as our Chinese customers embark on more complex land projects for both conventional and unconventional resources. In Australia, we saw strong seasonal pickup in offshore activity in the second quarter. The offshore growth is set to continue in the second half of the year and be further complemented by additional land activity in Queensland and start-up of a new project in Papua New Guinea. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew by 14% sequentially, while margins were up 356 basis points, driven by strong activity and execution. The North Sea posted significant sequential growth, both on the U.K. and Norway side, with continued good exploration activity and strong growth in development. In Libya, activity continued to ramp up as new rigs became available, and we returned to double-digit profitability during the quarter. Sub-Sahara Africa growth was driven by high exploration activity in Mozambique and Tanzania, as well as strong exploration and development work in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea. In Angola, activity remained more or less flat this quarter, but we expect both exploration and development projects to continue to ramp up during the second half of the year. In Russia, we saw seasonal pickup in activity, both in Sakhalin, the Caspian and Western Siberia. And based in the current outlook, Russia remains on track to be one of our fastest growing markets this year. In North America, sequential revenue was down 2% and margins were down 208 basis points. The results were impacted by the Canadian break-up and the U.S. land hydraulic fracturing market, but were partly offset by our other U.S. land businesses and by our activity in the Gulf of Mexico. In U.S. land, the overall rig count remained more or less flat, while rig moves from the gas basins to the liquids-rich basins continued. Pricing and activity for our Wireline, coiled tubing, and Drilling businesses in U.S. land remained stable. The impact of the Canadian break-up was in line with expectations, and the Canadian rig count was, at the end of the quarter, at the same level as last year. In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity grew in line with our outlook for the year and our operational performance remained strong and consistent, while multiclient sales were flat sequentially. As we predicted, the downward pricing trend in the hydraulic fracturing market continued in the second quarter and also spread to other liquids basins. During the quarter, hydraulic fracturing margins declined further as a function of lower pricing and higher product costs. Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, WesternGeco introduced the IsoMetrix technology, a new class of marine services that measures the wavefield in 4 components, using a new streamer called Nessie-6. The output data corresponds to towing conventional streamers less than 10 meters apart, turning a 12-streamer vessel into the equivalent of 144. The result is the industry's first real 3D seismic measurement, and the resolution of the data is like moving from a 2D X-ray to a 3D CAT scan. IsoMetrix will be able to extend the role of time-lapse 3D surveys, enable wider tow patterns that record superior data for exploration, as well as eliminating the need for dense streamer spreads. This summer, we will also release the latest version of our new reservoir simulation software, INTERSECT. Schlumberger has collaborated with Chevron for over a decade to build, test and deploy INTERSECT, and Total has recently joined the collaboration as a full partner. INTERSECT represents significant advances in physics modeling and use of parallel computing to better represent complex subsurface structures. It also includes a more advanced and comprehensive field management framework. In the Drilling Group, we introduced the NeoScope logging-while-drilling service, which eliminates the need for chemical sources by using pulsed neutron generator technology. The NeoScope service offers a full suite of sourceless formation evaluation measurements, as well as well placement and drilling measurements that help optimize the drilling process. During the quarter, we also bought the remaining shares of the Russian company Radius Service, after having been a minority shareholder for the past 7 years. Radius Service is the market leader in engineering, manufacturing and service of downhole motors and drilling tools in the Russian land markets, employing around 1,000 people and operating in all major oil and gas producing regions of Russia. In the Production Group, we introduced the Mangrove stimulation design software that enables better decision making for well completion and fracturing programs. The software helps optimize perforation and stage design for horizontal wells using reservoir measurements and also includes fracture network predictive models. Developed on the Petrel software platform, Mangrove users can access the shared earth model to facilitate program designs for all types of reservoirs, including unconventional resources. During the quarter, Framo Engineering secured another major contract, this time for the Shell Draugen Field in the North Sea. As the clear leader in subsea boosting and metering, Framo now represents one of our fastest growing business units, with around 75% annual growth in 2012 and with a backlog at record levels. Let's then turn to the macro-environment, where the continuing Eurozone crisis, coupled with the disappointing numbers from China and the U.S., has led to downward revisions of the outlook for GDP growth and oil demand. High production output from OPEC also led to a period of crude inventory buildup during the quarter, which, together with fares [ph] or lower demand, brought Brent crude prices briefly below $90 before recovering. At the same time, global spare capacity for oil is at the lowest level for 5 years and there continued to be risks of potential production disruption from geopolitical events. The situation in the global economy remains unsettled, and it seems increasingly clear that the present macro uncertainties will remain for a considerable period of time. In this environment, we believe Brent crude prices, in general, will be supported around current levels, although they could be subject to periods of considerable volatility. Continued macro uncertainty coupled with price volatility could make customers more cautious in terms of future activity plans. However, in the international markets, we have seen no signs of this so far. We maintain, absent a future significant setback to the world economy, our stated view that international activity will grow in excess of 10% this year. In North America land, liquids-based activity continues to grow, offsetting the drop in natural gas activity and keeping the overall U.S. land rig count more or less flat so far this year. However, a WTI oil price in the low 80s with continued market uncertainty could impact the rate of growth in liquids activity in the second half of the year, although we have not seen any signs of this so far. In terms of natural gas, we expect the U.S. dry gas rig count to level off around 500 rigs until the current production overcapacity is consumed. In the midst of the uncertainty, we maintain our focus on what we control, which is the planning and execution of our work. To further extend our leadership in execution, we are currently undertaking a number of multiyear programs that cover a wide range of internal and external activities. These, together with our international strength and our balanced portfolio in North America, should enable strong relative performance going forward. Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Paal. And we'll now open the call for questions. Kathy?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So my question here really relates to very good sequential improvement in North America, despite the significant headwinds in the frac market as well as the seasonal downtick in Canada. Gulf of Mexico was flat. Seismic didn't really contribute much. So really, I was surprised by the strength of your other businesses in U.S. land. And given your outlook for the second half of the year, do you think it's reasonable, even in a flat rig-count environment, that Schlumberger can continue to show sequential improvement in the back half of the year, both in revenues and margins in U.S. land? And can you give us a little bit more color around what's really driving that improvement?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, just to clarify, the Q2 performance, we had very good performance in the Gulf of Mexico, the rig-related businesses, while the multiclient sales were more or less flat with Q1. So I would say that the Gulf of Mexico had a positive impact on the overall results, while multiclient sales were basically flat. Now we also had steady activity in pricing in the Wireline and Drilling businesses on U.S. land, while the Canada break-up impact came in as expected. So the main downwards pressure we saw in addition was the continued pricing and cost challenges in hydraulic fracturing. So whether the nonperformance from our side on U.S. land is sustainable, I think it's too early to say. I think it's going to be mainly a function around what the rig count is going to be. I think it's very clear that the hydraulic fracturing margins are going to continue down in Q3. We are still bidding lower in the liquids basins as of today. So if you look at it, both liquids and gas pricing is now about 20% down from the peak, and quite a few of these contracts have not yet been implemented. So I would say the liquid -- the margins in hydraulic fracturing is coming down. And to what extent we can offset that will obviously be a function of continued activity in the Gulf of Mexico, and we are heading into the hurricane season, which also brings some uncertainty. So we're obviously well positioned to offset the hydraulic fracturing, but to what extent we can do it is still a bit uncertain.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And you had some significant great performance in Europe, Russia and Africa. It seems like it was pretty evenly distributed. In the second half of the year, you've mentioned that Russia is going to be your fastest growing market. How would you characterize the North Sea and Africa relative to Russia as you head into the back half of the year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I said that Russia -- as we indicated at the beginning of the year, we had identified Russia to be one of our fastest growing markets. What we said was that within ECA, sub-Sahara Africa offshore and the North Sea offshore would be significant growth drivers. We continue to see them as strong growth drivers in the second half of the year. And at the same time, in ECA, we had North Africa land and Russia land generally as strong growth drivers as well, and we maintain those views. Now all these growth outlooks and expectations, we have to tie in this whole, overall macro uncertainty, as I mentioned in my prepared notes. But overall, the market progressed in Q2 as we were expecting in the international market, and ECA, I think, did slightly better than what we were expecting.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Barclays.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Well, I wanted to ask you a question about one of the comments you made towards the end of your prepared statements. You were talking about, I guess, in the press release and your comments, about the solid execution for the quarter, which was pretty obvious in the numbers. And you highlighted additional actions to really extend this leadership position. You already have, of course, industry-leading margins in North America, it looks like now, and of course internationally. And I'd like, I guess, if you could perhaps elaborate on what these both internal and external actions may be, and if possible, what kind of additional leadership that could add to your margin profile.
Paal Kibsgaard: I'll give you a brief outline of what they are. So generally, they are focusing on both operational quality and operational efficiency. So I think we mentioned earlier that we've had a strong focus on the quality of operations now for a number of years. Actually, we started this Excellence in Execution initiative back in 2008, driving quality. And if you look at our nonproductive time in our worldwide operations at this stage, we are now about 50% down compared to where we were when we started off back in 2008. And this is driven by the engineering and manufacturing of our products and making these more reliable. It's also driven around the investment in training and competency management and also a very strong focus on project preparation and process discipline. What we have augmented this Excellence in Execution drive with recently, or more recently, is the initiatives around operational efficiency or cost management, right? So this revolves around global supply chain and category management. We have a significant part of our organization occupied with shared services and transactional activities, and also things around asset utilization and global distribution. So all these elements, given our size and our footprint and our reach, represent a significant part of our cost base. And by driving efficiency even in small percentages with such a sizable organization, has a direct -- quite a meaningful impact to the bottom line, right? So -- but I would say that most of these or all these projects are multiyear projects, and you will see gradual impact over time.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, okay, that's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on the pricing side. You elaborated on gaining some pricing traction in the market and getting a premium for some of your services. Did we see the benefits of that in the second quarter? Is that going to be second half and '13? So I guess what I'm asking is, is there more margin uplift from pricing coming?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we saw some impact of, I would say, international pricing in the quarter, right? So I indicated in the Q1 call that we saw pricing sentiment starting to turn more positive. And I think that trend continued during the second quarter, also driven by strong growth in activity, which leads to further tightening of capacity. We continue to test pricing on these smaller contracts with actually quite good success rate during the second quarter. And also, we saw more technology sell-up within the existing contracts, which has a quick fall-through to the bottom line within the current quarter, right? I would say the other key thing that we observed during this quarter is that the high offshore rig rates and in projects with tight project schedules, we see our customers elevating their focus on operational excellence and willingness to actually pay for it, right? And this enabled us, in some cases, to win contracts at very good pricing premiums due to the quality of our performance. So Q2 was a step in the right direction, provided that the macro uncertainty doesn't have a negative impact going forward. I think it's reasonable to believe that this could continue into the second half of the year.
Operator: We'll go next to Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Paal, I have to just get a little bit more color on that very last thing you said there, win contracts with -- despite considerable pricing premium. Could you just elaborate a little bit? Is this -- how wide and what technologies? And where do you see this ability?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, in the contracts where we manage to secure a contract at pricing premiums, a lot of this has -- revolves around, I would say, Wireline and the Drilling segments. So this is -- in terms of the number of them, I mean, it's not prolific around the world yet. But at least we see a correlation between higher rig rates and more focus on operational excellence from our customers, where the actual pricing they pay for our services versus the negative impact of poor performance from the services they buy, they put a lot more focus on that.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Whereabouts -- any geographic nature to this? Any area where this is more common?
Paal Kibsgaard: Now, you would typically see this in highly complex offshore type of operations around the world...
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: [indiscernible] your competitors make some very aggressive claims with respect to market share gains, whatever. Are we seeing certain competitors not being able to perform? Is that it, people are out of capacity and not able to execute what they have taken? Or are there other reasons?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I don't know what the drivers behind their results, but I would just say that we continue to replace our competitors on key projects and on key rigs. So this whole focus around operational integrity and quality is, I would say, is now become quite a significant market share driver. So we've been quoting this D&M replacement ratio number over the past couple of quarters. And that number, again, this quarter, was 39 to 6. So we replaced our competitors 39 times. We were replaced 6 times. So that ratio is maintained. And I would say that the driver behind that is being able to perform within the contracts that you initially win. So the key is to win the contract on reasonable pricing to allow you to invest and perform. That's really the only way to maintain the contracts in the international market.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And you're doing that with incremental pricing power?
Paal Kibsgaard: Oh, yes, we are not going in to replace our competitors at their pricing or at the average pricing. We need a premium to do that.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just then to my real question, which was actually more about North America. Did you get helped sequentially by multiclient sales or any other kind of factor that artificially -- not artificially, but more one-off type kind of goosed up your North America margins?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, multiclient sales in North America were flat sequentially. So we had strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico in terms of the deepwater operations overall. And that obviously helped, but it wasn't -- there wasn't a significant boost. We were hoping to see a significant boost around the June lease sales. That did not really materialize. So multiclient sales were flat sequentially. So there weren't really anything exceptional in North America this quarter.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then finally on IsoMetrix, I mean, you're creating quite a stir in the industry now with this technology. Can you talk a little bit about the testing phase implementation of this technology adoption? I presume given this is, I think, the biggest R&D project in the history of Schlumberger, you want a big -- you want to be paid for it. So what do you think the customer willingness will be to pay up for something that is traditionally viewed as a commodity?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, it's a bit early to say what they're willing to pay for. You're right in saying that this is one of the biggest engineering projects we have undertaken as a company. And with those kinds of investments and with the value that this technology is going to bring, we obviously want to be paid a fair price for that in relation to what value it brings. So our plan for this year is that we are going to run one vessel with the IsoMetrix streamers on -- or the Nessie-6 streamers on, and then we will do a ramp-up next year. We haven't really finalized the plan for CapEx investment in this for next year, but I'm quite confident that we are going to be able to get a good pricing premium on this technology in the market.
Operator: Your next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Continuing with the seismic theme, Paal, positive outlook extolled by everybody and yet the WesternGeco backlog was flat quarter-on-quarter. How do we reconcile those 2?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don't think our backlog was flat.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: It was flat to up. It wasn't up markedly, I don't think, I mean, perhaps -- yes.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. Well, I don't really have any specific comment on the backlog other than we maintain quite a positive view on the outlook for the market. If you look at the Q2 results, they were pretty much in line with what we were expecting. We took the opportunity to reposition some of our vessels and also to do some dry dock maintenance of them. But beyond that, utilization was quite good. Looking forward to Q3, we are now fully sold out, and we're actually also already 60% booked for Q4. So the main question mark this year has actually been, "Are we going to avoid the seasonal lull that we typically get in Q4?" And at this stage, I think we have a reasonable chance of avoiding that with being so much booked already.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Great. And then were -- was seismic, in the second quarter internationally, was it additive to margins, to overall international margins in Q2?
Paal Kibsgaard: We don't really give details of this, right? So I would just say that the -- there was a good progression of seismic performance between Q1 and Q2. But in terms of specifics on margin and percentages, we don't disclose that.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: But that should continue in the third quarter, especially with a strong North Sea season and also beginning to get traction on your P&L with regard to pricing. I mean, is that fair?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think that's fair, yes.
Operator: We now have a question from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Paal, I'd like to ask a different question about the seismic business. Is -- how far out can you see now for tightness in marine seismic supply, demand? What is this meaning to pricing currently? And then -- so the last piece of that is, what are your plans in terms of adding new marine vessel capacity to the market?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. Well, if you look at our visibility in terms of bookings, beyond Q4 we don't really have any clear visibility on how the quarters are going to shape up. But I would say this year looks strong. If you look at the total market of high-capacity vessels today, total market is around 62, out of which WesternGeco has 16. So we are seeing that there is overall new-build from several of the players, of which we have 2 new-build vessels coming online in 2014. So our view on new-builds is twofold. We will add capacity if we can get the needed utilization. But we also have a vessel replacement program, which is basically retiring some of our older vessels and replacing them by new higher capacity ones, right? So depending on where we are in 2014, when the these new vessels are becoming available, we will make a call on actually whether we extend the life of the ones that we have or we actually retire them and maintain capacity flat. So it's all about ensuring utilization in marine seismic. And beyond that, we obviously want to make sure that we capture some of the upside of activity, if that was to materialize. But at this stage, I would say that we have a positive view on this year, and provided that there's no dramatic change to the overall market, that should spill into 2013 as well, most likely.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: How is pricing on new contracts, Paal, for -- that you've been able to sign for start-up in Q3 and Q4?
Paal Kibsgaard: Pricing is similar to what I said in the Q1 call. We are bidding more or less 10% up year-on-year. You will still find in Q3 that you'll have a mix of contracts bid last year and contracts bid this year, right? So you won't have that full 10% impact on the P&L, but overall again positive sentiments on seismic.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just my follow-up question, Paal, is you and particularly others have mentioned the price competitiveness of the deepwater LWD and Wireline markets. And, I mean, it's ironic to me, in a way, that the segment offering the highest technology should be among the most price competitive parts of the market. Can you see this changing over the second half of the year with even more new rigs starting up? Or do you think that this, I don't know, could be the new norm for the couple years, that this segment is just going to be highly price competitive because, maybe, of the desire of some of your competitors to maintain/increase market share?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I wouldn't generalize competitive pricing in the overall deepwater market. If you look at our position in the deepwater market, whether it's for Drilling & Measurements or Wireline, this is where we have the highest pricing and the highest margins of these type of businesses. So in some of the large contracts revolving around this, there might be quite competitive bidding. But overall, our deepwater business for both of these segments is highly accretive to our margins.
Operator: We now have a question from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Paal, I just want to circle back again on the -- to see if you could put some context around the small contracts comment internationally, and maybe just, for us, what that means for Schlumberger as we think about these contracts kind of as a percentage of your revenue internationally, because I think the market really focuses a lot on the large competitive bid tenders. But my understanding for you is that, really, that's a relatively small part of kind of the international global picture, if you will, in terms of from a revenue contribution. So I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about the smaller contracts and how that affects your revenue stream. And also just talk about, within this pricing comment, do the contracts, typically on these smaller contracts -- are they shorter term in nature internationally than what is typically believed as being 2, 3-year type contract terms in the international market in general, so you get quicker terms on these smaller contracts as we think about pricing escalation opportunities in future quarters?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if we start off with the first part of the question. The large contracts, as you say, or the ones that have been quoted in previous quarters, they make up, I would say, less than 20% of our overall contract volumes. So they are significant in terms of their size and duration, and they're often very strategic to secure. But as an overall part of the volume, it is not that big, so -- which means that it's the smaller contracts that make up more of a significant part of our international portfolio. The duration of these contracts vary a fair bit. It could be one well; it could be one project. So it's a bit difficult to quantify exactly what the average here is, right? But generally, they will be multiyear, typically, unless you're just bidding for one particular exploration well.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And I guess maybe this question is for Simon, just is a question on Geco. It's been for several quarters since you all have broken out what the revenue contribution is in absolute terms from Geco. I think the last time you guys were reporting on a quarterly basis, it was running on an annual basis somewhere in that $2-billion to $2.5-billion range. I mean, still given just the tailwinds in that business and the optimism around it, are you all able to size for us, Simon, where that revenue stream kind of stands right now for Schlumberger as a whole?
Simon Ayat: Well, you can assume that it is growing slightly. It is more or less what you mentioned, but the growth is reflective of the rest of the business, yes.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And you'd say it's probably growing at a higher rate -- a higher top line rate than maybe some of the other businesses.
Simon Ayat: It is higher than some of the other businesses, but overall, it's reflective of what we are experiencing with the Oilfield Services.
Operator: And we'll go next to Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: And, Paal, I wanted to follow up on your -- you've mentioned uncertainty a few times with respect to outlook, and yet when I think about the volume of business in the second half and even into early '13 that's offshore, you've got pretty long-term commitments in terms of operator commitments to the rigs. Can you, perhaps, clarify what you mean by uncertainty? Are you really speaking to black swan event, something like we saw in '08, or something more -- a more marginal degradation?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think it's all relative, right? I would just say that the -- in the event there is a significant event in the global economy, whether that is linked to China or Europe or it could be geopolitical, that could have an impact on -- even on shorter term activity, if cash flow comes into question. But I agree with you. In international markets, a significant part of the contract base is longer term and generally should be robust. But we saw significant volatility in the second quarter in terms of the global markets. And that volatility could bring some more caution into some of the -- some of how the operators, how they plan to go forward with activity. Now we have not seen any signs of change or any difference in plans versus what we had a quarter ago. But I think there is significant market uncertainties in the global market, and I think it's just prudent to point that out.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And the Excellence in Execution, help me delineate down 3 tracks in terms of what you're doing on internal processes with respect to procurement and supply chain management. There's also the focus on field efficiencies through the asset-light model and even selling and leasing queue as opposed to using your own crews. And then the technology route, like the highway or if we go back in time, something more like Platform Express, where I'm going with this is perhaps if you could maybe allocate what you think in terms of contribution by each of those 3 buckets and give us a sense as to whether this is really something that can continue over time, or whether it's something that's going to be quite lumpy and dramatic in one period and then stabilize and stair-step.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say all 3 elements, whether this is, like you say, technology -- I mean, technology has always been a key part of how we generate value and how we [indiscernible]. And the 2 other ones, which are more the shared services and supply chain part, as well as the field operation and utilization, the latter 2 has, I would say, still significant upside given the size of our global operations. So these multiyear programs I'm referring to, I believe they will be meaningful over time. But they're not going to have any dramatic quarter impact this quarter or next quarter or so forth, right? It's going to be part of a continuous improvement process where we put a lot more focus, and I would say scientific approaches, into some of the other parts of the company rather than just the technology that we develop and that we deploy for our customers. So there is significant upside in terms of how we run as a company for those internal aspects. And these are initiatives and programs that we are going to be carrying forward for the next 3, 4, 5 years, and they would have a gradual impact in terms of our results.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So it sounds pretty uniform across all 3, if I could sort of rephrase it. And the kind of trend that we've seen, which suggests 150 plus or minus basis points per annum, is reasonable to assume going forward.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I'm not going to give you any margin other [ph] than [indiscernible]. You knew that, didn't you? But I would say that we are continuously focused on driving our margins up, whether that is pricing, technology or these other efficiency programs.
Operator: We have a question from David Anderson with JPMorgan.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A question on Latin America. Paal, you guys seem to be in a really great position relative to your competitors down there. Just hoping you could help me understand a little bit more about the growth opportunities you see evolving over the next 12 to 24 months. I guess, there's 3 areas in particular -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's 3 main areas for you guys. First is production management contracts. You just announced another one starting up in Ecuador and the Mexico contract. Second would be Brazil, kind of how the pre-salt is evolving and all the contracts letting out. And the third would be Argentina. Obviously, what's going on with YPF and kind of the uncertainty around there. Could you just kind of address those 3 areas for us and how you see them evolving, please?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, sure. So I can take you quickly around the main countries there, right? So if you look at Mexico, I think Mexico has, so far this year, been one of the main drivers for Latin America for us. And going forward, we see further rig additions on land and shallow offshore in the second half of the year. Pemex is evaluating the Eagle Ford south extension as well and there are some both shale gas and shale oil pilots upcoming there, and we are engaged there with our shale workflow. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we also won the Panuco block, together with Petrofrac, in the second round of production incentive contracts. So overall, Mexico, with both the IPM activity, the individual products and services we do with Pemex, as well as these production incentive contracts, provides a very strong basis for growth and performance going forward. If we jump to Brazil, we see deepwater rig counts growing in the second half of the year. It's been relatively flat-ish in both Q1 and Q2, as a number of new rigs were arriving and being commissioned. So there's still, I would say, strong growth likely to take place in Brazil in the second part of the year. And a key, again, in Brazil is going to be linked to the outcome of these significant bids that are still under evaluation from Petrobras. In Argentina, we also maintain, I would say, a good activity outlook, driven by both the shale gas and shale oil, as well as on the conventional. There's some short-term uncertainty as the situation around YPF settles, but I would say that medium to longer term, our view on Argentina is still positive. And then the other one that we -- I think you referred to is Ecuador, where we are very pleased with how the start-up of the Shushufindi SPM project has progressed. And the activity in Ecuador, both on this project, Shushufindi, as well in the general market there, is going to continue to ramp up in the second half.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: If I could just go back to Brazil. Have you seen much of a change in how Petrobras is going about their business with a new CEO, Graças Foster, in place? I mean, is there a sense that pricing might be getting a little bit better? Is there a sense that maybe technology is going to be more of a focus? What are you seeing out of them, kind of late -- over the last 6 months or so?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I wouldn't say that there has been a significant change in how they go about doing their contracting. I would say that is generally because most of these bids have been in process throughout that period, right? So if there's going to be any change, I would expect that to maybe be in the next round of things, although they haven't really indicated anything. So I think the way they're going about their business in this bidding round is similar to what they've done in the past.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So really no change in pricing. Pricing still kind of challenged right now. You're hoping to get in there, show them -- show you can do the performance and hopefully the next round, you get better pricing. Is that the strategy?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we always, in any bid that we submit, we will bid it at the level that we can make the contract into a productive contract for Schlumberger and our shareholders. So there's a plan of how we can perform within the contract in terms of execution. And also, we have a very rich technology portfolio in terms of what we will introduce over the next coming years. And some of these Petrobras contracts could be off to, what, 6 to 8 years, right? So there's a significant new technology component of these contracts as well going forward.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And these bids, you're expecting to be awarded -- is it third quarter time frame for some of these bids?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, Petrobras hasn't really given us any timeline, so we will await when they announce.
Operator: We now have a question from Nigel Browne with Macquarie.
Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research: I just had one question, more product related. I wanted to know in terms of North America and internationally how impactful was your Artificial Lift and rotary steerable product line? And then, following on that, what is your estimation about the penetration of rotary steerable drilling systems in North America versus some of the more conventional techniques?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we don't really provide details of -- by segments. If you look at Artificial Lift, that is part of the Production Group. So really, the only detail I can refer you to is the Production Group results. And furthermore, we don't provide specific details around technologies as well, and rotary steerable being one of them. I would say, though, on rotary steerable in North America, our new PowerDrive Archer technology, which we have introduced recently, has been, I would say, tailor-made for the North America land market with the high build rate that it can provide. So I would say that the penetration of rotary steerable in the North America land market, at the back end of that technology, should go up from our side. But beyond that, I won't be able to provide you with any more details.
Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research: Okay. But even anecdotally, are you seeing any sort of leading indicators or queries around electric submersible pumps in North America at all?
Paal Kibsgaard: On land?
Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research: Yes, on land.
Paal Kibsgaard: On land, generally, there are other type of pumps employed in the North America land market, if you're referring to unconventional, not really ESPs.
Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research: Okay, so it's still a rodless market predominantly.
Paal Kibsgaard: Predominantly, yes.
Operator: We now have a question from Doug Becker with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Paul, you reiterated your expectation that international activity would grow in excess of 10%. If we take a look at the Baker Hughes rig count, it's implying a first half increase of around 5% year-over-year. Just trying to get a sense, is this consistent with a very aggressive ramp in the second half of the year? And is that Schlumberger's expectation? Or is there just a measurement difference in what you're looking at versus the Baker Hughes rig count?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think it might be a slight measurement difference. I think you'll see that the offshore rig rate will be, at least the way we see it, will be up more than what the land rig rate -- sorry, land rig count is, right? So you will have more growth in offshore versus land. And the impact of the offshore is, obviously, significantly higher to our -- both our revenue and our margins, right? So I think you need to break it down to offshore and land.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Makes sense. And since we have pretty good visibility into the offshore rigs, I mean, is there a potential that this significant ramp in the offshore rigs, we finally see the scales tipping in favor of the service companies for pricing power? Or is it because this growth is pretty well anticipated, still the slow grind higher?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, as I was referring to earlier, there is a tie between higher rig rates and more focus on operational excellence in the way our customers select their providers. So I would say that higher rig rates tied to utilization will potentially create more potential for us to raise prices and to get some of the value back for the strong performance that we deliver.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then switching to Europe, Africa, CIS. I just want to get some sense for the sustainability of revenue and margins there. A very strong quarter. I haven't heard anything that would suggest that we should see any type of pullback in the third quarter. I guess execution is always an issue. But is there anything that would suggest the second quarter revenue and margins aren't a good base to be thinking about going forward in Europe, Africa, CIS?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I would just say, with the exception of the overall macro caveat that I've referred to a couple of times, there is nothing exceptional in the results of ECA this quarter. So if the activity remains on track the way we have predicted it during the year, this should potentially continue in the second half of the year.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Are there still synergies associated with the Eurasia, I guess I'll call swap? Or have those largely been realized at this point?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, the overall integration of what we received versus what we sold is more or less done, so that part of synergies and the transaction is done. The other part of this is that this has given us access to significantly more land rigs in Western Siberia, to the point that we are extremely busy on land in Western Siberia, and we are actually struggling at this stage to have enough capacity to serve all the rigs. So there is still, I would say, performance upside surrounding the transaction we did with Eurasia as we continue to ramp up to cover all of their rigs.
Operator: We have a question from Robin Shoemaker with Citi.
Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I want to ask about the investment you made recently in Anton Oilfield Services as a strategy for China. But more broadly, in what countries or markets you think that having stake in a local service company is the route that -- one of the major routes that you'll use to grow in that market?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if I attack the second part of the question first. I think in the high-volume markets, the key high-volume markets around the world, there is often a benefit of owning or having interests in local companies, mainly because they know the local conditions, and in some cases they have technologies that are more custom made for the local environment, right? And we have some of these companies in North America. We got them with the Smith transaction. We have, over time, acquired a number of these types of companies in Russia. And we have now taken a stake in this company in China.
Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So let me just switch my other question back to North America. In terms of -- I think most of your fleets are -- your fracturing fleets are working in the term market as opposed to spot contracts. But is there a tendency over time for fewer term contracts to be signed, more fleets working in the spot market? And is there a level of pricing at which you would idle -- have -- prefer to have your fleets idle as opposed to working in -- at very low spot market rates?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, so today, we operate roughly around 80% in terms of term contracts. The remaining 20% will generally be fleets that are in between, I would say, in between work. So generally, at this stage, we'll be happy to go more or less to 100% term contracts the way it is set up. Is there a limit as to what pricing we would take on? I would say that we are not really in the business of taking on loss-making contracts. So that's where generally we would draw the line at this stage.
Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And do you have any idle fracturing fleets in North America now, or purposely or due to market conditions?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at what we've done in North America, we have completed the repositioning of our fleet and we have stopped further CapEx additions. And what we have done in addition to that, we have parked the excess pumps that we have at this stage. And the reason why we have excess pumps, we're not running fewer crews than what we did 3 or 6 months ago. But with the continued transition of activity from the dry gas basins to the liquids, the number of horsepower needed on a liquids job is significantly lower than what you need on a dry gas job. And that's why you -- while you run the same number of crews, you will have actually excess horsepower. And that's really what's driving the oversupply in the markets. So we have parked those pumps because we have no need for them.
Operator: And our final question will come from Michael Urban with Deutsche Bank.
Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: On the international side, good rundown of a lot of the markets, and it seems like most international markets are strong, if not accelerating. Are there any markets out there that are still weak or underperforming or maybe not where you'd like them to be?
Paal Kibsgaard: In the international market?
Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard: No, not really, nothing that stands out. I think we have -- we see good performance versus the overall plan that we put in for this year throughout, more or less. So no, there's nothing that really stands out.
Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And then finally on Russia, specifically, you've highlighted it as a very good market for you, and it seems like you're continuing to invest in the market. Are you -- is that more a function of just the higher volumes and the higher activity levels you're seeing? Or are you beginning to see better technology uptake there? I kind of think of Russia as maybe a little bit more volume driven, lower technology, perhaps with exception of things like Sakhalin.
Paal Kibsgaard: I think, historically, you're right. And largely in the Western Siberia land market, it is relatively low technology or local technology still today. But there is -- I would say there is a continued drive to upgrade some of these land rigs to higher capacity. And this provides a lot more opportunity to deploy more high-end technology, right, so -- which for instance, the transaction with Eurasia, where we have significantly opened up the rig footprint that we have available to us, as the technology needs grows on these rigs that they over time get upgraded, that is again a significant opportunity for us to drive [indiscernible] deployment on the, I would say, the basic footprint of Russian technology that we have acquired over the past decade.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Keeley. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call from Paris today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.  However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.98. This is a decrease of $0.13 sequentially and an increase of $0.27 compared to the same quarter last year.  Oilfield Services first quarter revenue of $9.9 billion decreased 4% sequentially. This decrease is largely attributable to the effect of the traditional year-end surge in product, software and multiclient sales that we experienced in the Q4, as well as the previously announced lower reutilization and downward pricing trend in our North America hydraulic fracturing business.  Oilfield Services pretax income of $1.9 billion decreased 10.4% sequentially while pretax operating margins declined 147 basis points. Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows: First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion decreased 7% sequentially, and margin declined 189 basis points to 26%. These decreases were due to the seasonally strong WesternGeco market client sales, robust year -- end of year SIS software sales that we experienced in the Q4.  Drilling Group first quarter revenue of $3.8 billion was flat sequentially, while margins improved 28 basis points to 17.4%. First quarter Production Group revenue of $3.5 billion decreased 4.4% sequentially, while pretax margin fell 338 basis points to 17.6%. These decreases were primarily attributable to the pricing pressure, lower utilization and cost inflation in Well Services North America, as well as the effect of the seasonally strong completion and Artificial Lift Q4 product sales.  From a geographic perspective, North America margins declined 409 basis points to 22.8%, while international margins were essentially flat at 19.1%, despite the significant impact of the Q4 product and software sales and the seasonal drop in activity in Russia, China and the North Sea during Q1.  The Distribution segment contributed $713 million in revenue and $35 million in pretax operating income. Last week, we announced that we reached an agreement to sell Wilson. We will, therefore, report our entire Distribution segment as a discontinued operation in the second quarter.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.8% in the first quarter, consistent with the previous quarter. We still expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2012 to be in the mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographical mix of earnings. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.8 billion as compared to $4.85 billion at the end of Q4, representing a $951 million increase, resulting from the seasonal deterioration in working capital we typically see during Q1.  Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $961 million of CapEx and $324 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.38 million shares at an average price of $74. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011. And now I turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Our first quarter results showed good progress as we continued our strong focus on execution and operational excellence. In terms of activity, we saw growth in exploration and deepwater markets in line with our outlook for the year, while we experienced the normal seasonal slowdown in multiclient and product sales, as well as in activity levels in some areas of the northern hemisphere.  In North America, we executed well in all parts of the business during the quarter. Sequential revenue was down 3.5%, and margins were down 409 basis points, driven by lower multiclient sales and the dynamics in the hydraulic fracturing market. We have, over the past 2 quarters, signaled that hydraulic fracturing pricing is starting to come under pressure. And during the first quarter, the downwards pricing trend seen in the gas basins also reached the liquids-rich basins. So far, the pricing impact varies by basin as excess capacity is moved around, but we expect to see lower pricing reaching all basins in the coming quarters. In addition, the continued movement of rigs and frac capacity adds costs and lowers utilization, which together with the pricing impact, puts pressure on margins.  Elsewhere in North America land, our wireline logging, coiled tubing and some drilling product lines saw revenue growth, while pricing remained flat to slightly up. In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity grew in line with our outlook for the year and was further supported by a number of new drilling permits granted during the quarter. Our deepwater market share and operational performance remains very strong and are reflected in our operating margins, which are now back to pre-moratorium levels.  In the international markets, revenue was down 4% sequentially due to lower product sales and the seasonal slowdown in Russia, China and the North Sea. At the same time, sequential margins were essentially flat, driven by very strong execution in all areas. During the quarter, international activity progressed in line with our outlook for the year, driven by the deepwater and exploration markets, in particular in East and West Africa and also by strong land activity in the Middle East and North Africa.  In terms of pricing, bidding remained competitive on large tenders for standard technology. However, we see pricing sentiments are starting to move upwards, as most of the large international contracts have now been rebid and our service capacity is getting tighter. Before discussing the quarter's results by area, I have a few comments on Marine seismic where vessel utilization was strong during the first quarter. At this stage, we are already fully booked for Q2, while Q3 capacity is filling up quickly, driven by higher activity in West Africa, the North Sea, the Arctic regions and Brazil. While some of the upcoming work was bid last year, current bid pricing is up around 10%, and we expect pricing to continue to go up as the year progresses. The WesternGeco backlog increased by 16% during the quarter.  In the Middle East and Asia, revenue was down by 4% sequentially, while margins were down 40 basis points. During the quarter, we saw strong activity growth in both Saudi Arabia and Oman, and this trend is set to continue for both countries in the coming quarters. In Iraq, the steep growth trends took a pause in the first quarter, as a number of our customers postponed awards and startups of new contracts, due to uncertainties around the security situation and infrastructure capacity. Towards the end of the quarter, sentiments were again turning positive. And following award of the outstanding bids in the second quarter, we expect to see strong growth in the second half of the year.  In Latin America, revenue was down 4% sequentially, while margins were up by 182 basis points. In Mexico, offshore activity continued to grow during the quarter, and we also saw a moderate increase in IPM activity on land. We are currently mobilizing for the Carrizo production incentive contract, with operation scheduled to start around midyear. In Brazil, the deepwater rig count remained flat during the quarter, while we saw solid activity in our IPM projects. There continues to be active bidding for Petrobras with award of the main outstanding contracts likely taking place over the next quarters. In Ecuador, we signed a production incentive contract for the Shushufindi field during the quarter, with planned start-up around midyear.  In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue decreased by 3% sequentially while margins were down by 109 basis points. During the quarter, we saw strong growth in activity in Nigeria, Angola and East Africa, driven by both deepwater exploration and the major development projects. And the activity outlook for seismic and rig-related services in this region remains very positive. In Russia and the North Sea, we experienced a normal seasonal slowdown due to winter weather, but both markets are on track for solid activity growth for the year. In Libya, activity continued to grow during the quarter, and we're also back to profitability in March. Activity will continue to ramp up during the year, as additional rigs become available and is set to reach pre-conflict levels in early 2013.  Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights. The Reservoir Characterization group saw continuing strength in exploration and deepwater activity during the quarter, as witnessed by the number of high-technology logging and Testing Services deployed in projects around the world. In addition, we previewed our new generation seismic streamer during the quarter, which uses a novel 4-component sensor to measure the reflected wave in much more detail, including its direction. This is a major step forward for marine seismic, similar to the medical industry moving from a 2D x-ray to a full 3D CAT scan, and it will further widen our technology lead in Marine seismic.  In land seismic, we continue to deploy our new, unique technology, which offers a step change in land seismic imaging quality. In addition to operating UniQ on our own land seismic crews, WesternGeco recently created a new division to sell and lease the UniQ technology to other service companies, as well as to energy companies who maintain their own crews. The decision to sell and lease the UniQ technology will open up an additional $1.3 billion market for our WesternGeco product line.  In the Drilling Group, new technologies introduced during the quarter included the MicroScope high resolution resistivity and imaging service, which will further support our customers in estimating reserves, placing horizontal wells and optimizing completion design. In addition, the Pathfinder iPZIG at-bit inclination and imaging service helps optimize well placement in target zones and is developed for unconventional oil and gas markets. The iPZIG service has already been successfully field tested in coalbed methane, heavy oil and shale plays in North America and Australia.  In the Production Group, HiWAY activity continued to grow rapidly with operations conducted for more than 45 clients during the quarter and with a number of fracturing stages growing by more than 25% sequentially. In addition to deploying HiWAY through our traditional business model, we also introduced the Spark [ph] business model in the past quarter to expand the market uptake of HiWAY. Here, we provide HiWAY job engineering and monitoring, proponent chemicals, as well as blending services, while the hydraulic horsepower, which often makes up 2/3 of the well-side CapEx, is provided by a third party. To date, we have pumped around 70 HiWAY stages in North America with the Spark [ph] model, and we will start conducting jobs in key international markets in the coming quarters.  Also during the quarter, Framo Engineering was awarded the Gullfaks subsea wet gas compression project for Statoil. This represents the first subsea project of this nature in the world and builds on the unique technology position of Framo Engineering.  Let's now turn to the outlook where the main risk of a global double-dip recession appears to be behind us, although there are still uncertainties linked to the global financial markets and potential geopolitical events. In terms of oil demand, the 2012 outlook has also stabilized after a series of downward revisions in recent quarters. Based on the weakness of non-OPEC supply, OPEC spare capacity being at the 3-year low and supply risks from a number of sources, we do not expect oil prices to weaken significantly in the coming quarters. In the U.S., the production growth from unconventional gas, coupled with very mild winter weather, has driven storage to record levels. This has sent natural gas prices to a 10-year low and has led to a subsequent drop in gas activity, which is unlikely to recover in the near term.  In the international markets, natural gas and LNG prices remain solid and, based on the demand outlook, are unlikely to weaken significantly in the near term. In terms of our activity outlook for the year, we maintain our positive view on the international markets with rig count growth north of 10%, driven by the exploration and deepwater markets, as well as key land markets. With our strong focus in execution, a very solid contract base and a rich new technology portfolio, we are well prepared to capitalize on these trends.  In North America, the transition from gas to liquids-based activity will continue in the coming quarter, and the outlook for dry gas drilling activity remains uncertain. We still expect U.S. land rig activity to be in line with Q4 2011 levels provided the ongoing drop in gas rig activity continues to be offset by increasing activity in the liquids-rich basins. The other main uncertainty in North America is the evolution of pressure pumping pricing, which based on the ongoing transition, is set to continue down in the coming quarter. Still, our well-balanced service portfolio on land and our strong leverage towards the Gulf of Mexico puts us in a good position to outperform in the North America market going forward.  Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Paal. We’ll now open the call for questions. Keeley?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of James West at Barclays.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Paal, I thought the change in your prepared commentary about international pricing was interesting, especially since you highlighted sentiments. Is this sentiment changes from your competitors who are now out of capacity and need to raise pricing? Or is it your customers who are pushing back less on price increases as technology and expertise becomes more important with rig rates moving up as quickly as they are? Or is it a combination of both?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think it's a combination of both, James. So if you want my perspective, bidding is always very competitive, whether we are at the peak or the trough of the cycle. Now the key to pricing trends is the sentiment, which is again driven by the view of activity outlook. And if you look at the activity outlook going back a couple of years, it's been under a constant cloud of uncertainty, whether it's natural disasters, geopolitics or the global economy, right? So even though there has not been too much overcapacity or a lot of overcapacity, there's still been a constant negative pricing sentiment. Now I think the industry is starting to realize, and we are certainly starting to realize, that in spite of the ongoing macro uncertainties, the tight supply and demand fundamentals gives a very solid basis for activity growth as we have seen consistently in 2010, 2011 and also now in 2012. So when you couple this fact with stabilizing GDP growth and also oil demand outlook, as well as tight service capacity in the industry, it really creates that positive pricing sentiments that I'm referring to.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. That's extremely helpful. And one of the offshore drillers mentioned yesterday there's been a big change in the last kind of 6 to 12 months around their customers' views of capacity. I assume that you're seeing that similar trend that your customers are now becoming -- I guess that sentiment would argue that the customers are becoming a little bit more concerned about the oil service industry's ability to provide the services they need for their programs.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I think that's fair. I think there are more concerns over capacity now. And like I said, there was never that much overcapacity. And I think whatever overcapacity was there, I think it’s dwindling quite fast. We are actually quite tight in several of our product lines already. And I think it's also worthwhile to note is that over the past 2 years, most of the major international contracts have now been rebid. So there is now an opportunity to start raising prices on the smaller upcoming contracts, which we are in the process of doing, right? And then if you look at what's happening in rigs and seismic, typically there, the contract size is smaller. And that's why you can see them move quicker in terms of testing prices. With big multisegment, multiyear and multi-rig contracts like some of the big ones we are -- we have been bidding on over the past 2 years, you really don't want to be shut out. And I think that's where pricing on the large contracts has been very competitive and with that kind of slightly negative pricing sentiment. But I think most of those contracts are now either bid or even awarded, and there is now an opportunity to start raising prices on the smaller upcoming contracts without any significant risk.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of David Anderson of JPMorgan.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I thought it was very interesting in your release that you noted a number of reservoir enhancement projects, highlighting ESPs and Framo, a number of projects, and then again on the production management contract in Ecuador. Now investors typically associate Schlumberger with exploration, but you seem to really be gaining ground on the other end of the production curve. I was just wondering if you could help us understand how big a part of this business -- of this is your business now. And is this something we could potentially double over the next couple of years, considering all the mature production coming out of the IOCs?
Paal Kibsgaard: You're referring to these production incentive contracts, specifically?
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes. But also to talk -- a lot of talk about Framo in there.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That's obviously a different kind of part of your business that we don't -- that seems to be getting highlighted more these days.
Paal Kibsgaard: No. That's a fair question. So if I just take one step back. We have, for a long, long time, been very, very strong when it comes to Reservoir Characterization. And with these transactions we've done over the past couple of years, we’ve also built a very similar position of strength in drilling. And our focus now from a portfolio standpoint in terms of further building portfolio is very much focused on the production side. So you are quite perceptive in picking that up. When it comes to the production incentive contracts, we see this as quite a strong growth vehicle for us going forward. This is why we created a separate product line focusing entirely on this. This part of our business was previously managed then under IPM and basically was a subset of IPM. So today it is not a significant part of our business, but it's probably one of the fastest-growing parts of our business. It is a new business model where some of the award -- some of the contracts are awarded, but quite a few of them are actually just negotiated straight without bidding in many cases. So it is one of the areas where we, as a company, can get the highest multiple on our services due to our strength in characterization, due to our strength in drilling and also due to our strength, which is now becoming even stronger, in production, right. So if that business can double over the next 3, 4 years, it can. It is still a relatively small part, but I would say it's one of the fastest-growing parts of our business.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. As a follow-up, I guess it's not quite related. But I just want to ask you about Argentina. Obviously, everybody's got a lot of questions down there in Argentina. You guys have staked out a big position down there. I think you've talked about doing 80% of frac stages. Can you just help us kind of walk through kind of some of the political risk and how you guys are navigating that? Does this -- what's happened in recent days, how does this change kind of your philosophy in terms of that market? Does it change your views on putting capital on the market? How are you thinking about this kind of new risk paradigm, I guess?
Paal Kibsgaard: It's a fair question. So we have moved a fair bit of capacity into Argentina over the past 12 months, which actually I'm quite happy that we've done, because if you try to move capacity into the country now, you might be spending 12 months in customs or whatever. And so I think the key now is that we have a very strong position there. We haven't really changed our view on the potential or the resource base. That's absolutely there. Now with the government repealing the Oil Plus program [Oil and Refining Plus program] and also making import and export somewhat more challenging, there is some more short-term uncertainty. But we are still quite positive on the medium to long term of Argentina. And I think whatever way they are going to develop these resources, and they will, there's going to be a strong need for our expertise and for our products and services there. So I think at this stage, we continue to operate as we have been doing, but we have observed some of these political changes, right. But as of today, it hasn't really impacted our business.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: In other words, the work is still there. It's just you're going to be working for a different operator, essentially.
Paal Kibsgaard: Potentially, yes.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Kurt Hallead at RBC.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Paal, my question is going to be focused -- I'll get it off the table here on North America and your outlook for the remainder of the year. And if you can maybe parse that between -- I know you mentioned pricing pressures in the frac market. Can you give us some color on what's going on in some of the other product and service lines? And can you also just help us understand maybe the margin progression in North America as it relates to, if you will, the frac and service components? Contrast that to Gulf of Mexico and contrast that to seismic. That would be very helpful.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. I'll have a go at that. So I think -- if we start off with North America land, the way I see it, we are facing 2 main uncertainties going forward, right. So the first one is the outlook for gas rig activity. Now with the record storage levels and natural gas pricing below $2, the drop in gas rig activities have to continue down from the current levels in the low 600. How low it's going to go? It is unclear at this stage. As the activity flow are supported by the lease commitment drilling in Paris [ph], is actually not that significant. Now on the other hand, the other main uncertainty is pressure pumping margins, which are under attack from several fronts. Firstly, utilization is likely to remain challenged because the lower well inventory leaves the frac fleets chasing the rigs much, much more than what we used to do 6 or 12 months ago. If you look at the bid pricing, it continued to drop in both gas and liquids during the quarter. On average, towards the end of the quarter in gas, we were bidding about 20% down sequentially and, in liquids, about 10% down sequentially on average between the liquids basins. Now in the first quarter, the new pricing started to significantly impact margins in the gas basins and in some of the liquids basins, while the rest of the liquids basins I see being impacted of the new pricing in the coming quarters. Now there's another key thing to realize as well, and that is that in the liquids, there are more stages per well. But the horsepower required per stage is actually much lower because we pump at lower pressures and lower rates. So while you need the fleet in liquids, you actually need fewer pumps or less horsepower -- or actually fewer pumps per fleet and less horsepower per fleet in the liquids, which again is going to contribute to the oversupply of horsepower. So if you add to these factors the fact that there is significant horsepower and order for the industry, we believe there is considerable uncertainty around the outlook for pressure pumping pricing and the margin. So the fact that it's coming down in Q2 I think is a given. And I think there's also significant uncertainty around H2, and it might come down further in H2. Now if you look at our side, we obviously are in the pressure pumping business, but we have the least exposure to this business if you compare us to our main competitors. And some of the other mitigating factors that we have done is that we have HiWAY within pressure pumping, and the off-take of HiWAY is going very well. We had another 25% sequential growth in the number of stages during the quarter. And we also introduced the Spark [ph] business model, which is then focused on the blending or lower pressure part of frac-ing. And obviously, as I said, we have significantly higher leverage towards wireline, logging and coiled tubing and drilling of land and also towards the Gulf. So I think, overall, there are issues around pressure pumping ,which is going to have an impact on the business, but we are quite well-leveraged towards other things which should give us an advantage going forward.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Very helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up to that and sticking just to the North America at this juncture, would you expect that when you take seismic in your Gulf of Mexico and what's going on with the frac market, when you roll that all together, margins coming down in aggregate for North America in the second quarter, do you expect the low point for margins potentially to be second, third quarter? Or do you think that given the negative momentum in the frac market, it’s just going to drag margins down throughout the course of the year? What would be your best guess right now?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think, like I said, what is clear is that Q2 is coming down. And that's due to the fact that the -- there'll be more impact on the pressure pumping pricing and also we have the Canada breakup. Now what is going to happen in the second half of the year? I think that pressure pumping margins are going to continue to be under further pressure. Now to what extent we can offset this from seismic, from deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and from the other part of our land offering, which actually is holding up well in activity and actually holding up very well in margins, obviously, we have the ambition of trying to offset as much as possible of this. And now whether we're going to be able to do that is going to be a function of how severe the pressure pumping pricing and margin decline is going to be. And at this stage, I simply don't know.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Scott Gruber at Bernstein.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I want to inquire about the impact of contract role internationally. Paal, you mentioned that the majority of the large contracts have been repriced. But are all of these contracts in force today, such that the negative role has passed assuming probably static pricing on future contracts?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I mean, there are still some contracts that are being evaluated and are going to be awarded. And I think the main of these are centered around Brazil and Petrobras. But I would say the majority of the large international contracts have been awarded, and they are already in effect, right. So most of the pricing concessions that have been given in the large contracts, I would say, are in our operations today.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then can you provide some color on the revenue split internationally between these long-term contracts, whether it's for bundled or discrete services, the full IPM contracts and the shorter-cycle work? What's the broad split between those 3 buckets?
Paal Kibsgaard: It's very difficult to give a number. But I would say that the large multisegment, multi-rig, even multiclient type of contract is, I mean, is centered in the certain parts of the world. You have -- obviously, you have Brazil. You have part of it in the Far East around the Pan-Malaysian contract, and you have some of them around the North Sea, right. So it is -- they are significant contracts for the markets that I was referring to, but it is only a part of our international operation, right. So we have -- there's a lot of other contracts. And if you look at the volume of work we have, for instance, for other NOCs and for independents and even other IOCs, that's still quite significant. So I can't give you a number. We put a lot of focus on it in our commentary because they are key kind of battlegrounds for pricing, but they’re only a subset of our total contract portfolio internationally.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. But it's fair to say that given that there's few awards coming out this year -- I think there's only 2 big tenders to be signed -- the shorter cycle work, the seismic activity, they're going to be a much more significant drivers in '12 versus repricing on big tenders?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think that's fair to say, yes.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Bill Sanchez at Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Paal, I see that you all are keeping your CapEx guidance flat at $4.5 billion for the full year. You've outlined here I think a modest bump in terms of your international rig count growth expectation for the year, and I know you're keeping a close eye in terms of North America pressure pumping capacity additions. Where do we stand right now in terms of maybe -- have we already seen the reallocation of capital from the North America markets to the international markets to start funding those opportunities you have there more fully? Or is that something we could still expect going forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, first of all, Bill, there is no change to the rig count outlook for international. So I believe we said it's north of 10% in Q4, and we're saying north of 10% at this stage. So really no change to the activity outlook. International is coming in basically exactly the way we were foreseeing it, right. But when it comes to our CapEx, yes, we are upholding the $4.5 billion outlook. So in the Q4 call, what I said was that the budget or the plan was $4.5 billion, but we would look at the year in 2 halves. So in the first half, we would invest at 2011 levels, which is around $1 billion per quarter and then potentially ramp up of another 20% to 25% in H2 based on how things were going and also based on our view in 2013, right. So if you look at where we stand at the end of Q1, Q1 was at the planned rate of around $1 billion, and Q2 is going to be quite similar. The main change was that we halted the NAM pressure pumping additions, and we redirected this pressure pumping capacity or CapEx to the international markets, giving them their pressure pumping capacity earlier in the year. Now for the rest of the year, we're going to make a call on H2. Whether we actually go for this 25% ramp or not, we will make that call during the coming quarter. If I was going to do a preview, I would say that the NAM pressure pumping CapEx will likely be lower than planned. And any CapEx additions in North America for pressure pumping is likely to be more focused on the low-pressure blending part rather than on pumps, based on what I was referring to in my North American comments. While internationally, I think you could see a ramp further from the spending level now in H2, but within the envelope that we've already given.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And if you do go ahead and make the adjustments on the pressure pumping side in North America, Paal, would that be outright cancellations of capacity? Or would you just shift that in -- those deliveries into 2013?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we’re already cutting in North America for pressure pumping, right. So we will see how much international wants to pick up from that. And the balance we will then either work with our suppliers. We'll see what we will potentially keep in inventory and basically manage that. But we have a very good dialogue and setup with our suppliers there. And I'm very convinced that we can manage that in a good way.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: One follow-up for you. As we look at certainly very good performance in margins in the first quarter, and everything I think you've outlined from a pricing and activity standpoint suggests margins just continue to improve here. I'm just curious of your thoughts as we continue to see mobilization of people and tools for you into these incremental opportunities in the deepwater contracts. Is there any expected margin drag you anticipate on your international businesses as a result?
Paal Kibsgaard: No. I mean, there's always additional costs when you mobilize and start up new projects. But I mean, this is an ongoing business expense, and we have these type of costs on an ongoing basis, right? So we are focused on delivering steady international margin growth throughout 2012, right. And the starting point of this is really our focus on very strong execution. And I'm very pleased with what each part of the business has done so far this year in terms of very good cost and resource management. I'm also very pleased with the program that Smith and M-I is having, in particular internationally. They're doing very well both in terms of growth and in terms of margins. And then we have a very strong portfolio of new technology that we're introducing as well, right. So I think, overall, there are always added costs when you start up new projects, but this is part of ongoing business expenses and not something that should really impact our results.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert at Simmons & Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Continuing with the margin question internationally here. I mean, clearly, first quarter margins, at least for most of us, were better than expected. Flat quarter-on-quarter given the extreme seasonality in Northern Europe and Eurasia was impressive. Starting from a higher base than you did last year, for sure, but with regard to the road map for international margins over the course of 2012, you said steady improvement. Does that sort of convey the same order of magnitude of improvement that we witnessed last year Q1 to Q4? Or do you expect better than that?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don't even remember what the -- what's really...
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: You were up 250 basis points from Q1 to Q4 of last year. You went from 16 to 19-and-change. You’re starting at 19.
Simon Ayat: I'm sure you know that I'm probably not going to give you a number, right. But I would just go back to say that there is opportunity within how we execute with getting at least slight pricing -- I would say slight -- effective pricing traction maybe in the second half of the year for more of the activity mix, as well as from the sell-up of new or high-tech technology. So we have margin expansion potential during this year. Whether it's going to be 250 basis points or not, I'm not going to give you a number on that, other than we are working very hard, both through how we execute and also how we position ourselves for the new and upcoming contracts to drive margins up.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Two questions on seismic for you. Very positive commentary with regard to the outlook for pricing. On your bidding, you're up 10%. Do we actually start to get pull-through from that pricing improvement on your P&L second half of this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. So what you have is for our upcoming work in Q2 and Q3, some of the work was bid last season, which is obviously on last season's pricing, right. But there is a part which is bid now. And more of that in Q3 than Q2, which is going to be at that higher pricing and then will have the pull-through that you're looking for.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Okay. And then last question on multiclient. Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale coming up here this summer. Did we see the benefit of that in the fourth quarter? Or do we expect to see the benefit of that in the second quarter predominantly?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, so first of all, we did not see it in the first quarter. I think we saw some of it in the fourth quarter. I think there is still some uncertainty around how much of a boost we're going to have in Q2 because the IOCs and the large players, many of them have already purchased data either to pre-commit to the service that we've done over the past 18 months and also from late sales that they did back in Q4. So in order for it to be significant in Q2, I think we need a lot more interest and activity or participation from the independents, which we so far haven't seen yet.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael LaMotte at Guggenheim.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Paal, I'm really kind of intrigued by the Spark [ph] model. And in particular, if I think about the contrast of bundling as a means of trying to create value, you’re essentially dislocating the most commoditized and the horsepower. I'm wondering what -- 2 things, one, what that means for your margins kind of unlocking the big capital component, and two, sort of how far you think this model can go. Could we ultimately see horsepower in your view sort of going the way of even a rig market, being completely disassociated?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think it's a bit early to stretch it out that far now, right. I think we -- first of all, margin-wise for the Spark [ph] model, these margins are accretive to our pressure pumping business, and it’s also quite attractive from a return on assets or return on capital standpoint, right. And that makes it quite interesting. Part of the reason for doing this is that we have seen a trend where some of our customers have started to vertically integrate on the pressure pumping side with quite limited ability to do any kind of sophisticated higher-end blending type and pumping more sophisticated fluid systems, right. So we, through HiWAY, have really the only significantly differentiated fluid system in the market at this stage. And that's why we see that as a very good fit with some of these more -- with some of these pressure pumping companies that are owned by our customers. So that's the starting point. How far it can go? I don't know. I think the main view I have or we have is that the pump itself is not a significant part of the pressure pumping operation. It's going to be much more the fluid or the engineered fluid system that is going to create -- that basically creates the conductivity downhole that drives the value proposition going forward, right. And I think this is why you see as soon as there is enough supply of pumps, the pricing goes down very, very quickly, right. So I think there is a chance to get a lot more sustainable pricing and performance in the pressure pumping business if your business is more centered around what really generates the value, and that -- as far as we see it, that is much more the fluid system than the actual pump.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful. Totally unrelated follow-up, on the international gas side. Our view is that LNG prices are going to remain very strong for a very long time, which has obviously set off a scramble for exploitation of stranded gas, as well as redevelopment of more matured gas in places like Indonesia. I'm curious within the context of the 10% rig count growth, if you could give us a bit of a sneak peek into '13, what the bigger constraints are to seeing faster growth on the international gas front? Is it a rig constraint? Or is it at this point just about getting operators sort of focused on projects and queuing them up?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think it's a bit early for me to make a firm comment on that. We haven't looked at it in that much detail. But I would say that if it's conventional offshore, I think that there is no immediate, I think, shortcoming of rigs at this stage. I think it's more getting the projects lined up, right. But if you go more towards higher-end rigs, that might be constraint. But it's a bit early for me to comment on it in terms of 2013, I would say.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Maybe as a follow-up then, do you see more work coming from new basins such as a Mozambique or the sort of redevelopment of more mature provinces like Indonesia?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think we see both. I think the Far East with Indonesia, with Malaysia and Thailand is looking to be quite busy this year and going into next year. And obviously, there is significant focus on East Africa from an exploration standpoint. So I would say that both those regions and those type of developments in mature, more mature basins, as well as the newer basins are seeing good growth.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Paal, first question is in seismic. Given how pricing is improving and giving the contract outlook, do you think it's possible at this point for you to reach last cycle’s peak margins at WesternGeco in 2013?
Paal Kibsgaard: Again, I think it's too early to say. We are starting to see the signs of pricing traction, which we have been looking for, for the past 12 or 18 months, right. So capacity has tightened. If I look at the number of 3D vessels coming into the market scheduled for this year, which I think for the total market is only around 3, I don't see any issues with further capacity additions in terms of how it will impact pricing. So I think there are good chances of getting sustained pricing traction at least through this year, and then it's going to be a function of, I think, how much capacity is being added to the market, right. But the fact that margins are coming up is clear, but I think it's too early to say, yes, whether we’re going to see the peak margins of the previous cycle. And I think multiclient activity is also going to play into that equation.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And my follow-up, internationally, particularly offshore, it seems to me as if one of your big competitors wants to have a higher market share in LWD, particularly in deepwater, particularly offshore. And I would argue that your other competitor wants to have a higher market share in wireline. You're a company that measures market share very closely. With pricing coming up, do you think you’ve at least maintained your market share in both of those 2 businesses over the last year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I do. And I would say that international market share is really a function of the number of good contracts that you have, not the number of bad contracts. Also, international market is a function of how many contracts you retain and not necessarily how many contracts you win. So our contract portfolio today is very strong. There is significant upside potentially in terms of new technology, and this whole aspect of operational integrity and quality of service is still key market share drivers, right. And I've been quoting numbers about D&M replacement ratios in previous quarters. I think in Q4, this number was 31:5 that we replaced our competitors on rigs or wells or contracts, 31:5. And that number for Q1 is 30:3. So we continue to take work that our competitors might have previously won in terms of bidding, but they can't perform it, whether it's quality or capacity. And I think the other thing I would say is on -- that there is also an ongoing discussion about competitive pricing on deepwater and the margins we have there. I think the key -- if you want to look at how we have managed to maintain market share and maintain profitability, you need to look at our margin gap towards our closest competitor, which has expanded in the past year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Becker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: In the past, we've seen the share repurchase program characterized as aggressive and opportunistic. During the first quarter, it looks like the pace slowed considerably from what we saw last year. As we go through 2012, should we expect a less aggressive share repurchase program compared to 2011?
Paal Kibsgaard: Simon, you want to answer that?
Simon Ayat: Yes. Okay. Well, thanks for asking the question. We obviously slowed down the repurchase program in Q1. Now I want to take advantage of this question to highlight our strategy on how we consume our liquidity. So after dividend, the cash is used for -- our first priority for the cash is really the business needs, and this is CapEx, the working capital when we have expansion and the small acquisition. And any excess cash, we will spend it on buyback. Last year, we did expand, if you want, beyond the excess cash because of following the acquisition of Smith and the number of shares we issued in that transaction. So we decided to be more aggressive in the buyback. You're going to see it more in our traditional way, which is basically avoiding the increase in the number of share due to the stock-based compensation schemes that we have. So it will be slower, yes.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Makes sense. And then, Paal, recently, you announced an expansion of the core analysis capability in Houston. And I appreciate it's a pretty small part of the business, but can also generate very high returns. What role do you see core analysis playing in your business as you go forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, it's a key part of the Reservoir Characterization workflow, right. And we have, over the past 5, 6, 7 years, gotten further into that business. We have a great company up in Utah called TerraTek, which is leading in really high-end core analysis. And we've combined this with other parts of the company, as well as with our fluid analysis and some of the companies we bought there. And this is a key part of the characterization workflow. It is not a significant volume in terms of revenue, but like you say, it is higher-margin, and it's also a critical part of putting together that entire workflow and the entire, I would say, answer product to our customers.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Mike Urban of Deutsche.
Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Obviously, a lot of focus on the international pricing comments that you made. I wanted to take a little bit of different approach and talk about some of the other potential drivers of margin in the international business. In particular, I would think of things like mix of business as being a potential driver of margin and then also the volume. Now, you've talked about rig count, but are you also able to expand out of scope work and things like that as you grow into some of the infrastructure investments and some of the projects that are out there maturing? Just wondering if you can comment on those 2 items.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I think all those items that you're listing are key contributors to how we will drive margins, right, in addition to when we get pricing -- more pricing power. But the starting point for driving margins is very strong execution with respect to cost and resource management. We have a lot of focus within the company around leveraging our size and our footprint, even in a better way than what we have done in the past. We have a very strong international setup. And the way we run and conduct our business from a support standpoint from asset management, from maintenance and regional distribution of support activities, we have upside in terms of how that's run. And we are in the process of streamlining and upgrading how that's done. In other words, we will have a benefit to the bottom line, right. In addition to that, as I alluded to earlier, Smith and M-I is performing very well and continuing to improve margins under our international structure. We managed to lighten their support cost base. And also as they continue to grow, the flow through we can get on their business, even without pricing improvements, is actually quite good as well. And then like you say, the activity mix is favorable to us. Deepwater activity and exploration activity is highly accretive to our margins. And we also have a very strong portfolio in new technology. So I'm not going beyond what I said earlier in terms of how fast we can expand international margins, but we have potential to expand them, and we're working hard on getting that done.
Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful. And then in terms of some of the pricing improvements that you've talked about. Not so much on the large projects, which again, is still kind of competitive. But the shorter cycle stuff, smaller projects, how quickly will that flow through, just given some of the lead times that we typically see internationally? Is that something that could still materialize in 2012? Or is that a more material move next year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think you will have contracts where we will test pricing and likely win during this year. And we also -- when I refer to the wells or the projects or the contracts where we are replacing competition, we are obviously not replacing our competition on the same price as they bid at, right. So there will be some opportunities for smaller contracts with higher pricing. How quickly that's going to be material to the overall results, it's yet to be seen, right. But the fact that, that trend is starting, it will be a positive contribution.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Angie Sedita at UBS.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Paal, I mean, we discussed here with international pricing and a change of sentiment, one of your largest peers said that they are "pushing for pricing" on small to midsize projects. I mean, obviously, it's not only sentiment. It's what your competitors are doing. So are also seeing this in the marketplace? And if so, are you seeing this specifically in certain regions and product lines?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I wouldn't go into what regions we are seeing it. We are also testing pricing on smaller contracts. The main segments that we are seeing this in are the ones that are the tightest in capacity. Obviously, seismic, we already talked about. But then I would say wireline and drilling and measurements are the other ones where we are basically seeing this.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then given that North America is obviously flattening out and weakening and yourself and your peers are moving CapEx from the U.S. markets, the North American markets, abroad. Do you think there is -- or is there any risk that the international markets don't tighten further in 2013 if this CapEx moves abroad?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don't really think so. I think the main shift of capacity or CapEx would be around pressure pumping. And to what extent, I'm sure the other main or big integrated services companies is going to look at making sure that international operations get the right amount of pressure pumping capacity as well, right. Which over the past couple of years, at least we have been in many cases given priority to North America with [indiscernible]. So we are now getting back in and making sure we are properly set up in all the key basins where we need pressure pumping capacity. And I would say today, we are almost there. So in terms of how the international market is tightening, I don't think a shift from North America to international is going to be a significant problem because the activity level in North America is not really going down. The main issue you have is that there is oversupply of pumps.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: All right. Fair enough. And then finally, you also mentioned you are halting your capacity additions and pressure pumping here in 2012. What does that imply as far as when you'd stop seeing new capacity additions from Schlumberger? Is that Q3? Or is it still coming into Q4? Can you give us a little color there?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I can't give you the time because we will add back capacity when we can get utilization. I see really no point of adding capacity or pressure pumping capacity into the market now if I can't get the utilization, right. So it will be a function of when we can get that. And also, what I was saying is that the demand of pumps or horsepower in the liquids is going to be lower than what we had in the gas. So what we also can do is by investing and blending in low-pressure equipment, you can, in many cases, create more fleets out of the same horsepower in liquids than what you actually had in the gas, right. So our focus on CapEx in North America, if we need to add fleets, will be to add the low pressure part of a fleet and then basically use the existing horsepower first until we run out of that.
Operator: We have time for one more question. That will come from the line of Robin Shoemaker at Citi.
Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Paal, I wanted to ask you -- going back to international side, in terms of the specific regional markets that may be holding back some of your margin progress, I’d just like to highlight -- or ask you to highlight maybe a couple of those. I mean, I would start actually the first question with regard to Russia and how you see the evolution of that market, including potentially using higher-end technologies.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say -- first of all to your question about the overall margins. I would say that all parts of the business, I think, are doing a very good job in terms of how they execute and how they focus on both market share and margins in parallel. So that's the first point. But in Russia, specifically, we see very good growth in the Russian market for this year, in particular in Western Siberia. And just picking up on your point in terms of how higher-end technology can apply more there, I think what we're seeing in Russia is a continuous upgrade on the rig capability, more towards western standard and more towards higher-capacity rigs. And as you upgrade the rig base, the need for higher-end technologies that can drive efficiency will obviously and go up, right. So we are seeing a continuous, I would say, high-grading or upgrading of the rigs in Western Siberia. And with that, we will have a wider market for higher-end technologies. And what we have done over the past decade in Russia is that we have established a very solid footprint from the Russian companies that we have bought. And we have been continuing to use their locally made technology to have a deployment mechanism for higher-end technology when that becomes a requirement. So I would say that we are very well set up in terms of our footprint in Western Siberia, in particular through the Eurasia partnership and deal that we made last year. And with the continuous upgrade of the rig capabilities, the demand for higher-end technology is going to grow.
Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then in your earlier comments, you mentioned an improvement in sentiment in Iraq, right, just quite recently. And so is the profitability level in Iraq likely to rise through the year as we get more -- as more rigs go back to work?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say that our overall profitability in Iraq, I think, for the past 2, 3 quarters has not really been an issue, and we continue to see that's not an issue. So we had a pause in the growth rate, and that was more down to uncertainty around the security situation as the U.S. Army left towards the end of last year. And also some concerns around the rate of new infrastructure, in particular, offloading capacity in the Gulf for Iraq production. So those were the sentiments that I was referring to that was turning positive towards the end of the quarter. And there is a number of contracts to be awarded and also started up, which I think a lot of it is going to take place during the second quarter. And beyond that, we see very strong growth going forward, and also, we see profitability being quite reasonable for us there.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call are Andrew Gould, Chairman; Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared statements will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.11 per share. This is an increase of $0.13 sequentially and $0.26 compared to the same quarter last year. We recorded $0.06 of charges relating to asset write-offs in Libya and the continuing integration of Smith. During the quarter, we were able to physically assess the status of our assets in Libya. This assessment resulted in us recording a pretax and after-tax charge of $60 million relating to certain assets that are no longer recoverable as a result of the political unrest.  Pursuant to our integration plan, the Smith integration team, which has done an excellent job, will remain in place throughout 2012. As a result, we will continue to incur merger and integration charges during 2012 that we will continue to highlight separately.  Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue of $10.3 billion increased 8% sequentially. Of this $755 million sequential increase, approximately 20% of this growth came from the traditional year-end surge in product and software sales, and 19% came from the significant sequential increase in WesternGeco multiclient sales. Oilfield Services pretax income of $2.2 billion increased 12.3% sequentially, while pretax operating margins improved 82 basis points. Notably, revenue pretax income and margins all improved on a sequential basis across each of the 3 product groups and the 4 geographical areas.  Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by group -- by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.8 billion increased 12% sequentially, and margins improved 340 basis points to 27.9%. These increases were due to very strong WesternGeco multiclient sales, robust end-of-year SIS software sales and the strong exploration activity at Wireline.  Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $3.9 billion increased 6.3% sequentially, while margins remained essentially flat at 16.8%. Revenue growth was led by M-I SWACO with strong performances in North America and Latin America. IPM had a very strong quarter, particularly in Mexico and Iraq, while D&M posted strong results in U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Europe/CIS/Africa area.  Fourth quarter Reservoir production revenue of $3.6 billion increased 6.7% sequentially, while pretax margin improved 36 basis points to 21.3%. These increases were primarily attributable to the strong Completion and Artificial Lift product sales across all areas. Well Services revenue continued to grow as a result of capacity additions. The Distribution segment contributed $685 million of revenue and $26 million of pretax operating income.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.8% as compared to 23.7% in the third quarter. We expect the ETR for the full year 2012 to be in the mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographical mix of earnings.  Net debt at the end of the quarter was $4.85 billion as compared to $5.16 billion at the end of Q3, representing $314 million improvement. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.25 billion of CapEx, $636 million of stock repurchases and $242 million of pension and retiree medical contributions. CapEx is expected to approach $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011. Yesterday, our board of directors approved a 10% increase in our annual dividend to $1.10 per share. This follows last year's 19% increase and reflects our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. During the full year 2011, we repurchased 36.9 million shares at an average price of $81.15 for a total of $3 billion.  And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Our overall fourth quarter results showed solid sequential growth, driven by stronger activity for most of our service product lines and by stronger product sales for Completions, Artificial Lift, SIS and WesternGeco multiclient seismic.  In North America, we had a strong quarter with 6% sequential revenue growth and margins up 163 basis points. This was led by continued growth in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where market share momentum remained strong for our high-value technology offering and where operational performance was extremely solid. During the quarter, we moved a second wide-azimuth seismic fleet into the Gulf of Mexico, and we saw strong multiclient sales. In North America land, revenue grew in line with rig count, while margins increased moderately, driven in part by internal efficiencies and active cost management. Pricing in our Wireline and Drilling product lines continued to show an upward trend, although slowing somewhat compared to previous quarters. In pressure pumping, downwards pricing pressure in the gas basins continued in the fourth quarter, while pricing in the liquids and liquids-rich basins remained more or less flat, excluding the impact of continued conversion to 24-hour operations. In the international markets, revenue grew almost 9% sequentially, while margins were up by 91 basis points. Growth was driven by deepwater and exploration activity in East and West Africa and by strong land activity in the Middle East and North Africa. During the quarter, we secured a number of key contracts that further strengthens our international position. This includes a shale gas contract covering stimulation and project management for a pilot well campaign in the Middle East. We have already deployed a team of shale explorers to the country, and we have started to mobilize assets and prepare the project infrastructure.  In terms of pricing, bidding remained competitive on large tenders for standard technology while we saw positive pricing signs in selected smaller tenders in Wireline and Drilling & Measurements. Our pricing upside continues to be driven mainly by technology and operational performance.  In Marine seismic, we saw the predicted seasonal drop in vessel utilization during the quarter. However, utilization for the coming quarters is already looking strong, driven by higher activity in West Africa, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. WesternGeco backlog grew to $1 billion in the quarter.  In Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially, while margins were up 124 basis points, driven mainly by the land business in the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, the ramp-up of rigs progressed in line with plans during the quarter, and we saw strong growth in both rig-related and rigless activity. In Iraq, sequential growth was again solid, led by further startup of rigs and strong activity on both ongoing IPM projects and on individual product line contracts. Oman also showed very good sequential growth, driven by Artificial Lift and Wireline. In Latin America, revenue grew by 11% sequentially, while margins were up by 15 basis points. Sequential growth was led by Mexico, where offshore activity increased and where land activity on IPM projects was strong. During the quarter, we signed our first production incentive contract with Pemex, covering the Carrizo Field, with operations expected to start at the end of the second quarter. In Argentina, we have established a very strong position in the emerging shale plays. So far, we have conducted a large part of the shale fracturing jobs in the country. And during the quarter, we secured a number of new service contracts in this market. In Brazil, another 4 deepwater rigs were added during the quarter, with a total now standing at 64. There continues to be active bidding for Petrobras. And during the quarter, we were awarded the largest share of the new mud logging contract. On land, activity remained strong, driven by IPM projects for OGX and Petro. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew 8% sequentially, and margins were up 125 basis points. During the quarter, we saw strong growth in activity in Angola, Nigeria and East Africa, driven by both deepwater exploration and the major development projects. Based on the positive results on the first pre-salt exploration wells in Angola, we expect strong growth in West Africa going forward. In Russia, we saw solid offshore activity in Sakhalin, although this was partly offset by the start of the winter slowdown in Russia land. The integration of services from the Eurasia transaction is progressing well, and our preferred vendor agreement with Eurasia Drilling offers a strong growth platform in the active Western Siberia market. In Libya, activity restarted early in the quarter with the initial focus on Wireline, coiled tubing and Artificial Lift services. Our infrastructure, field assets and workforce are fully operational, and we expect to see steady activity growth over the coming year. Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights of the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, we completed the purchase of ThruBit during the quarter. ThruBit's technology offers a novel way of obtaining wireline logs in horizontal shale wells and is based on the deploying a slim tool through the drill pipe during the final wiper trip before starting the well completion. Today, more than 90% of the horizontal shale wells in North America are not logged due to the total cost of operations and the lack of a wellsite answer product that can guide operators in selecting the optimal completion intervals. Building on the ThruBit technology, we believe we can offer a cost-effective solution as an integral part of our shale reservoir characterization workflow to help open up this market. In the Drilling Group, the integration work continued to progress very well. Synergies with Smith in 2011 surpassed even our revised targets, and the transaction was again accretive on an earnings-per-share basis in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Within our operations, we continue our efforts to drive drilling performance to the next level. One area of focus is the streamlining of our drilling engineering workflows, supported by the creation of integrated drilling engineering centers in our field locations. In these centers, we co-locate the members from our technical drilling community, allowing them to jointly drive the planning, design and support of our drilling operations using real-time wellsite links. So far, we have established 10 of these centers worldwide, and we have plans to double this number in the coming year. In the Reservoir Production Group, HiWAY activity continued to expand with operations conducted for more than 35 clients during the quarter. The number of HiWAY fracturing stages grew by more than 50% sequentially. The expansion was particularly strong in North America, but international deployment also continued with operations, so far, conducted in 9 countries.  In well intervention, we continue to build our new technology offering both on land and offshore. ACTive coiled tubing technology, which provides real-time down-hole data during stimulation and intervention operations, gained further tractions, particularly in the Middle East. In addition, we have started deploying the new LIVE slickline platform, which offers real-time telemetry for mechanical and basic production services. The largest uptake of LIVE has so far been in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where the combined capability of mechanical and production services in one compact and light unit is being leveraged for plug-back and recompletion operations. Let's now turn to the outlook, where GDP growth for 2012 continued to be revised downwards during the fourth quarter and where positive signs from the U.S. and Japan were offset by continued concerns over the euro zone. In spite of the political efforts to resolve the issues, we expect the uncertainties surrounding the global financial markets to continue in the coming quarters. And although the chance of a global double-dip recession remains a possibility, we do not believe this to be the most likely scenario. In line with lower GDP growth, oil demand outlook was also revised downwards during the fourth quarter. However, the increasing rate of the emerging markets, the weakness in non-OPEC supply and a number of geopolitical concerns have supported oil prices. And absent a global recession, we do not expect prices to weaken significantly.  For natural gas, the continued increase in unconventional gas production, modest demand growth and mild weather at the beginning of the heating season contributed to very high storage levels and low natural gas prices in North America. In Asia, on the other hand, the need for alternative energy sources following the Fukushima incident, along with fast-growing demand in the non-OECD countries, is maintaining high prices and significantly increasing LNG demand. Looking at our industry, the general feedback from our customers and the findings from the recent spending surveys indicate that E&P investment in 2012 will be up, although the predicted levels vary. The surveys also suggest that exploration spending will continue to increase. Against this backdrop, we are planning for growth in 2012, although we are building significant flexibility into our plans given the uncertainties. In North America, we expect land rig count to remain flat with Q4 2011, provided the ongoing drop in gas activity will be counted by increasing activity in the liquids and liquids-rich basins. We anticipate a continued recovery in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico with strong demand for high-value technologies.  In the international markets, we expect 2012 rig count to be up around 10% versus 2011, driven by strong offshore activity in West Africa, the North Sea and Brazil, and by land activity in the Middle East, North Africa and Western Siberia. Overall, we remain confident that any potential reductions in activity will be short-lived due to limited spare oil capacity and to growing international demand for natural gas. Furthermore, the breadth of our technology offering, the strength of our international footprint and contract portfolio and the balance we have established between our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Services in the North America market would allow us to continue to grow. Growth in worldwide deepwater and exploration activity will also favor Schlumberger.  Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Paal. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Greg?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Crédit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I appreciate your outlook comments, as always, Paal, but given this dramatic falloff in natural gas prices in the U.S. and subsequent concerns about E&P cash flows, if I could ask you to start in focusing on North American land. You've been clear about your strategy of re-establishing yourselves here, and you've just given your outlook for a flat rig count, but does this very quickly deteriorating outlook for gas -- is it influencing recent contracting behavior in U.S. land? And then, I'll just give you my follow-up now, which is that is it influencing your behavior, whether it's from a contracting link standpoint or a CapEx standpoint? Are there any changes that you're making now?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at pressure pumping pricing levels, as I said, we continue to see downwards pressure on pricing in gas in Q4. The liquid basins, we saw pricing basically being flat, some contracts being up, and some contacts being down. Now how this is going to evolve, I think, is still uncertain at this stage, right? There is obviously a chance that the continued flux of capacity from the gas basins into the liquid basins is going to have an impact on liquids pricing as well. We haven't really seen any downwards trend yet. But clearly, over the past quarter, the pricing has been flat, so that's basically where we stand on that. In terms of our view on North America land, like we said before, we remain committed to the markets. We have a build plan for 2012, which is obviously flexible. But we will remain committed to the market in terms of adding capacity, provided that we can get the utilization that we are looking for, right? And so -- in addition to how we see the North America land market for pressure pumping, we have also significant demand for horsepower international. We won a lot of contracts in the international markets requiring fracturing capacity. So in the event that we have the opportunity or basically decide to ship capacity internationally, I think that will be welcomed by our international operations.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So that's still an "if" condition. You're -- so far, there will be plans for the U.S.
Paal Kibsgaard: It is still an "if" condition. We have basically decided on a build plan for total pressure pumping with a certain allocation to North America, and we haven't changed that at this stage.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just to clarify, from a contracting behavior, with your customers, are they -- are contracts getting longer? Are they -- are you seeking to make them longer or contract -- are your operator customers seeking to make them shorter now? How is that timing dynamic work?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say that over the past quarter, we have -- over the past couple of quarters, we have shifted more towards term contracts. We now stand at around 80% term contracts for one year plus. And really, the only plays we play in the spot market at this stage is in the liquids plays, right, so I think there's been a shift in the market towards term contracts, and I think we are quite well positioned in that sense.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John David Anderson from JPMorgan.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So you’d mentioned that North -- your outlook for North American rig count is flat this year. And you also said in your release that, basically, revenue is in line with the rig count, so -- which seemed to me that the upside here for you guys is really going to be in the Gulf of Mexico. And I was just wondering, if we strip out kind of the strength of kind of the seismic side, I'm curious as to where you are in your deepwater operations in the Gulf. Are you back to the kind of the pre-Macondo levels? Are costs now fully absorbed in that market? And I guess I'm just kind of wondering, are your margins now in the Gulf higher than in your U.S. land business?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. The simple answer to that is yes. This quarter, I think, was the first quarter where our Gulf of Mexico margins were accretive to North America. So obviously, there's been a lot of focus in on the multiclient sales for Q4, which was quite strong. But I think it's also important to point out the strength we have on the deepwater side for well operations, right, both Wireline and on the Drilling segments. So we're quite optimistic in terms of the outlook for the Gulf of Mexico, firstly, in terms of our market share position and in addition to how well we can leverage our high-end technology and operational performance in this type of market, right, so we see steady growth in deepwater drilling rig count during 2012, roughly about 1 rig a month. So we would be at pre-Macondo levels for drilling rigs in the deepwater by the latter part of 2012.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, that's great. And as a follow-up, I was wondering, can you just give us a sense as to kind of what's different now than before? I'm curious. We're seeing this on the rig equipment side that operators are clearly taking a much more conservative approach there. How has your business changed? Are you spending more time on the rigs that you're seeing now? Is it increasing testing? Is it more conservative operations? I was just wondering if you could just kind of give us a little insight in the how your operators are going about their business differently now.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think all the operators are obviously even more thorough than that they were in the past, right, but we haven't seen a dramatic change in how operations are conducted. I think there was always a lot of focus on this. But yes, there's probably somewhat more testing and maybe double and triple checking of things. But generally, our position in the Gulf of Mexico at this stage, given the focus that we had now for, what, 4 years in our excellence in execution program, is even stronger than what it was pre-Macondo. So we are very well positioned, and that's why we are obviously quite optimistic in terms of the outlook for the market and also how this is going to weigh in on our North America performance.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. But according to kind of what your comments are, this is probably where you'd see all your growth in North America, or that most of your growth would come from the deepwater side?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we don't know yet that. I mean, that's going be a large function of 2 things: what's going to happen to the rig count in terms of the reductions in gas versus potential increases in liquids; and even more so, what's going to happen to pressure pumping pricing.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Paal, I wanted to ask you a little bit with regard to the comment in the press release as it relates to competitive bidding on the large tenders for standard technology. I was just curious as to what do you need to see happen here? What are you expecting to happen over the course of 2012 to change that dynamic, number one? And I guess secondly, we’ve talked in the past certainly on Schlumberger's calls about the leverage to the exploration cycle. And clearly, people are encouraged where they continue to see deepwater adds here in the market globally. I was wondering if you could spend a little bit of time talking about the pricing outlook on the deepwater market globally here as well.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So like you say, I mean, we still see competitive pricing for basic technology on large contracts, while we see some positive signs on the smaller contracts. On the large contracts, our unique high-end technology is, obviously, priced higher, and we always have significant seller potential as the contracts unfold over the years. If you look at the international service pricing, typically, there is a lag between the moves and the rig rates, which we have been seeing over the last couple of quarters and our service pricing, right, so there is a potential upside on that. But I think one reason why pricing hasn't moved so much in the international market is the market share plays that have been going on. And I think these are potentially coming to an end. Partly, that's going to come down to the activity increase that we potentially will see. But I think also another key factor to this is that there is a growing customer emphasis on operational performance. I think they are fully realizing that very low service pricing typically gives very low service quality. And I think one example of this is the rate that we continue to replace competition within our Drilling & Measurements segments. In Q4 alone, the ratio of we replacing competition, and they -- and them replacing also us was 31:5, and this is basically coming down to quality and technology.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Sure. Is it still prudent to think of a pricing inflection internationally as being more of a positive for your kind of 2013 margin outlook? Or is this something that we potentially start to see having an impact in the second half of this year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think it's still too early to say. Like I said, we continue to test pricing on smaller bids. For the big bids, and there's not really that many big bids coming up in the coming year, we'd obviously be a little bit more conservative to make sure that we protect and potentially gain market share. But I think it's too early to call it. The only thing I would say is that there was a growing focus on operational performance, and that plays very well into our strength in terms of our quality and our technology.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And Paal, I just wonder whether you could help us a little bit of how to think about the first quarter. It's always sequentially a difficult one to get our heads around. This product sales in the fourth quarter, there is multiclient that doesn't necessarily repeat. You have seasonality in North Sea, Russia. Could you give us a little bit on how you would think about the first quarter and how it's shaping up? It just strikes me that expectations might be just a little bit on the high side of a natural range.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I would agree with you, Ole, that the current consensus is probably somewhat on the optimistic side or on the high side. Just to comment on how we see the quarter from this point, I think the underlying activity continues to be strong, and it's driven by steady growth in the international markets and also strong activity in North America shale liquids. Like you say, we are going to see the normal seasonal slowdown in the North Sea and Russia, and I think also the sequential drop in product sales and multiclient sales. I think, also, there is some added uncertainty going into Q1 now in terms of the impact of the accelerating drop in North America shale gas activity, right, so generally, I would say that the current consensus is somewhat on the optimistic…
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And from then on, it clearly becomes more of a standard pattern. But second thing, back to this international pricing again, I mean, rig rates, after deepwater rigs are becoming, again, very, very scarce, you highlighted what's going on in Angola pre-salt and the potential demand there. Rig rates may be pushing back to $600,000 again. I mean, historically, those have been levels where oil companies really start paying attention to technology that can improve reliability or technology that can shorten cycle time. And yes, you don't really talk about pricing, so could you help us a little bit with how you view the tightness in the rig market and the higher rates impacting either whether it's service quality for pricing or whether it's the standard technology or whether it's new technology?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. Like I said in the previous question, I think there is typically a lag between the moves in the rig rate and the moves in our service pricing. So I think that's the first point. But to your point in terms of what our customers are looking for, I think, like I said, there's a growing focus on operational performance. Obviously, that is even more where the rig rates are high, like in deepwater, but we also see that in more conventional offshore operations as well. So I think that international capacity is obviously one driver that's going to support pricing going forward because we don't see significant overcapacity in the international market. I think the main reason why there hasn't been more pricing movement is the market share plays that's been going on, right, so with the growing focus on operational performance, I think that is going to help drive pricing going forward. And again, that's what we are seeing on selected contracts even in Q4.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And these market share gains, are they offshore, or are they on big onshore contracts today?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think we've seen them basically in -- all over. So I mean, I think they are reducing in intensity as the 2011 was unfolding and potentially coming to an end, right, given this growing focus from our customers on operational performance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Paal, I have a question about seismic. Obviously, good finish to the year for the multiclient business, and I think your original expectations for the Marine side of the business, which we could see pricing power materialize around the middle of 2012. Given the Gulf coming back and your strong market share position there, given Angola pre-salt opening up in a big way here, is there the potential that -- one, that the pricing could move -- moves could be moved forward a little bit; and two, that the magnitude could actually be higher than perhaps you had originally expected?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I mean, I would answer the question along the lines that we do see the seismic market -- or the Marine seismic market tightening. So Q4 saw the expected drop in utilization, but that utilization kept growing during the quarter. Q1 is already looking up in utilization, and Q2 and Q3, it’s actually looking quite strong. So the Angola seismic commitments around the Kwanza block awards are going to draw several new vessels into that area. But Angola alone is not going to be able to create a global undersupply, but I think it's going to contribute significantly. So in addition to Angola, we see the North Sea and the Arctic looking quite strong for Q2 and Q3. And also, there's going to be likely stronger activity in the Gulf of Mexico in this coming year, right, so basically, we see the potential to drive pricing up as being a kind of a mid-year to a second half of this year event. The amplitude, I am not going to be able to comment on at this stage.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And how do you think about capacity additions at this point, both your capacity additions and industry capacity additions?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, there were -- I think 2011 capacity additions to the 3D market, I think, was in the range of 6 vessels. What seems to be on the slate for this year is 3. So I don't think these capacity additions are going to have any material impact to the -- to when the pricing inflection point is going to become. In terms of our capacity, we -- the first thing we would do is to convert some of the source vessels we have back to acquisition vessels, but we will only do this when we can assure that we get the utilization that we are looking for.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Paal, my initial question here is on the CapEx outlook that you got. I think it's $4.4 billion or so for 2012. I wonder if you could give us some general indication on how that might be weighted between international and North America. And then if you can, within that context, just give us some indication on how much you may have kind of put aside for your pressure pumping investment. Obviously, you don't -- I don't expect you to give us explicit numbers, but if you just give us some relative size, it would be really helpful.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So for the overall number, just to kind of let you know how we are planning the year, so we're going to look at the year in 2 halves basically. So in H1, we are going to continue to invest probably around the levels of the -- the average levels of 2011. And then we have secured capacity that's going to allow us to increase capacity with about 25% in the second half of the year. That's going to -- that can take us up to the $4.5 billion level. Whether we go ahead and spend all of the $4.5 billion is also going to be a function of how we see 2013 because a lot of the additions that we're going to be making in the second half of the year are going to be obviously coming into play and into real capacity in 2013. In terms of how we are planning to add numbers in international, this is obviously going to be fluid, all depending on how the 2 markets evolve, right, but we are -- we have capacity, and we are ready to add as much CapEx in North America in 2012 as we did in 2011. But we're going to be looking at this on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then once again, is it kind of 60% international, 40% North America? How would you think about the split?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I'm not going to be able to give you that number. I'm sorry.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: No worries, all right. Okay. And just quick follow-up on -- I think it was Ole's question a little bit earlier. You kind of referenced the, I think, Street consensus numbers being too high. I think you were referencing the first quarter specifically. Would you've been -- if that is true, how would you assess the full year consensus number as well?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think, commenting on the full year, I would refrain from at this stage. I think we -- again, we are looking at the year-end in 2 halves in that sense, right, so I think it's -- I wouldn't care to comment on the overall number.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Paal, with regard to getting back to seismic, Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale seems to be highly anticipated again on the part of E&Ps that I have spoken to. I believe that takes place this summer. Normally, multiclient spending patterns are very back-end weighted, as we saw in this fourth quarter. What do you expect will be the pattern of spending this year given the fact that such a big lease sale is coming this summer? Would we expect to see strong sales in Q1 and Q2? How should that unfold?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, first of all, the Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale has not been confirmed yet. It's likely to happen around midyear. We still believe it's going to happen around midyear. It hasn't been confirmed yet. If it goes ahead, and if it is announced, we expect there to be multiclient sales prior to that lease sale, right, so exactly what levels they're going to be, it's a bit difficult to predict. But if there's a mid-year lease sale, I think our H1 multiclient sales in North America could be stronger than what they've been in the last couple of years. We are also in a very good position in terms of the multiclient library we have in the Central Gulf, which also plays strongly into this.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Okay. Secondly and the follow-up here, your North American land margins in the first quarter, what did they do sequentially? Were they flat, up or down?
Paal Kibsgaard: Excuse me? Our North America land margins?
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Yes, sir.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, our North America land margins were up.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Scott Gruber from Bernstein.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Paal, you highlighted your forecast for about 10% international rig count growth, but clearly, activity growth is going to be biased to the offshore. So do you think customer spending could come any closer to 15% growth abroad?
Paal Kibsgaard: It's difficult to say. I mean, if you look at the surveys, they range a lot, right, so -- but I think with the additions of deepwater rigs happening this year, which is going to come into full fruition next year, and with continued spend in exploration, we are optimistic on our outlook for the international markets.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And I hate to continue to focus on offshore service pricing, but it's clearly a key point of controversy. Assuming that offshore spending -- that the bias in spending is toward the offshore, some of the guidance we're looking at suggests that spending could be up closer to 20% offshore, and I know that the industry has a fair amount of clarity on when that's going to hit and so therefore can be prepared for. But are they -- are the plans of your customers coming in above expectations? I mean, if the industry hits something close to 20% spending growth offshore, is the industry going be able to keep up from a supply standpoint based upon your own CapEx guidance and what you're seeing in the marketplace?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I think looking at what is going to drive part of the spending in the coming year, again, is deepwater and exploration. There's been a lot of exploration successes in the last year, which, again, makes us optimistic in terms of our view of next year. Looking at where we see most rig count growth, I think the -- in percentage terms, there's also a bias, like you indicate, in our view towards the offshore versus the land and the international market.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Are the spending plans of your customers coming in ahead of your expectations, particularly offshore?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, like I said, there's a range in what the spending plans for the customers are, right, so I think, generally, when we say that we expect the 10% rig count in the international market, I think that is based on what we have seen from our customers, and I think that is -- whether that is ahead or behind what we are expecting, I think that is what we're expecting.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Paal, my question has to do with the workflow around international shale activity and, in particular, referring to the comment in the press release on the Vaca Muerta shale work in Argentina. Sort of 2 parts to it. One, if we dial back 6 or 9 months ago, where would you say that workload is today relative to the expectation then, i.e. are we seeing sort of an acceleration, or are we tracking on plan? And then the second part of the question is, with respect to the work that you're doing around resource evaluation, how that might translate into sort of market share and the contract differences in international shale versus a U.S. shale like the Eagle Ford?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So just generally first on the international and conventional market, we are -- I'm very comfortable with our position there. So we won a number of contracts in all the 3 international areas, and these contracts typically entail both studies based on this shale reservoir characterization model, as well as the wellsite operations for drilling and completing and stimulating these wells. The -- what we see in the international market is that there's typically no work done on unconventional or shale without first starting up with these studies when it comes to the reservoir. And obviously, we are barely leading in the ability to do that, and that puts us in a very strong position in winning these initial study bids and then building on that into the wellsite operations, right. So like I said in the script, we won a number of these contracts in all parts of the world, and I would say that the increase in activity for us in international and conventionals over this year and going into next year is probably somewhat higher than where I thought it would be going back 2 or 3 quarters, right. So we expect to see strong growth in all the international shale plays for us in 2012. The work is still going to be around evaluation and pilot projects in general. But I mean, it's still going to represent very good growth for us. And I think the 2 markets that is going to take off the fastest, I would say, would be Argentina and China.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's great. And just to clarify then, Paal, that when you mentioned -- I think you said significant capacity wins overseas, you were specifically addressing Poland, China and Argentina?
Paal Kibsgaard: When I say that we would move significant capacity overseas?
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we added significant capacity in 2011, and we are prepared to continue to add it to the international market based on the activity that's coming up, right, but I would say that the countries that you mentioned, Poland, Argentina and China are probably some of the key ones. But I would say that there is a growing focus on unconventional and shale also in the Middle East, and we are ready to add significantly more capacity there as well as we continue to expand operations there.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Jim Crandell from Dahlman Rose. Well, we lost Mr. Crandell. We'll move on to Robin Shoemaker from Citi.
Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Paal, going back to your comments about large tenders with standard technology and the market share intense competition going on there, is that confined to the 3 large service companies you normally compete with? Or are there new entrants disrupting that kind of IPM work in terms of the pricing structure?
Paal Kibsgaard: No. For the high-end technologies, I would say the companies that we generally compete with are Halliburton and Baker.
Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. But on the -- what you called the standard technologies, is that you what you -- is that also the case?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I mean, on standard technologies and I would say on land contracts and so forth, it's Halliburton and Baker, and then also to an extent, Weatherford. Those are the main competitors. We don't see any other kind of new entrants into the market space that we are competing with at this stage.
Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And if I could ask you -- just if you could comment on this joint venture you signed with Petrofac and what kind of projects specifically that's targeting.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, so first of all, it's not a joint venture. It's a corporation agreement. And the kind of contract that we are looking to work with them on are these production incentive contracts, à la the one we signed in Mexico during the last quarter, right. So these production incentive contracts are contracts -- they are service contracts, but they are contracts where we are going to be paid and compensated based on the fee per barrel over an agreed baseline for the asset that we are managing. So the background for the agreement is that both Petrofac and ourselves, we have very complementary capabilities, and we also see this market in between a traditional service company model and the oil company model to do this incentive contract as a very interesting growth opportunity, having complementary capabilities, where we are very strong on the subsurface, production engineering, well construction and product management, while Petrofac has all the surface facility, design capability and, also, operational fee management. These are quite complementary, and it's going to help us basically to bid on projects of a scale that we probably wouldn't do independently, and we can also develop these at a much faster pace. So it is not a joint venture. It is a corporation agreement, where we're going to be bidding jointly on these type of contracts around the globe.
Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Just to clarify on those kind of contracts, the fee per barrel, would you expect your margins to be comparable to the kind of margins you generally achieve in that region?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we've been doing these type of contracts for almost 10 years. And this was actually -- the original intent of IPM was to get into these type of contracts. So we've been holding a portfolio of contracts for in between 5 and 10 years. Not many, but the ones that we've had and where we have actually developed our skill sets, which makes us confident to go for bigger projects now. For that portfolio, the margins on these contracts are highly accretive to our average margins.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Paal, I appreciate your color and your thoughts on North America. Certainly, still, at least in the liquid plays, a tight market or a relatively solid market, and margins are still obviously attractive around the 30%, 35% level. In your belief, in your thoughts when you think about North America in 2012, 2013, if pricing starts to decline more on a widespread basis, and we're now in the margins at the 20% to 25% level, do you think the market will start to pull back on capacity additions? Or is that still attractive enough margins that we still could see capacity adds at the margin or even more so?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, it's a bit difficult for me to predict what all the other ones are going to do, right, but I would say that we will continue to invest into this market provided that we can get decent utilizations on the assets, and as long as the pricing and the margins are still attractive enough. What that level is, I can't really give you a number on, Angie, but we also have, like I said, significant demand for this horsepower internationally, so we're going to have to be balancing off -- if something was to happen in North America to the extent of what you're saying, we will look at basically balancing off how we add capacity into the global market and based on the returns that we can get. But at the same time, I would just want to stress that we remain committed to the North America market, and we are looking to gain share at the back end of the Reservoir workflow that we have established and also HiWAY. And HiWAY -- in a market that is going towards equilibrium, HiWAY is going to give us both pricing and cost leverage into the market.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, okay, that's very, very helpful. And then one more, just as a follow-up on the margin side. Obviously, we're still seeing some competitive behavior for large projects but strength in some of the areas that you can add technology. I would assume that it's fair to assume a measured and moderate progression in margins internationally? And is there any regions that could be stronger or weaker than another?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would agree with your first statement that some measured improvement in 2012 margins internationally is reasonable to expect. I wouldn't care to comment on exactly where that would be.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Dahlman Rose.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Paal, can you comment about how you see your business under the Petrofac joint venture growing the types of projects that you're undertaking and maybe the risks associated with that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at the projects we're taking on, it's generally focused in on managing payout production in mature assets. We are looking at opportunities in various parts of the world. Obviously, there's upcoming bids in Mexico. There is other opportunities in South America, but also in the other areas, there are opportunities. And part of the opportunities are linked to a shortage of, I would say, operator capacity to handle this type of work where they’d rather prioritize, focusing in on high-end and new developments, right. So I think this is a growing market and something that we are looking to pursue. But maybe, Simon, do want to comment a little bit on how we handle these things from an accounting standpoint?
Simon Ayat: Yes, okay, sure. As Paal mentioned earlier, we do have several of these projects, although at the smaller scale. And basically, this project require a -- some investment upfront, which we -- basically, we will capitalize. And then as we go, we amortize it against the profile of the production or the enhanced production that we are compensated against. Normally, we have a very, very clear plan on the production profile and the baseline and the decline of the baseline. And we anticipate very well the type of compensation where we amortize the investment against. So as you all know, we do follow a pretty good balance sheet and, to some extent, I would say on the conservative side when it comes to things like this, so this will continue to be the style.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And as a follow-up question, Paal, being a couple of your major competitors have either strongly urged or almost required customers to take a number of their product lines if they're going to get their frac equipment, how does your strategy in terms of trying to package different Schlumberger product lines along with fracturing sort of compare with theirs?
Paal Kibsgaard: I missed the first part of your question. Repeat it, please.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Well, the first part, I think, is that your 2 largest competitors in North America in fracturing seem to be, if anything, requiring companies to take many of their other product lines if they're going to give them their frac equipment, all the way from requiring to maybe strongly suggesting. I'm wondering how your strategy in North American pressure pumping compares with that in terms of trying to convince companies to take different Schlumberger product lines along with the frac equipment on new builds.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, generally, we are -- when we work with our customers, they ultimately decide what they want to buy from us. When we have product lines that together can bring more value, we promote that to our customers. And if they see the value the same as us, then, typically, they will buy it. Now in terms of forcing them to do something, we never do that. And I think the forcing is going to go away because -- whenever the horsepower supply and demand reaches equilibrium.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Mike Urban from Deutsche Bank.
Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Paal, I wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments you've made on HiWAY. It sounds like you have made some pretty good progress from kind of a volume standpoint in stages run and also some headway internationally. And I think you suggested this, but just wanted to confirm that you do feel like you're at least beginning to get some of the pricing and, I guess, cost savings as well from that product. In other words, are you able to get the kind of benefits that you envisioned when you rolled out the technology just given that you are seeing a broader maturation of the pressure pumping market and things stabilizing and, as you said, in some cases declining.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, I think we are still very upbeat in terms of the performance of HiWAY and also the future potential that HiWAY brings, right. As I mentioned, we served over 35 customers in Q4, predominantly in the U.S. And while you introduce a new technology like this, it takes -- it basically takes some time from the initial jobs you do for one customer until you can broaden the application for a number of customers, right. So we had 50% growth in stages sequentially between Q3 and Q4, and I think this is a testament now to the customer base that we have established. And we continue to expand the customer base, and I think that's really what's going to help us further grow the service going forward. In terms of the jobs that we pumped or the stages we pumped in North America in Q4, probably only about 15% of the total stages we pumped were HiWAY, while we are really starting to expand in terms of the customer base, right. So I think there is significant potential as we go forward for HiWAY. And we also continue engineering efforts to extend the operating envelope in terms of lower temperatures and higher temperatures for HiWAY.
Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And then more broadly on the pumping market globally, you’ve talked about some of the flexibility that you hopefully have with respect to adapting the market and allocating capacity. Is that primarily with respect to the new capacity that you're building? And how much flexibility does that give you? And are you doing things like skid mounting? I mean, just trying to understand how much capacity could potentially move around relative to a pretty fluid and dynamic market.
Paal Kibsgaard: No. I would say a significant amount of our North America existing capacity can also be moved internationally if we want to. We have standardized the type of equipment that we are operating, and that can be moved internationally as well. I don't foresee that happening. I think the main thing we're talking about now is how do we allocate additions from this point onwards. But again, we have a standardized fleet, which is mobile to any part of the world.  Okay, so before we close, I have one last thing to add. This is the last call that Andrew will be attending. So having spent 37 years with Schlumberger, he steps down as Chairman in April of this year. So I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to thank him on behalf of the entire company for his outstanding contribution, and I wish him all the best in the future. I am sure that as a shareholder, he will listen to our future earnings calls, but I hope that Malcolm will not let him ask any questions. So Andrew, thank you again. And I now will hand the call back to Greg.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Keely. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Third Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Joining us on the call today are Andrew Gould, Chairman; Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paul. Simon will first review the financial results and Paul will discuss the operational and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges, was $0.98 per share. This is an increase of $0.11 sequentially, and $0.28 compared to the same quarter of last year.  During the quarter, we recorded $0.02 of charges relating to the continuing integration of Smith and Geoservices. Pretax operating income for Oilfield Services was $1.93 billion. This represents a $182 million sequential increase. Oilfield Services pretax operating income margin improved 77 basis points to 20.2%.  Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows: Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.5 billion and pretax operating income of $610 million were both flat sequentially. Revenue increases in Wireline and Testing Services due to strong exploration activity were offset in large part by WesternGeco, which was significantly impacted by lower marine vessel utilization on account of seasonal transits and higher docking time, as well as the startup delays in land seismic activities in the Middle East and Asia. Pretax margins were also flat at 24.5%, as the improvements in Wireline and Testing Services due to an improved revenue mix were offset by the impact of the vessel transits and project delays in WesternGeco.  Drilling Group third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion were 6% higher sequentially, while pretax operating income improved by almost 14% to $613 million. The revenue increase was led by M-I SWACO on higher activities in U.S. land unconventional plays combined with increases in deepwater activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil for both M-I SWACO and Drilling & Measurements. Pathfinder revenue grew on U.S. land, while other technologies improved following last quarter's spring break-up in Canada. Drilling Group pretax margin improved sequentially by 111 basis points to 16.7% as a result of the higher-margin offshore activities, the seasonal rig count recovery in Canada and better pricing and operating efficiencies in IPM.  Third quarter Reservoir Production revenue of $3.37 billion increased 10.2% sequentially, while pretax operating income improved by 15.5% to $707 million. Revenue increased sequentially, largely due to higher Well Services activities following the spring break-up in Canada. Well Services also had a strong performances on land in the U.S., as well as in Latin America and the Europe/CIS/Africa areas. Reservoir Production pretax margin improved 1 percentage point to 21%, primarily on Well Services increases in Canada and higher asset utilization in U.S. land.  Revenue for the Distribution segment increased almost 10% sequentially to $698 million, and the business contributed $31 million of pretax operating income.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. It's worth noting that the results in our Europe/CIS/Africa area continue to be burdened by cost relating to the Libya geo market. These costs adversely impacted the quarter's results by just over $0.01 per share. In addition, we lost $0.02 per share on the revaluation of certain foreign currencies denominated assets and liabilities, as a result of the significant strengthening of U.S. dollar against many currencies at the very end of the quarter. The impact of the revaluation process typically does not have a significant impact on us. However, this quarter, the foreign exchange movements in September were quite extraordinary, so I wanted to highlight this to you.  Schlumberger effective tax rate, excluding charges, was 23.7% as compared to 24.8% in the second quarter. The ETR for the full year is still expected to be in the mid-20s. We ended the quarter with $6.3 billion of cash and investments on hand and short-term debt of $2.7 billion. Net debt was $5.2 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $4.3 billion at the end of last quarter. During the quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue $1.1 billion of 5-year notes that bear interest at 1.95%, $1.6 billion of 10-year notes that bear interest at 3.3% and $300 million of 3-year floating rate notes. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included capital expenditure of $1 billion, $811 million of stock repurchases, as well as the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Framo engineering.  During the quarter, we repurchased 9.9 million shares at an average price of $81.86. CapEx for the -- all of Schlumberger is still expected to approach $4.2 billion in 2011. And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Our overall third quarter results continue to show solid progress, reflecting the trends we indicated in previous quarters. In North America, we saw strong growth on land and offshore, supported by a sequential increase in rig count and with further pricing momentum building in our Wireline and Drilling-related product lines. In the international markets, deepwater and exploration activity continue to strengthen, coinciding with a number of high-profile discoveries in several of the key basins around the world. While the international rig count continued to grow, we also saw early signs of pricing traction in our Wireline and Drilling & Measurements product lines during the quarter.  In North America, we had a strong quarter, with 15% sequential growth and with margins up 179 basis points. The results were driven by 3 things: first, strong seasonal growth in Canada, where the rig count currently is 31% higher than the same time last year; second, by solid growth in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where we continue to lead the market in both share and technical performance; and third, by continued growth in liquids-rich shale basins on land in the U.S.  The product line with the highest sequential revenue growth in North America was Wireline, driven by land and deepwater activity and further supported by continued pricing traction. Our Drilling product lines also saw strong revenue growth and pricing momentum during the quarter, driven by Pathfinder, Smith drill bits, M-I SWACO and Drilling & Measurements.  In pressure pumping, our completed stage count grew by more than 20% during the quarter, as we added a number of new frac fleets to the market and continue to convert crews from 12- to 24-hour operations.  During the quarter, pressure pumping pricing began flattening in the liquids-rich basins while we saw modest downwards pricing pressure in the gas basins. At WesternGeco, we continued shooting the Dual Coil survey in the Western Gulf of Mexico. We also started commercial trials of our new land seismic system, UniQ, in one of the U.S. shale basins. This was link to the Reservoir Characterization workflow we are introducing to the shale markets. Multiclient sales in North America remained at normal levels for the quarter.  Following the strong second quarter performance in the international markets, we saw a sequential growth in revenue of 2% in the third quarter, while margins contracted by 56 basis points. This is in line with a comment made in our second quarter earnings call, where we stated that international growth would not follow a straight line. Our Q3 results were also impacted by the sequential performance of WesternGeco, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.  In the Middle East and Asia area, revenue contracted by 4% sequentially, and margins were down 276 basis points. This was driven by WesternGeco, where we experienced significant start-up delays on several of our large land seismic projects. Multiclient sales were down sequentially, and marine revenue was also down in the region, due to dry docking of vessels and vessels transferring out of the regions as they completed their surveys.  Excluding WesternGeco, we still saw a sequential revenue growth in MEA driven by Iraq, Saudi Arabia and East Asia. In Iraq, we continued our strong performance in both revenue growth and margins. During the quarter, we won 3 new significant contracts that we have already started to mobilize. We are also continuing to bring the Smith product lines into the country, as well as further building our presence in Kurdistan.  In Saudi Arabia, the ramp-up plans for new rigs remain in place, with some limited slippage. In addition, rig-less activity in Saudi Arabia showed strong growth both in pressure pumping as well as in Wireline and intervention services. In East Asia, we saw strong growth in development activity in Malaysia, as well as higher exploration activity in Vietnam. Following the 14% sequential growth in Q2, Latin America posted 5% sequential growth in Q3, while margins contracted by 163 basis points due to changes in the revenue mix.  During the quarter, Mexico posted the strongest growth, driven by higher IPM activity as well as higher offshore activity. Argentina also saw robust growth driven by shale gas activity, where they conducted a number of frac jobs during the quarter and where we continue to build infrastructure and service capacity. In Brazil, activity remained strong, driven by both land and offshore, and we secured the main share or the multi-year Petrobras Wireline contract which was awarded during the quarter. In Europe/CIS/Africa, we continue to show good progress with 5% sequential revenue growth and margins up 236 basis points, driven by increased demand for our high-end exploration services and further supported by good cost management.  During the quarter, Russia reached a new oil production record in the post-Soviet era, and activity levels in Western Siberia and Sakhalin continue to see strong growth as overall investment sentiment in our customer base remains positive. We continued to strengthen our position in the Russian market with the award of all the services for the first project in the Russian Arctic, while the integration of the new services from the Eurasia transaction continued to progress on plan.  In the North sea, we saw strong growth, driven by high-exploration activity in the U.K. and Greenland, partly offset by lower activity in Norway due to annual platform maintenance. In Poland, we performed several multistage frac jobs as part of the ongoing shale gas exploration and appraisal progress, and we continue to build infrastructure and service capacity in the country. Angola saw strong growth in both pre-sold exploration activity and development activity in the main projects.  Activity in North Africa, East Africa and the Gulf of Guinea remained flat during the quarter, but are currently expected to resume the growth trends in the fourth quarter. Libya activity remained shut down for the quarter, but we currently have people on the ground and expect to resume some activity during the fourth quarter.  Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights of the quarter. In Reservoir Characterization, we have, over the past quarters, seen the start of a new exploration cycle through the demand for high-end Wireline and well testing services. Given the complexity and costs of these exploration campaigns, the need to de-risk potential prospects is becoming ever more important. While seismic technology advances have made significant contributions to better evaluate structural risks, almost 3/4 of the dry exploration wells are due to lack of understanding of seal and charge risks. These risks can be better addressed through petroleum system modeling, which looks at the formation and movement of hydrocarbons over time.  We are the only provider of a fully software-enabled workflow built on Petrel that cover seismic and petrophysical interpretation, as well as petroleum system modeling. The sale of this workflow is showing very good growth as it allows us to better help our customers reevaluate the exploration potential of mature basins and also further de-risk prospects of frontier areas.  In the Drilling Group, the Smith integration continues to progress well, and cost and revenue synergies are set to exceed even our revised targets for the year. The combination of Schlumberger and Smith drilling technologies continue to drive drilling performance for our customers, as you can see from the press release. The Smith transaction also continued to be accretive on an earnings per share basis in the third quarter.  Drilling & Measurements continue to penetrate the market with their latest technologies, including the PowerDrive Archer high build rate rotary steerable system, the Scope service and the latest MicroScope formation imager. During the quarter, a number of high-profile jobs were conducted successfully with these technologies for customers throughout the world.  In the Reservoir Production group, deployment of HiWAY technology in the pressure pumping market continues to grow. In North America, the number of customers using HiWAY had grown from 2 only a year ago to more than 20 today, and we completed over 800 stages during the quarter in this market alone. HiWAY continues to deliver higher gas and liquid production, while using significantly less water and proppant compared to conventional fracturing systems. This provides us with significant pricing and cost leverage versus our competitors, a factor that will become even more important when the North America pressure pumping market eventually become saturated with hydraulic horsepower. I would also add that HiWAY is starting to gain momentum in the international markets, including Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.  Turning now to the outlook. The current financial turmoil has already resulted in a lower outlook for oil demand growth in 2012, although demand growth is still expected to exceed that of 2011. However, recent production data, as well as forward projections, indicate that there is a tight cushion of excess oil supply that will continue to support activity. Therefore, while the financial turmoil introduces some uncertainty over near-term activity, it has yet to have an impact on the actual activity of our customers. We also remain confident that any potential reductions will be short-lived and that the outlook for the service industry remains very positive. We further believe that our customers' drive to renew reserves, as evidenced by the recent string of exploration successes, particularly in deepwater offshore areas, favors our broad international footprint. In addition, the balance between our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and production technologies both in North America and overseas will enable us to weather any activity fluctuations. Thank you very much. I would now hand the call over for the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Anderson with JPMorgan.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Thanks for the update on your outlook there, and this is what I want to touch a little bit more in depth. The service talks have hit really a rough patch over the last couple of months. Investors are clearly concerned about the timing. International is getting pushed out, and North America markets kind of roll. So I wonder if you could just kind of dig in a little bit more in terms of your outlook over the next 12 to 18 months. In particular, which regions or countries do you think are going to be big drivers? And I guess more specifically, kind of what's the tone been like with your NOC customers? Are you getting any sense of their concern? Are they just going to continue to move ahead with their projects? You mentioned a little slippage in Saudi, but it didn't sound like you were all that concerned there.
Paal Kibsgaard: No. Just to answer the last part of your question first, the feedback we have from our NOC customers is that they are continuing with the programs that they already have in place. They are clearly long-term investors and the projects that they have is for the long term, so we have really seen no change to their plans whatsoever. Now if I look at the next 12 to 18 months, or 2012 in particular, firstly at the international market -- so provided that there is no major impact from the European debt crisis on our business and we haven't seen any impact yet, we basically maintain quite a positive outlook on the international markets, and this is really driven by our customers that have a long-term view in areas such as Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Russia, Iraq and West Africa. And this trend is also further supported by strong underlying trends in both exploration and deepwater. I think in exploration there's a clear need to have reserves for our customers after the investment levels over the past 2, 3 years have been severely cut. And I think they are generally encouraged by the string of exploration successes globally that we've seen in the past couple of quarters. And similarly on the deepwater side, 2011 is going to see the highest number of newbuild arrivals ever. The total number is going to be around 36, which obviously will have a positive impact on the deepwater activity in 2012. And we also see quite positive trends for contracts for these newbuild arrivals and also for overall utilization and rig rates. Now if we switch to North America, we see basically higher level of uncertainty around North America. Now in North America, we're quite positive on Canada and Gulf of Mexico. We think both of them are going to be quite strong for the next year, and we have obviously very good market positions in both these markets. So I would say that the main uncertainty we see in North America is around pressure pumping pricing. And this is linked really to the amount of new horsepower capacity that is coming into the market, and there's also some concern on the cost inflation that we are seeing currently. So I think that's basically a high-level outlook of how I see it. Andrew, do you want to add something on the overall macro view?
Andrew Gould: Yes. I think we've said before and I'll say again, that the thing our customers dislike most, just like financial markets, is uncertainty. And I think that you have to assume that before 2012 starts, the European Union will come to some sort of resolution on their sovereign debt crisis. And if you couple that with the fact that actually, the supply situation is probably the tightest it's been since 2006, it's certainly tighter now than it was in 2008. And if you look at the U.S. inventories yesterday, they went below the 5-year average both for products and crude for the first time since 2008. So absent a really deep cut in demand, which would basically mean the developing economies going into recession, there's no reason at this point in time to suppose that international activity is not going to remain pretty robust in the year to come. And I totally subscribe to everything that Paal just said about deepwater exploration. The rate of success over the last quarter -- 2 quarters and actually ongoing success is really quite remarkable, and that's only going to encourage more of it.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So, Paal, as a follow-up on the exploration side, you're talking about that picking up. Is that in your numbers yet in terms of the growth? I mean, is there a way to kind of help us understand how much of the growth internationally, say, over the last several quarter come from exploration? Or is that going to come in as we kind of go through 2012? Is that kind of the real kind of growth part that you're seeing?
Paal Kibsgaard: Some of the exploration activity is obviously in our numbers and if you look at all the discoveries that we've seen, in particular over the past quarter. But I would say there is still significant growth potential in this. One discovery obviously creates a lot of additional activity around that discovery. And I think there's also a strong inventory of prospects that our customers are going to pursue. So I would say that while we have seen some increase in the high-end sales of services for both Wireline and testing and as well as in exploration software over the recent quarters, I think there is still significant upside in exploration going into next year.
Operator: And we'll go next to the line of Brad Handler at Crédit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess I'd like to follow-up on the outlook, if I may, but the first question actually pertains a little bit more to Q4, if we could bring in the time horizon. I guess really the easy way to put it, there's some pretty -- what seems like some pretty aggressive revenue growth outlooks embedded within current consensus thinking on Q4. So maybe I could ask you to reach beyond what you would normally do with respect to sort of expectation setting and say, is it reasonable to expect sort of double-digit growth globally in Q4 on the revenue side?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So normally, we don't go into details of the coming quarter, right? So I wouldn't comment specifically on how I see revenue growth going up. But my general comment would be that there is -- provided there's no significant changes to the plans for Q4 that we see from our customers at this stage, we firstly expect Q4 to show continued progress in line with the underlying trends that we have kind of outlined throughout the year. Looking at the consensus for Q4, I would say though that the current estimates that we see, I would say are somewhat on the optimistic side.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, I appreciate that. I guess as a somewhat related follow-up, but going back your commentary about the deepwater rigs coming in, the numbers are very impressive. You talk about floating rigs up. You're looking at deepwater floaters up 16% year-on-year in terms of supply in '12 by our count. Is that -- is it reasonable therefore for us to think about your offshore business in '12 as doing somewhat better than that? I mean, assuming you're keeping market share and exploration weighted activity helping your relative position. Is that how you're thinking about the '12 opportunity in the offshore, that you could be approaching 20% revenue growth year-on-year?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well again, I wouldn't comment straight on the percentage number. But I would say that I share your positive view on the activity outlook for deepwater. I think if you look at our market share position, it is already quite good. I would also say that the sell-off potential and the draw on high-end services that I would see going into 2012 for these type of operations is also quite good. So I think we are very well placed in terms of being on the deepwater rigs, and we have a very high, I would say, value outlook on the -- on our technology portfolio going into next year.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Kurt Hallead at RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I was just curious if you can give us some indication on the Iraqi operations. What kind of revenue run rate are you right now? And you mentioned that -- you mentioned something about profitability, so I guess we can all assume that you are currently profitable and not waiting to be profitable like maybe some of your competitors. So in that context, can you just give us some general sense of kind of what the revenue run rate is in Iraq? And if you were to look at the profitability in Iraq, is that above or below what your Middle East, Far East margins are currently?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So looking at the Q3 performance, we showed continued progress in terms of activity, and we set new records in terms of revenue and margins. So the numbers I gave you after the Q2 call -- broke [ph] $100 million for the quarter in Q2. For Q3, we had double-digit revenue growth. And if you look at the Schlumberger legacy business, which makes up over 90% of our Iraqi revenue, we have over 20% IBT for the full quarter. Now for the Smith segments that we are bringing -- we're currently bringing into the country, they are somewhat lower because we have significant startup costs as we bring them into the country. Now during Q3, we also got extensions for several of our existing contracts, and we were also awarded 3 new significant contracts that we are already mobilizing for. So I would say that we are not waiting to be profitable in Iraq. We are very profitable. And if you look at that profitability number that I just gave you, that is now getting very close to the average of MEA.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Great. And then follow-up would be, getting a number of questions from varying investors about if you took the seismic impact away for the third quarter, what would the international revenue growth rate and what would international margins look like if it were not for the impacts on seismic? And I was wondering if you could provide us with some more color on that. Once again, it is a topic of high interest for a lot that are listening to the call.
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I understand. So like we said -- like I said in my prepared remarks, most of the impact of WesternGeco seismic was -- we saw that in MEA. There was some limited impact in LAM, but not as significant as in MEA. If you look at MEA and you take seismic out, the growth in MEA was pretty much in line with the growth in the rig count, and the profitability of MEA was more or less in line with the previous quarter. Maybe slightly down, but more or less in line with the previous quarter.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So, Andrew, I presume this will be your last conference call, so I will take the opportunity to kind of tap into your global perspective and backdrop. And clearly, the balance and development in the spare capacity in the oil market near term is of great interest to everybody right now. And I wonder whether you could share your high-level thoughts there. Libya is coming back. Things are going on in Iraq. North Sea might be coming back. Should we be concerned about buildup of spare capacity in the global oil market on a, say, 6 months view?
Andrew Gould: I don't think so. I mean I don't think any of the single events you mentioned are significant enough to make a fundamental difference in an 85 million, 86 million barrel-a-day scenario. There's always going to be something else that goes down. None of these are increments that are really going to change the overall balance. The only thing that would change the overall balance will be a demand drop. And actually so far the signs of a demand drop even in the OECD are not particularly powerful. So I don't see it. I don't see that supply could change the picture in the short term. And by the way, Ole, if Paal invites me, I will come and say goodbye to you in January.
Paal Kibsgaard: We'll invite you, Andrew.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: We'd appreciate that. Any other sort of thoughts, Andrew, on what you think the market vibe might be under-appreciating now given the amount of stress in your stock and...
Andrew Gould: Well, I think it's not just our stock. I think a lot of quality stocks, there's a dislocation between market sentiment and the underlying realities. And that dislocation, as I sort of said earlier, I think is likely due to uncertainty, which everybody hates, which is why some form of resolution to the European sovereign debt crisis, which is going to come, is likely to be an event that will settle people's nerves. But a lot of industries, not just ours, the fundamentals are not nearly as bad as people seem to imagine. They are anticipating the worst.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Good to hear. And, Paal, you did comment on the fourth quarter, so you did open that Pandora's box. You did suggest it was somewhat optimistic. But is it completely crazy? Or I mean, you do have a fourth quarter which is going to be a seismic rebound. I mean, clearly what happened in the Middle East region on contract seismic should normalize. There are other factors that are seasonally strong in the fourth quarter. So I mean, is it completely crazy? Or is it is slightly optimistic? And I do realize that as the incoming CEO, you will not set the bar low, so let's get that out of the way.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think we've normally gone further than what we normally do on this. So I'm not going to go further than what I already said. I think the current consensus is somewhat on the optimistic side.
Operator: And we'll go next to the line of Bill Sanchez at Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Paal, I just want to circle back on the Latin America margin performance. I know you mentioned mix in the quarter here. Just curious, strong revenue quarter yet margins are down in total. Brazil was mentioned on the Geco side. You mentioned the IPM project in Mexico. Can you talk a little bit more about the margin degradation you saw sequentially there, and then just near-term outlook there going forward?
Paal Kibsgaard: Just focusing first on the margin, I'm not really worried about the Latin America margins. The reason why it dropped during Q3 is down to the revenue mix. If you look at where we grew the most, it was in Mexico and Argentina, and that had some impact on the overall margins. Brazil was still good. We had some impact from Columbia as well on an IPM production incentive project there, where we had some shortening of production. But in addition to that, the oil price obviously was down during the quarter as well, which had some impact. So when you said the overall underlying margin in Latin America, I'm quite comfortable with. In terms of the outlook, I think that's quite positive. Mexico continues to add rigs offshore and mainly on shallow water, but also some in the deepwater. We've seen a rebound in the IPM activity, both on the Mesozoic Aliansan [ph] and Chicontepec, which sort of bodes well for our Mexico outlook. And we also got 1 out of the 3 first production incentive contracts awarded in Mexico as well. So I would say, generally our outlook for Mexico is good. Brazil, as you all know, is obviously very strong. There's a continued influx of deepwater rigs in Q4. We're probably going to reach up to 64 rigs by year end in Brazil. All customers are active, both Petrobras, the IOCs and the independents. And we're also seeing a pickup in activity in Argentina related to shale gas, as well as strong activity both in Colombia and to a certain extent in Venezuela. So I think overall, Latin America is looking strong.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: And as my follow-up, Paal, you reiterated again this quarter -- or it was discussed again about North America pricing momentum led by Drilling and Wireline, and you made commentary with regard to your pressure pumping outlook. Do you see the Drilling and Wireline product lines pushing net pricing higher for you in the U.S. and North America as a whole, certainly given your outlook of a more challenging backdrop on the pressure pumping side?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think there's still more lag to pricing in both Drilling and Wireline. I think we're seeing a flattening of pricing to a certain extent on pressure pumping. I think what is also going to drive the mix of the pricing in North America is Gulf of Mexico, which is -- we are now adding one deepwater rig per month. We have a very strong market share position both on Drilling and on Wireline in the Gulf of Mexico. So I think the overall pricing for -- both those market segments still have upside on the pricing side in NAM.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: And enough as you see it, given that mix, to absorb the cost inflation that seems to be prevalent now in the industry, in the U.S.?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think cost inflation is one. But I think what is more interesting is what's going to happen to the pressure pumping pricing. As at some stage, we will approach more than equilibrium in terms of horsepower supply and demand. And so we are obviously doing what we can to manage the cost inflation on the pressure pumping side. I think what is going to be more dominant or more important is going to be what happens to the pricing going forward on pressure pumping.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of James West of Barclays Capital.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Paal, the issues at WesternGeco this quarter seemed pretty transitory to me. So I think, one, is that the case? And then what's the outlook on the seismic business for the rest of this year and into next year? And are we at the point now where you think we can get some real pricing traction on the Marine side?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So in general, I would say that we are still quite positive when it comes our seismic outlook. Now if you look at the Marine market, Q4 and Q1 are normally softer quarters, as the vessels finish off mainly the North sea season. Now this year, we were expecting higher activity in West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, and we also expected that this type of activity would offset the seasonal softness or weakness that I just referred to. And the fact that we would have higher of activity in West Africa and Gulf of Mexico would present some opportunity to test pricing. Now what we've seen in reality is that the ramp-up of activity in both places have been slower than expected, but we don't see this as being structural. There's basically delay in signing of contracts and also somewhat slower mobilization of additional vessels into the Gulf of Mexico. So I think we would see the normal softness that we see every year in Q4 and Q1 on Marine. But looking forward to Q2 and Q3 of 2012, the slate is already filling up quite nicely there. There's very good tender activity for all the basins: North Sea, Barents Sea, Angola, Brazil and so forth. So the outlook for 2012 is, I think, still quite positive. We were hoping to get some pricing traction at the end of this year. I think this is now pushed out a couple of quarters. But beyond that, we remain still quite optimistic and positive on the seismic market.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And with respect to near-term quarters, would the multiclient data library sales offset some of that vessel weakness? I mean, would 4Q WesternGeco be weaker than 3Q? I mean, 3Q seemed to have more one-off issues.
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, absolutely. So the third quarter had a number of one-off issue. I think overall WesternGeco will be up in Q4, and that would in part be driven by higher multiclient sales. But I think also, some of the issues we had both on land and Marine are being rectified and we will have stronger performance, I would say, in all product lines of WesternGeco in Q4.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to try to reconcile a little bit just this color on the international growth rates and your optimism. One of the differences that I see in Schlumberger's portfolio is the mix of rig-less services, excluding seismic. And I was hoping, Paal, maybe you could contrast sort of growth rates in rig-less capabilities relative to rig count or just sort of general wellbore construction. And maybe highlight some product and service lines and geographies where growth is perhaps a bit stronger.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I would say overall in the rig-less activity, we have seen pretty good growth in recent quarters and I expect that to continue into 2012. I think part of our portfolio that is probably somewhat underestimated is our abilities within rig-less from Wireline cased hole to coiled tubing and to slickline, where we have #1 market positions in all of these product lines. So I'm -- we are putting a lot of effort into growing this part of our business, and I'm quite optimistic in terms of how these product lines are going to perform going into next year. And I think where you'll probably see more on growth in these type of product lines is partly on land. Now there's also opportunities offshoring it, right? But generally, I think we'll see strong growth in the rig-less activity going into next year.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Stronger than wellbore construction, do you think?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think there's still some uncertainty around wellbore constructions when it comes overall rig count and so forth. But I thought this is more independent to the rig count, right? So it all depends on what happens on the rig count growth. It's a bit difficult to say. But the fact that it's going to represent strong growth, I'm quite confident in.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: And, Andrew, maybe I could address the second one to you. As it pertains to some of the technologies around completion, I think that you sort of set the high bar of expectation in terms of the migration of moving from brute force to more intelligent drilling and completion activity. But it strikes me as we move in that direction that -- with HiWAY and the reference to COPPERHEAD in the press release, that there's a portfolio of capabilities, call them incremental technologies, that are moving us in that direction and sort of getting away from just pure horsepower more immediately than sort of waiting for the drill-perfect kind of solution. Can you talk about that portfolio perhaps, and put COPPERHEAD and HiWAY within that context?
Andrew Gould: I think what -- it's perhaps important to start by saying is that when I said brute force and ignorance, I never for a moment imagined that hydraulic fracturing is going to disappear. But firstly, proper characterization will reduce the necessity to geometrically frac in order to obtain a correct IP and therefore, eliminate a large amount of waste. And products like HiWAY or COPPERHEAD or other things that we're working on in Well Services in particular, will serve to provide, as HiWAY does, a better frac but using less proppant, sand, chemical and all the rest of it. So we don't -- we're not, for a minute -- that we're going to apply the unconventional just to our Reservoir Characterization workflow. It is also technology we're working on in both pressure pumping and in completions. It's a suite. But the big step forward, and you may have noticed as well that Paal referred in his commentary to the fact that we now have a unique seismic spread in one of the unconventional basins on land in North America, which is beginning to show that -- the appreciation that proper characterization before you start frac-ing is going to save you a lot of money.
Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So is it fair to say that, in effect, the value creation comes from not just the application of more intelligence and characterization, but also in the reduction of capital intensity?
Andrew Gould: Absolutely, absolutely. I'm still convinced that long term, the cost of producing unconventional gas is going to decline.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Paal, and I guess Simon as well. In light of your commentary, Paal, with regard to a transition in pressure pumping pricing in North America likely at hand, how should we think about the 2012 capital spending budget at this juncture? Is it likely to be up year-over-year? Or what's the likely path on that front?
Paal Kibsgaard: So if you look at our original plans for 2012, we were looking to add from the 2011 levels. We are maintaining our capacity to add both from a supplier and from a manufacturing standpoint. I'm not talking about global CapEx. To what extent we will add, I think, is going to be a function of what comes out of the budgeting cycle of our customers. But generally, we are maintaining our capacity to add CapEx going into 2012.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: All right, so capital spending translation is likely higher year-over-year.
Paal Kibsgaard: I think it generally will be higher. To what level higher, I think we'll come back to you in a quarter's time.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Understood. And then secondly, you guys I think have been sensibly balanced, if you will, with regard to the evolution of the development of the international unconventional resource. And yet, you read through this release and you have more than a few wins here with regard to what's going on in Poland, in Argentina and using HiWAY in North Africa and what have you. Do you have an update with regard to what your expected timeline is with regard to the blossoming of the unconventional play? And is it evolving more quickly than what you thought maybe a couple of quarters ago?
Paal Kibsgaard: So I think we've always been, I would say, positive on the outlook for unconventional resources internationally. If you look at some of the reports coming back, the estimated resource base for unconventional gas overseas is 6x that of the U.S. So I think we've always been positive on that. I think the main thing we've been saying is firstly, that we're going to have to go through a phase of exploration and appraisal to understand these resources internationally. And I think also, the approach to how they are going to be developed are going to be different than what we do in North America, and more in line with what Andrew just described, which is focused on a more scientific approach where there is more upfront investment in the characterization, and also it's going to have to be focused on using less resources for the drilling and completions of these wells as well. So we are actively pursuing all these exploration and appraisal projects in all parts of the world, whether this is Argentina, Colombia, Canada, Poland, India and China and so forth, right? So we are, I think, very well placed to play a strong role in the international shale market. I think the volume of activity is still going to take some time before it gets there, but I think there's been encouraging results from the exploration and appraisal projects. So I think the outlook is positive, but it's not going to be as significant as what we have seen in North America over the 4 -- in the past 4 or 5 years, in the coming years at least.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Okay, and if I could slip on in here with Simon. Simon, do you have handy what the sequential revenue increase was in U.S. and Canada, respectively?
Simon Ayat: Of course I have them. But we've seen the 15% overall NAM increase and we'll leave it at that. I'm not going to separate it between Canada and the U.S., but Canada had a significant increase obviously because of the spring break-up.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Jim Crandell at Dahlman Rose.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Andrew and Paal, you spoke very positively about the outlook for deepwater. And one of your -- I believe one of your competitors said the most competitive pricing part of the market was in deepwater and on longer contracts, and you talked about some improvement. Are you actually seeing some improvement in the deepwater area in terms of pricing? Or is that an area that's not really shown improvement in pricing and you're getting it somewhere else?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, if you look at the deepwater pricing, the -- I would say it's still generally competitive. But I think what we see on the deepwater side is that there is a continued, I would say, value puts on our technology and the integrity that we have of our operations, right? So in some cases, we are able to get a pricing premium for the performance that we are able to offer up on these very highly expensive rigs. There's also been an increase though on the high-end services that we offer up as part of the contracts on these rigs, right? So I think overall pricing on deepwater, we are -- I'm quite happy with.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And, Paal, what -- different subject, but what new or recent technology introduction with Schlumberger, let's say, over the last year to 18 months, do you feel will have the biggest commercial impact on the company in 2012?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I don't know. If I single out one, then I'm going to get a lot of my segments upset, right, so I'm going to have to be careful with that. But I would say that if I look at some of the key introductions that we've done over the past year, I would say for Wireline, I have a lot of hope and faith in the Dielectric Scanner. I think what this can offer up in terms of high-end petrophysical evaluations is going to be good. I referenced in my prepared remarks several D&M technologies: PowerDrive Archer, MicroScope, SonicScope. These are all, I think, going to have -- they're going to create very good value for Drilling & Measurement. We've also introduced several new drill bits technologies, in particular the spare bits, which is focused in on unconventionals, which I think is going to be good. And obviously HiWAY, without saying, has a very significant impact today. And I think as we continue to widen the customer base for HiWAY, it's going to have a very significant impact on pressure pumping both in North America and overseas. And then one other key technology, which again Andrew referenced, is the UniQ land seismic. This is a single-sensor land seismic system where you can basically house up to 100,000 channels, and it's going to give us a lot better quality images for both structure and also for endorsing the rest of our properties. And then the last part, which I also referenced in my prepared remarks, is our abilities now in terms of exploration software and petroleum system modeling. These are some of the key technologies that we have introduced, which I have a lot of faith in going forward.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and one quick one for Andrew. Andrew, after the elections in Mexico, would you expect drilling in Chicontepec to come back significantly? And if so, what sort of form do you think the contracts could take over there?
Andrew Gould: Look, I don't think that the elections have a huge impact on spending in Chicontepec. What will have an impact on spending in Chicontepec, and so far we don't seem to have a clear case, is a method of improving their recovery from this reservoir, which as you know, is extremely difficult. And while there are lots of different experiments going on, I don't think there's a conclusion on it yet. So I don't think the election will have any effect.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, so you really would not expect at this point Chicontepec to come back to any meaningful extent in 2012.
Andrew Gould: Only if Pemex is satisfied that one of the technologies that they're applying to improve recovery is really working.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Angie Sedita at UBS.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. Clearly, the international and deepwater recoveries is far and away the bigger story for Schlumberger. But on North America, you touched on the uncertainty in pressure pumping pricing. Given the capacity that we're adding today and next year, do you think in a flat rig market in the U.S. that we could reach a balanced or oversupply scenario in 2012? And then your thoughts on your North American margins in a flat rig market in 2012.
Paal Kibsgaard: So in terms of trying to predict when we're getting to horsepower balance in terms of supply and demand, I'm not going to do that. I -- obviously, with a flatter rig count it's likely to happen sooner, but I'm not going to venture out and say exactly when that's going to happen. I think the impact on pricing will be a function of when it happens, but it's also going to be a question of when we think it's going to happen. So I think you will have impact on pricing even before you actually get to saturation, right? If you look at our plans with that backdrop, we are at this stage continuing to add horsepower, and we will continue to add horsepower until we see an actual change in the market, that being either change to our customer plans or change to the utilization of our assets. And we haven't really seen anything in terms of these changes yet. But we are continuing to add, and the reason for this is that we are actually looking to gain pressure pumping market share. And we are looking to gain share through our HiWAY technology, and also by bundling our pressure pumping with the shale reservoir characterization workflow that we have highlighted, right? So we are continuing to add the function of when the supply and demand is going to meet in horsepower. I'm not going to make a prediction on when it's going to happen. It will eventually happen. I think that's what I would say.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, and then a follow-up to that. So the horsepower that you're adding, are you -- are your plans only for the first 6 months of the year? Or is it so far for the full year? And then how much of your frac fleet is under term today?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we have a relative flexible way of handling how we add the resources, right? So we have a very good relationship with our suppliers here. So we are looking out for -- in various time horizons. So I'm not going to say exactly how we're going to add quarter-by-quarter. But we are -- we have the capacity to add throughout next year if we choose to. In terms of what part of contracts we have on terms, there's still a good mix between our spot market and longer-term contracts.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then touching back on the fourth quarter. You touched on revenues, but a little bit on margins. Broadside on North America with the seasonality going into Q4, could you see some modest margin pressure just due to the holidays? And then thoughts on your international margins for Q4. In Q3 you were at 18%. With the seasonal jump in Q4, could you move to the 20% range?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I'm going to have to give you the same answer I gave to Ole, right. We have already ventured further off than what we typically do in indicating what's going to happen to the next quarter. So I would just reiterate that the EPS consensus estimate at this stage is probably on the optimistic side.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then finally, in the international markets, is there any market that you're concerned that may be slow or sluggish versus the areas that you pointed out that should be quite strong in 2012?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I think in general not. We've indicated in the Q2 call that the growth in international market is not going to be linear. So you will always potentially have an off quarter in some of these markets. But generally, I don't have any particular concerns in any parts of the international market in terms of the growth potential.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: The U.K. North Sea should be...
Andrew Gould: I get it; I get it. Cut her off.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: The outlook for the U.K. North Sea should be okay, flat, not down.
Andrew Gould: Angie, it's Andrew. Can I remind you our rules? It's one question and one follow-up. And we do need to get our last question in. Thank you, Angie.
Operator: And our last question will come from the line of Geoff Kieburtz at Weeden & Co.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division: Paal, just to clarify a comment I think you made during your prepared comments that pressure pumping pricing has flattened in the liquids market and declined in the gas regions. If that's right, then pressure pumping prices fell in the third quarter. Can you clarify what you said earlier?
Paal Kibsgaard: I was saying that the pressure pumping pricing in the liquids-rich basins was flattening during the quarter, but we saw a modest drop in prices in the gas basin.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division: So overall, pressure pumping prices still climbed in the third quarter.
Paal Kibsgaard: Slightly.
Andrew Gould: They climbed slightly, yes.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division: Okay, all right. And not to be too cute, Schlumberger has forecasted a rolling over of pressure pumping margins and pricing several times in the past. What -- and I understand your point that it will happen at some point, but are you seeing things -- and perhaps it's just what you just said, the pricing -- that makes you more certain that it is going to happen and it's going to happen in a reasonably near future?
Paal Kibsgaard: So again, I'm not saying that it's going to happen in the near future. I'm just saying that during the third quarter, we saw flattening of the liquids-rich basin pricing, which we haven't seen in recent quarter -- quarters. And I'm also saying that there is a significant amount of horsepower coming into the market as we speak and also going into next year. So my concern on the North America outlook is what is going to happen to pressure pumping pricing.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division: Right, okay. And on HiWAY, kind of a technical question I guess. My recollection was at the analyst event this year, that at that time, HiWAY wasn't delivering a reduction in water usage but now, clearly, it is. Is HiWAY -- should we be thinking about HiWAY as still an evolving and developing technology?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think, absolutely. So whether you reduce only proppant or whether you reduce proppant, water and potentially horsepower, is a function of how you design your jobs, and it's also a function of what type of jobs -- what conventional type of jobs you are replacing, right? So that's one thing. But I think to your second point, it is clearly an evolving technology. We are putting a lot of effort into the application range of HiWAY, and we are also putting a lot of effort into how we design the jobs to be -- to make it even more impactful in terms of how it can reduce resources and basically provide more production for less. So yes, it is clearly evolving. And I'm actually very optimistic with the traction we are now getting with the customer base. With any new technology, and I would say also maybe in particular in North America land, it takes time to break through and penetrate the market with a new technology. And I think we are starting to get some good traction.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division: Okay. And if I could squeeze a third one in here, please. On the international pricing, the Texas early signs of pricing traction, specifically for Wireline and D&M. This is -- it seems on the surface to be quite similar to the comments that have been made in prior quarters. Can you point to something specific that's changed? Or is it just that we continue to be in this state that it looks imminent?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I think what we said in the earlier quarters is that we expected to see pricing traction towards the end of this year. That's what we said earlier. And what I'm saying this quarter is that we are actually seeing some signs of it. There's really 2 signs I would highlight. First of all, higher demand and higher sales of our high-end technology. So there's a lot more salable technology from basic technology to high end. And secondly, we are also testing pricing on specific contracts, typically smaller contracts, with reasonable success.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. Joining me for today's call, which is being hosted from London, are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Operating Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's comments, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results, then Paal will provide an overview of the operational results and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges, was $0.87 per share. This is an increase of $0.16 sequentially and $0.19 compared to the same quarter of last year.  During the quarter, we recorded $0.05 of charges relating to our donation to the Schlumberger Foundation, as well as the continuing integration of Smith and Geoservices. We also recorded a gain of $0.16 per share in discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture of our global connectivity Services business.  Pretax operating income for Oilfield Services, which as a reminder now includes all 3 of our product groups was $1.75 billion. This represents a $295 million sequential increase. Oilfield Services pretax operating income margin improved 155 basis points to 19.5%.  Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by products were as follows: Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.46 billion was 12% higher sequentially and increased 7% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $602 million was 31% higher sequentially and increased 9% year-on-year.  Revenue increased sequentially due mainly to higher WesternGeco Marine proprietary surveys and multiclient sales, and to greater Wireline exploration activity, with a partial recovery from the previous quarter's exceptional weather and geopolitical events.  Increased Schlumberger information solution, SIS software sales also contributed to this performance.  Pretax margin improved 348 basis points sequentially to 24.5%, led by improved WesternGeco Marine utilization, strong Wireline activity and increased software revenue. Drilling Group, second quarter revenue of $3.46 billion was 8% higher sequentially and 127% higher year-on-year. Drilling Group revenue increased sequentially on higher M-I SWACO sales and service activity, and a stronger Drilling & Measurements technology penetration increased pricing and improved job count. Among the drilling technology's sequential increases were boosted by Bits & Advanced Technologies, Drilling Tools & Remedial and PathFinder, as these former Smith product lines provided platform for growth, as drilling intensity and the complexity continue to increase.  Margin for the Drilling Group increased by 98 basis points to 15.6%, primarily due to a very strong performance by M-I SWACO and increased Drilling & Measurements activity.  Second quarter Reservoir Production revenue of $3.06 billion increased 13% sequentially and 47% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $613 million was 16% higher sequentially and increased 146% against last year.  Revenue increased sequentially on higher pricing, significant capacity addition and improved asset utilization for Well Services in North America, but this increase was partially reduced by the effects of the prolonged spring break-up in Canada and adverse weather in the Williston Basin. Internationally, Middle East and Asia revenue grew on Well Services sales, higher stimulation vessel pricing and a stronger activity. Artificial Lift and Completion Systems sales also grew robustly in the second quarter, particularly in Latin America. There's a lot of production margin increased slightly by 57 basis points to 20%, as we experienced revenue improvement across all technologies.  The Distribution business contributed a pretax operating income of $24 million.  Turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges was 24.8% as compared to 23.6% in the first quarter. We still expect the ETR for the full year to be in the mid-20s, reflecting the anticipated mix of activity.  We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion of cash and investments on hand and short-term debt of $3.3 billion. Net debt was $4.3 billion at the end of the quarter as compared to $4 billion at the end of the last quarter.  Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $707 million of stock purchases, $931 million of CapEx and $385 million of proceeds from the divestiture of the Global Connectivity Services business. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.2 million shares at an average price of $86.27 per share. CapEx for all Schlumberger is now expected to approach $4.2 billion in 2011. And now I will turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Oilfield Services second quarter revenue of $8.99 billion grew 11% sequentially and 51% year-on-year. North America had another strong quarter with 11% sequential growth, while margins were up 53 basis points, including the impact of a severe spring break-up in Canada.  Excluding Canada, U.S. sequential revenue growth was 21% while sequential margins were up 287 basis points. These results were driven by both strong pressure pumping and drilling activity.  In Well Services we have, so far this year, added more hydraulic horsepower than in any previous full year. Over the past quarter, we have also made further investments in supply chain and infrastructure in support of these horsepower additions. These investments will further benefit our operating margins in the coming quarters. All our drilling technologies showed strong growth and margin performance, including Drilling & Measurements, PathFinder, M-I SWACO and the former Smith Bits and Smith Services.  In the Gulf of Mexico, all our deepwater startups were conducted flawlessly, and we also started a new multiclient seismic survey using our latest Dual Coil Shooting technology.  Pricing continued to strengthen in all groups in North America, with pricing momentum now being led by our Drilling and Wireline segments. In the international markets, revenue grew 11% sequentially, while margins were up 230 basis points to 18.5%, driven by strong performance in all operating areas.  In Latin America, revenue grew 14% sequentially and margins were up 228 basis points based on strong results in Brazil, Venezuela and Columbia. During the quarter, we also saw a significant ramp-up in the number of offshore rigs in Mexico.  In terms of technology, the sequential performance was led by strong exploration activity for WesternGeco and Drilling & Measurements and strong sales in M-I SWACO and SIS software products.  In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew 8% sequentially, while margins were up 155 basis points. The results were negatively impacted by our Libya business being shut down for the entire quarter, while we continue to pay our local Libyan employees.  Good progress was made in Algeria where our rig JV, Sahara, now has all rigs operating.  In Sub-Sahara Africa, growth of Guinea exploration remains strong while we are seeing a temporary slowdown in exploration activity in East Africa, which will pick up again in Q4.  North Sea activity was steady, with good exploration activity in both Norway and the U.K. and with startup of the Greenland exploration campaign towards the end of the quarter.  Middle East and Asia recorded sequential revenue growth of 12% while margins were up 300 basis points. The results were led by strong activity in the Saudi Arabia, Iraq and East Asia, while we also saw a positive impact on several countries as we recovered from the geopolitical and weather events of the previous quarter.  In Saudi Arabia, the announced ramp up in activity is progressing on schedule and will continue in the second half of the year.  In Iraq, our position continue to strengthen during the quarter in terms of capacity and infrastructure. All projects we are involved in are progressing on plan and we continue to set new drilling records in our IPM Well Construction operations.  In the second quarter, Iraq revenue was already north of $100 million, and exit margins were approaching the average of our Middle East and Asia operating area.  Let me then turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. The Smith integration continues to progress very well, both in terms of revenue and cost synergies to the point that the transaction this quarter was accretive on an earnings-per-share basis. The results from the Smith segments are driven by the strong position in North America, as well as the rapid expansion of their offering to the international markets, supported by Schlumberger's footprint and infrastructure. The integration of complementary Smith and Schlumberger technologies continues to improve drilling performance for our customers, with the combination of the new PowerDrive Archer rotary-steerable-system and tailor-made Smith Bits, being one example that shows great results. In addition to the progress we are making with the Smith integration, we also further strengthened our drilling position in the Russian land markets this quarter, where we closed the previously announced transaction with Eurasia Drilling. This transaction significantly expands market access for our Drilling products and services to a preferred supplier agreement with one of the largest rig contractors in Western Siberia.  In pressure pumping, the growth of HiWAY continued in the second quarter. We have now successfully deployed this fracturing technology in all of our 4 operating areas, and the results continue to show higher production while using significantly less resources.  So far in 2011, more than 1,200 stages have been pumped globally, saving over 60,000 tons of proppant compared to standard fracturing techniques. In North America, more than 700 stages were pumped in the second quarter and a total of 15 customers have now deployed the technology.  In Reservoir Characterization, our shale reservoir modeling workflow continues to gain traction, both internationally and in North America. This workflow uses seismic logs and cores to establish a subsurface model that is able to predict the variations in shale reservoir quality. This enables our customers to only drill wells in the best part of the shale, and only fracture the parts of the horizontal section with real production potential. This way they can significantly reduce the wasted drilling and completion costs from the brute force approach currently used in the shale developments.  In seismic, we are seeing continued growth in worldwide activity and we believe that this will lead to pricing gains in the second half of this year, as previously predicted. In support of our seismic business, we recently opened a new WesternGeco manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia. This brings the capacity needed to expand deployment of our marine streamers and land systems.  160 fully trained people are already active in the new center that was operational only 9 months after the project was launched.  That concludes my remarks, and I now hand the call over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould: Thank you, Paal, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter results showed strong growth worldwide. All product groups grew at double-digit rates. In North America, a prolonged Canadian spring break-up and cool weather in the northwest were offset by very strong growth in the rest of U.S. land and a significant contribution from deepwater operations as rig count increased, and renewed exploration activity in the Gulf of Mexico led to better multiclient seismic data sales.  Internationally, the trend towards higher deepwater rig counts and higher exploration spending continued. This activity was coupled with a surge in developments and work over activities, producers moved to compensate for reduced Libya barrels and to profit from higher prices. As a result, all groups had standout product lines in the quarter and technology sales showed good progress. Strong advances were made in all technologies linked to deepwater exploration and complex development drilling, including WesternGeco, Drilling & Measurements, M-I SWACO and open-hole Wireline as well as Testing Services. The Drilling Group continued to record strong synergistic revenue with a legacy Smith Bits and Drilling Tool businesses in many areas of the world.  The Reservoir Production, in addition to the strong North American stimulation market, high growth rates were experienced internationally as operators moved to improve production and to test unconventional gas plays in several markets.  Pricing power in North America pressure pumping remained robust. But more importantly, towards the end of the quarter, it became clear that pricing traction for certain other services, particularly those related to Drilling high-risk deepwater plays or other complex developments, was in place both in North America and internationally. This is not yet universal, but a positive trend is in place which should yield results by the end of the year.  In our second quarter outlook, we outlined the key constituents of supply and demand for oil and gas over the next few years and pointed out that absent a further length of the recession, substantial increases in investment will be necessary to maintain an adequate supply cushion in an area of political uncertainty. We anticipated that the international supply response would progressively ramp up over the second half of 2011. It transpired that the international ramp-up made a strong start in the second quarter that will continue through the rest of the year and into 2012.  The continued strength in drilling liquid-rich plays in North America, coupled with an acceleration in drilling both in exploration and development internationally, will put considerable strain on the ability of the service industry to meet activity levels. While it is not unprecedented that the North American cycle has run concurrently with the increasing activity internationally, the service intensity of drilling and completing horizontal wells in liquid-rich plays and shale gas basins has introduced the new dynamic inasmuch as this activity requires far more service equipment than was traditionally used in the North American land market. As a result, the ability of the industry to supply both North American and international markets with the required equipment and people in a concurrent growth phase will be challenged.  Schlumberger, through our size, geographical coverage, multinational workforce, comprehensive product and service portfolio and technology capability is uniquely placed to help our customers meet these challenges worldwide. Thank you very much, and I will now hand the call over for the question-and-answer session. Greg?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question in queue will come from James West with Barclays Capital.
James West - Barclays Capital: Andrew, you've made some pretty positive comments on Iraq to the press recently. And of course, Paal you made some very positive comments as well here in your prepared remarks. I was curious as to the trajectory of growth from today's levels that you see in the top line. And then with respect to margins, really, I was deeply impressed with the margin side there. How have you been able to improve your margin so quickly when most of your competition has really struggled in profitability in Iraq?
Andrew Gould: James, I'll now let Paal answer that, okay?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay. So on the top line, I think our outlook is very positive. I think we expect to see a continued ramp in activity throughout the rest of this year and into next year. Just to give you some context, the way it's shaping up for this year. Iraq is likely to be the seventh biggest GeoMarket in the Middle East and Asia operating area, that's out of a total of 14. And in 2012, we expect this to be #3. Now in terms of margins, like I said, the exit margins at the end of this quarter were quickly approaching the average on the Middle East and Asia operating area. And there's a couple of things that I think that are key to this. Firstly, we have been very good in picking up the right type of contracts. In the contracts we have, we have been very careful what kind of liabilities we have been prepared to take on. That meant that we didn't win some of the contracts, but the ones that we have we are quite happy with. And I think we are doing quite a good job for our customers in those as well. We've also, I think, been quite good at tailoring the amount of resources we have in-country to what we need to operate effectively. And thirdly, really the main driver that we have recently now is that we are significantly beating the initial drilling targets in terms of time for the IPM projects that we have. We have more than half the average time it takes us to drill these wells. And obviously, when you are compensated on a turnkey basis, that obviously helps drive your margins.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay, that's very clear and very helpful. Maybe a broader question around the Middle East as a whole. I think last quarter I asked a question, had there been a response from other countries outside of Saudi Arabia to the Saudi's ramp-up that's now clearly underway. Three months later, have you seen other countries really step up or announce plans to step up their activity.
Andrew Gould: We've seen plans announced. But I would argue that no, none of the other countries are executing with the speed of Saudi. So yes, it's going to come, but it's not there yet, James.
Operator: And the next question in queue that will come from the line of Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: So Andrew, back a few months ago, you had referenced then in varying types of questions that it would take -- it's be hard to see another type of inflection, let's say, in the international cycle relative to the '05, '08 period because you're not going to get 100 rig increment out of Saudi. The prepared comments in the press release today in some ways kind of suggests that the deflection -- inflection is now upon us. What do you expect in terms of the sustainability, this cycle? Do you think it's something that could play out over a 3 to 5-year period? And once again, let's take out the macro elements here. And then secondly, how would you characterize Schlumberger's positioning and differential positioning to benefit in this cycle compared to its peers?
Andrew Gould: Well, I mean, I think that to the extent that the liquid-rich plays is extended in the U.S., I'm not going to comment on gas because I really don't quite understand how the gas rig count's going to work out. I think that what a pricing inflection point could be created just by the fact you have 2 concurrent cycles, one overseas and one in North America. Now the second thing, this distinguishing factor of Schlumberger is Reservoir Characterization. It was very clear in this quarter that an acceleration in the exploration cycle is such that, that is going to be a distinguishing part of the company. And if we look at the level of demand for seismic over the last few months and the global demand for seismic, coupled with some form of return in the Gulf of Mexico and there have been encouraging noises out of Washington about holding a lease sale, that makes the seismic business look a lot better than it did even 3 months ago. And the second thing is that, there have never been so many deepwater rigs on order. So to the extent that we have exploration success in deepwater, and there's no reason to believe we won't have reasonable success, I think that the exploration cycle can be a lot more sustained than it was last time when it was abruptly terminated by the financial crisis and by the Macondo incident. So I think that's the first thing. And the second thing, as I've said forever, a long, long time, ever since I took over, to renew the production base when we're close to 90 million barrels a day is just going to take a lot more CapEx than it did -- and OpEx, by the way, than it did when the world was at even 80 million. So to the extent that, as you say, if you exclude the macroeconomic risks which are not inconsiderable at this point in time, I'm back to my sort of theme of stronger for longer.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And then I would maybe just follow up on ultimately the pricing is going to be [indiscernible] maybe again in more detail, but on the seismic front, Paal, you talked about 21% revenue growth in the U.S. market on a sequential basis. Is that just for the U.S. land business or did that 21% also include the seismic?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, that's the total. But if you look at the impact of seismic this quarter, it was not really significant.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So my first question, though, goes back to the U.S., the Gulf of Mexico. You sounded a little bit more upbeat than what I had expected when it comes to the near-term outlook for the Gulf. Could you talk a little bit about what you expect in terms of just the permitting cycle?
Andrew Gould: Well, we're not -- I don't think we're really that different from what other people have been saying on the permitting cycle. But the difference for us is going to be seismic, Ole, because I'm sure you saw [Michael] Bromwich's statement last week about oil -- firstly, the western Gulf which is not great lease sale being held, either at the very end of this year or the very beginning of next, and central and eastern Gulf lease sale being held in the first half of next year. And given the investment we've made in really leading-edge subsalt for multiclient surveys using a lot of our full [ph] technology, that will be very positive for us. So I think the difference is seismic.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay. When it comes to the permitting, do you expect a little bit of a lull here or do you see a recovery? How do you see it panning out?
Andrew Gould: Paal?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. Well, if you look at the current rate, it is relatively slow. But I think as Andrew was alluding to, I think if you linked the fact that there is indications from Washington that the lease sale is going to go ahead, I think we are relatively optimistic that the permitting will speed up to make sure that the ramp-up of rig activity that we have or that we are seeing, or at least we are seeing plans of, is going to be or able to be sustained.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Andrew, on a prior call, you made a reference to announcements of pricing strategies by certain market participants, can you give us an update to what you're seeing right now?
Andrew Gould: I think it's slowing down. I also think that it's not -- the consequence is not as surprising as poor service quality. And last quarter, we gave a number of people that we replaced. And this quarter in our Drilling segment, we replaced our competition 47x. We were replaced 10x, and 8x out of 10x, we were replaced because of lack of equipment not service quality. So I think that the rhythm of nonsense pricing is slowing, but it's not entirely over.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Well, was it mainly your large global players that you replaced or was it situations we're, let's say, [indiscernible]?
Andrew Gould: No. It's mainly the large players. Mainly the large global players. Mainly the large global players, Ole.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay, then. Finally, my last question, Andrew. West Africa, it seems that this year, the Russia, Europe, West Africa is a little slower than what we might have expected, almost difficult to gauge given the effect of the sale of the drilling rigs. But West African exploration, you highlighted many times that you're very optimistic about the outlook for West Africa in general, and particularly on deepwater exploration. Can you give us a little bit of an update on what you're seeing at the moment?
Andrew Gould: Well, we're fractionally more optimistic on Nigeria following the election. Gulf of Guinea is still very strong. We see Angola, both exploration and development, starting to increase in the second half year, and East Africa will be quite slow in the third quarter where we can see it picking up quite a lot in the fourth quarter. So it's coming. I know we've said this before, I think, but deepwater West Africa and East Africa, to a certain extent, is coming.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: And to what extent is this a function of whether there's success of results in the region or not?
Andrew Gould: That's irrelevant at the moment. There are 3 wells in the Kwanza this year. If any of them hits a consequential quantity of oil, then we will be revising the forecast upwards. But we -- don't forget that mostly the activity in the next 18 months will be the seismic commitment on the blocks that are awarded.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Crédit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Could we please spend a little bit more time on Russia? Maybe you can help us calibrate the impact of the asset swap. And then perhaps more importantly, how should we think about sort of the second half of the year and into 2012 as opportunities should start to present themselves with Eurasia?
Andrew Gould: Paal?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, so at this stage we are busy integrating the additional drilling and well construction services that we got as part of this transaction, right? So there was a negative impact on revenue in the second quarter at the order of about $30 million or so, a little bit less than that. This is going to continue and gradually get lower over the second half, and we believe that we'll be on par basically in Q1 of next year. But these are not significant numbers in the overall ECA picture, right? But that's basically that we sold off the rigs and then we have to basically get the services integrated before they start having an impact. But we are very positive on the overall activity in Western Siberia, and also the fact that we now have access with the preferred supplier agreement on one of the biggest rig contractors in the market. It's going to give us a significant -- a bigger footprint for the products and services that we had at Schlumberger and they'll be added with Smith, and that we also now add with the Eurasia deal. So I think overall, the outlook on Russia, we are quite bullish on.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Fair enough. Just to stick with the idea, a couple of directions maybe. First, do you anticipate that a lot of it will be done -- a lot of the work won and then executed will be done on some sort of long-term contract basis? Does the nature of the work change, even Western Siberia in some way? And then maybe the second question is how important is the idea of pulling through sort of higher-end services into the mix?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well the deal we have with Eurasia is the 5-year preferred supplier agreement. And for these type of wells, there's a general type of basic work that is the standard on everything. I think it's going to be a significant opportunity to introduce and deploy higher-end technology that we use other places in the world into this as well, with the type of rigs that Eurasia are drilling also has. So I think there is an opportunity to use a very much tailor-made footprint to the Russian market and on top of that, put our high-end technology that can significantly improve efficiency.
Andrew Gould: And if I might just add. On the question of rigs, rig contracts. The model in Russia is of a general contractor. And to the extent that Eurasia can do it, I think that the contracts will be more and more denominated in numbers of wells. So the average duration is likely to extend, compared to what it's been in recent years.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: That was sort of what I was trying to get out, I just didn't ask the question very clearly. I was trying to get at this idea of them owning and controlling a little bit more of the operations, which I suppose feeds both longer work and technology.
Andrew Gould: The rig is the general contractor, you're quite right, Brad.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Right, so might that become more visible or more public as a result if we're [indiscernible].
Andrew Gould: I very much doubt it. I mean, when you say more public, you're referring to -- make sure that the rig count in Western Siberia is, to say the least, a difficult thing to account for.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Fair enough. If I may, an unrelated follow-up. Smith integration has clearly gone consistently better than you were sort of forecasting prior, right? But as we think about purely from a cost savings and a cost integration basis, is there more to come on that score?
Paal Kibsgaard: If you look at the overall deal, it was primarily a revenue synergy deal, right? There were just some opportunity to reduce costs linked to corporate structure, supply chain and some of the supporting infrastructure. So we are on track with the costs during this year. There's more cost to come obviously in the second half of the year into next year. But I think the overshadowing part of the, I would say overperformance here is down to the revenue synergies. And that's partly down to the technical synergies of bringing together all parts of the BHA, but also that we are able to relatively quickly transport a lot of the Smith portfolio into the international markets and gain share there relatively quickly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JP Morgan.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: Andrew, I love asking a big picture question, so I guess I'll take my last opportunity here. I guess there's some debate out there just with the IEA oil release event activity levels in both the near term and the long term out there. But I get the sense it hasn't really had any impact on Saudi's near-term plans. I was just wondering if it gave any of your IOC customers any pause regarding the direction of oil prices, or is this totally irrelevant, and really the real message out there to the market is very bullish and that the developed countries really don't have the confidence that OPEC's true x [ph] has capacity there?
Andrew Gould: I would go with your last analysis. I think it was a meaningless exercise. I heard some really strange explanations as to why it was actually done. But the underlying signal that went to everybody was that the developed nations are worried about the availability of supply, long term. And to think that, that quantity of product could really make a difference to the oil price I think was very -- a little bit of a panicky move.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: So from your advantage, was there any NOC reaction to this at all? Or is it just kind of business as usual and they effectively ignored it?
Andrew Gould: I think they effectively ignored it.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: Okay. On a different subject, the Reservoir Characterization group showed some very strong sequential margin improvement. However, North American region didn't. And I get a good part of that was Canada. But at the same time, in WesternGeco was said that they're the big contributor from the Gulf. Would have thought that Geco margins would have shown a fairly big margin improvement this quarter? Was that the case? Because we don't have the visibility there anymore.
Paal Kibsgaard: Sorry, let me get it. The multiclient in the Gulf was better than what we'd normally expect in the second quarter of the year. It was not a huge contributor to the sequential growth in North America. But what was significant was multiclient was a significant contributor higher than normally in the second quarter in other parts of the world, Australia, North Sea, West Africa. So there was a much higher level of international multiclient than we normally would expect in the second quarter of the year. But it was not a defining fact in North America progression. It was just a nice to have.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: Okay, understood. Your customer base on the multiclient, internationally, I think it's always been kind of a little bit more on the independent side on the U.S., how does that change internationally, in terms of kind of who that customer mix is?
Andrew Gould: I think the larger players -- actually, by the way, I think that the argument that multiclient is purely an independent business is being somewhat weakened through the fact that a lot of the multiclient we do, we employ totally unique technologies. And therefore, we have IOC buyers just as much as we have independent buyers. Now generally overseas, I would say that pretty much everyone buys multiclient. It's not just the independent. The question in the overseas is normally the block sizes are so big, the number of players is much smaller and therefore, it's much harder to choose a multiclient target survey that's going to have general appeal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: On seismic, Paal, I guess a question for you. If I think about the market getting tighter, pricing getting better, I guess 2 questions. One, within the context of pricing getting better, how much of that do you think is really the technology versus just industry inflation and tightness of utilization. And then I guess secondly is a follow-on to Andrew's comment that perhaps the multiclient outlook looks a little bit better than we thought 3 or 4 months ago. Does it change anything on the capital side in terms of converting gunboats back into streamers or even adding vessels?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay, on the first question which is you're asking how much is done through technology and how much is just straight capacity? I think on the technology side, we are obviously using a significant amount of our technology in the multiclient, and that's how we can, for sure, deploy it. So I would say that the main price driver at this stage in the market is going to be tight capacity. But also, we are seeing very good applications for our high-end technology both in the third-party market, but even more so on the multiclient. But generally, it's the capacity constraint that's going to initially drive pricing. On the capital plans, I think the main thing for us is that in the Marine seismic gain, utilization is everything. So we are currently running at very good utilization and that's the key driver for our profitability. So if we see opportunities to add or reconvert back streamer vessels that are currently used as source boats and maintain our utilization well into the 90s, we will do that. But we will be opportunistic on that and look at doing that at the right time. But we have clearly the capacity to do that whenever we choose to.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: So it's premature, relative to your thoughts back at the Analyst Meeting in February to say that the seismic market has gotten to the point where you would consider that?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think we are looking at this on a monthly or quarterly basis, right? So I would say that the first thing now is that you need to get supply to meet demand, and we are getting close to doing that in terms of 3D vessels. When that is getting close, we have built in capacity to our fleet to at least handle a capacity addition for another year before we need to look at new builds and so forth.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Okay, great. And then last one for me. Andrew, if I think about international growth, you mentioned exploration activity obviously and sort of simultaneous development. A lot of exploration is offshore. The onshore conventional side -- or rather the onshore side, how much do you think the unconventional is going to contribute to growth over the next 2 to 3 years on the onshore side?
Andrew Gould: Across the global international CapEx budget, I think the contribution -- did you mean by unconventional, shale?
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Yes.
Andrew Gould: As opposed to tight...
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: As opposed to, well, let's call it all unconventional, because I know CBM is a big piece as well. So tight CBM and shale...
Andrew Gould: Then I think the countries where it's going to happen are limited. So China, Poland, Argentina, Australia, maybe a little bit of India, I don't know. It's not on the scale of the complete international CapEx budget enough to move the needle. Now what it is, Michael, is what I tried to point out in the commentary, is where it does happen, it absorbs a huge amount of equipment. So, I mean, I don't think in the next 2 or 3 years it's enough to shift the needle. Particularly as overseas as Paal explained in his comments, they cannot take a statistical approach to it. They have to do some qualification of the reservoir, because they don't have the same knowledge of the shale, however poor that may be, as you do in the U.S.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: So science first, a lot of Reservoir Characterization work?
Andrew Gould: Well I think they have to, yes. They have to do it. They can't do it any other way. I mean, that's very obviously the case in Poland, for example.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Right. So having about Schlumberger impact on Schlumberger, the Reservoir Characterization side, the geoscience side, it's going to show up before, really, the rig volume starts to show up?
Andrew Gould: Yes. I shall be watching with interest as they implement the characterization workflow, Michael.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Andrew, on the international pricing. For the inflection to truly be upon us or to be universal as you stated in your press release, do you think that we need to see both the end of nonsense or nonsensical pricing and greater evidence of tangible activity growth in both West Africa and Southeast Asia?
Paal Kibsgaard: Angie as activity goes up, customers become more and more concerned about the quality of service delivery and less and less concerned about the cost. This is why technology sales are improving right now. So I think that you don't have to wait for an inflection point to get rid of nonsense pricing. I think it's going to go away quite naturally. What was the second part of your question?
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: And then do we need to see both West Africa growth -- I mean, tangible activity growth in West Africa and Southeast Asia?
Andrew Gould: It's not [indiscernible]. Don't forget, the principal driver of deep water activity is still Brazil. But if you get a combination of Brazil, West Africa and a reasonable level of permits in the Gulf of Mexico and some of the projects in Australia getting sanctioned, it's going to get very tight. Yes.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Yes, okay. Fair enough. And then also, given the tax changes in the U.K., North Sea, what is your outlook in the region next year? Could activity be down modestly, flat or potentially more material? And then also, on that tax changes in Russia, does it imply incremental activity next year?
Andrew Gould: Well on Russia, I think the answer is yes, it does. And in the North Sea, this year we certainly haven't noticed any effect on activity of the tax change in the U.K. And yes, I think it could have an effect next year, but I also think that there will be considerably more longer discussions between the transfer and this sector in the oil industry before next year comes around.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: All right. And then finally, on the Framo acquisition and the purchasing of the remaining 47%. I believe Framo is the only, I guess, true competitor of SMC in subsea boosting. So what's the strategy for owning the company? And are there other complementary subsea businesses that you'd be interested in?
Andrew Gould: I think if you look out to Framo, we have been involved with them for over 10 years. We previously held 52% of the shares of the company and we got the opportunity to buy the remaining part, and we took the opportunity. It's obviously a very well positioned company, in terms of their leadership in subsea and boosting, which we find interesting. But beyond that, we took the opportunity to buy out the other owners.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: All right. So no other business that you're interested in, in conjunction on subsea?
Paal Kibsgaard: Not at this stage, no.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Paal, I'm a little bit unclear with regard to the pricing commentary on seismic. You said pricing improving second half of this year, does that mean for marine contract engagements commencing next year, in terms of tendering activity taking place second half of this year or is it realized pricing?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, it will be the contract that we are bidding for. Now that could be for next season, meaning 6 or 9 months away. Or they could be 2 or 3 months away from the spot market as well. So I think we are seeing early signs -- we saw early signs now in Q2 or in some isolated market, and we believe that the bid pricing that we are submitting, that's what's going to be giving us this pricing traction in the second half of the year. And some of these bids are relatively short term, which means they could be implemented in the second half and some of them could be spilling into 2012 as well.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International: And from a marine contract standpoint, where are you seeing the most pronounced vigor and appetite and sort of potential pricing inflection? Which regions?
Paal Kibsgaard: We see strength in marine activity actually worldwide. We just have to continue into 2012. So that's the North Sea, the Bering Sea, Angola, Brazil, Asia, Australia. So it's obviously with the -- if the lease sale, when the lease sale is announced in the Gulf of Mexico, that's going to draw a significant amount of multiclient activity back into the Gulf, which there is going to give some pricing traction. But also that's going to have a spill-on effect back to the places that I just referred to.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Got it. So we shouldn't read too much into the fact that WesternGeco's backlog was actually down quarter-on-quarter?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I wouldn't read anything into that.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. Secondly, with regard to a couple of sort of regional markets. Manifa, Paal, are you willing to share one, what the well costs are there that you are drilling? And two, where your current rig count is and what the targeted rig count is going to be?
Paal Kibsgaard: So in terms of the well cost, I'm not able to share that. I don't have the exact number of the rig count that we own now. The main thing that is clear is that for the Manifa project, the rig counts are going up. They started to go up this quarter, they will continue to go up in the second half of the year. A significant part of the increase is going to be on the land rigs or the rigs on the causeway, yes, it's the contract that we hold. And these are the high intensity or complex ERD wells. So in that sense, our activity outlook for Saudi Arabia is very positive on that basis.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. And then lastly for me, Mexico, any updated observations here with regard to the outlook there, please?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes, so on the land side, we shut down the Burgos project, as planned, in the second quarter. The IPM project, Mesozoic [indiscernible] continues with the recount that we have then are pretty stable. The production management contracts or the production incentive contracts are currently out, the 60s that are out for bid. We're going to participate and the submissions are due there in September, so that will be an interesting business model to try out in Mexico. We saw a significant ramp-up in offshore activity during the second quarter. And this is the shallow water offshore activity. And that ramp-up of rigs is actually set to continue into H2. So we're quite upbeat on the offshore part of Mexico, as well it's going to be very interesting to see how these production incentive contracts pan out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Just wanted to follow up as it relates to the revenue and margin improvement we saw sequentially in the Eastern Hemisphere 2Q. Is that mostly just a snapback as you guys see it from the seasonal declines in the first quarter? Or have we started to see some of the improving operating fundamentals really creep into the results yet, I guess, my first question? And second, given the pricing and mixing outlook, I think expectation has been kind of a back half of '11 to be more of a volume-led margin expansion story. I'm just curious if there's anything that you guys see in the Eastern Hemisphere as far as a sharper margin inflection in the back half of the year, or is that still pretty much a 2012 story.
Andrew Gould: I think I was quite clear in the commentary that we -- it's not general yet, but individually, on small contracts, pricing improvements have begun. And I think that I don't see any reason why that would go away now, Bill. Now there is a snapback effect partly in EMEA, of Australia and Egypt, but it's not significant in the overall picture. And yes, you have definite activity pickup. And what I would point out to you, we pointed out at the beginning, is that a lot of the pickup was in characterization, and therefore that tells you that a lot of the pickup is beginning at some of these exploration campaigns that we've been waiting for.
Paal Kibsgaard: And maybe just adding to that, I agree with what Andrew is saying. I think that if you look at the sequential margins overseas, there's really 2 main components, one is that the volume is actually going up. And the way we are set up with our and our infrastructure, we are actually able to leverage the volume and the fixed costs we have to generate good fall-through even on a relatively flat pricing, right? That's #1. And #2, as Andrew alluded to, the part of the company that grew very well was the Reservoir Characterization where the average margins are obviously higher than for the other 2 product groups.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Sure. My one follow-up would be, given the pricing outlook here, internationally typically it's been more of a longer-term contracting type market. I'm just curious, is there an opportunity as you saw in incremental contracts, to structure these in more shorter term-type periods to generate more leverage for yourself in capturing this pricing inflection? Or is this still going to be a market dominated by longer-term contracts and that kind of uplifts based on up-selling and technology additions?
Simon Ayat: It's more of the latter.
Andrew Gould: Yes, it's more of the latter. Generally, these contracts have one fixed term and then options for our customers to take several, right? So I think the way they bid it is basically up to them and that [indiscernible]. So I think there's going to be a major change to how the contracting is done.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandall from Dahlman Rose.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC: Andrew, I'm going to ask you to look backwards and look forwards, what are you most proud of, of your accomplishments over the last 9 years? And what do you think the biggest challenges for Paal are going forward?
Andrew Gould: I don't think I can single out any particular achievement I'm more proud of that others. I think if I am going to single out anything, it's the quality of the management team and the depth of the management team, not just the first and second level, but even the third and fourth level that I'm leaving behind. It's a people business. And I think that Paal has -- Paal and I have been discussing this for a long time and it was quite conscious that we did the Smith acquisition 18 months before I retired, so he didn't have to worry too much about a strategic M&A for the first few years. He can just execute. And I think that given the state we're in, in the cycle, provided the economies hold together, he can -- the capacity to execute will be fundamental to the company's growth and results for the next 2 or 3 years.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC: In past cycles, it seems to me as you look back, Andrew, one of the primary ways of improving international margins, particularly in reservoir valuation was to introduce new technology at higher price points. Do you expect that to be a driver at this cycle, and do you think that over the next 12 months that there should be a heavy period of new tool upgrades and introductions into the markets?
Paal Kibsgaard: So as we pointed out in Boston in February, this year is a better year than last year. And so far, the key introductions that we've made this year are going good. But as we also pointed out in Boston, 2012 should be a much stronger year for new introductions than 2011. And a lot of the introductions, not necessarily all in reservoir evaluation ought to do with drilling efficiencies, and a lot of them are the results of the Smith acquisition. And in a high activity market, drilling efficiency is worth an awful lot of money to our customers so I'm quite confident that, that will play a major part in the next cycle as well.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC: Okay. One final question, many of your big competitors are adding frac equipment in North America as quickly as they can. How would you say your equipment-adding strategy differs from them?
Andrew Gould: I don't think it does, but I'll let Paal comment on that.
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I think we, well, we generally believe that there is opportunity to bring service intensity down from this brute force approach we have to share development. We are still pursuing both sides of the equation there. And so while we continue to promote the workflow that I alluded to in my comment, we are also adding significant horsepower this year into our Pressure Pumping business. So as I mentioned in my commentary, we added in the first half of this year, more horsepower than we've done in any full year previously. And I think that just basically signals that we are part of this thing as well.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC: And Paal, how significant do you think the whole sliding sleeve technology area will be in the business and what are Schlumberger's plans here?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, we are looking at this technology as well. But I think that there's a few things that this sliding sleeve technology that I think needs to still be clarified, right? I mean, the main thing the sliding sleeve technology does is that it groups several frac stages into one larger stage. It means that all the substages of this larger stage is one hydraulic system. So what it means is that you will need more horsepower, more peak horsepower to frac this mega-stage in one go. So that's only significant for the pressure pumping company and you can also do more jobs within one unit over time. But I think that the jury is out on how the economics are going to look for our customers on this, and also what the impact on production is going to be like. So we are looking at it, but I think it is yet another thing that might add intensity to the whole equation. But I think one of the things we need to look at as an industry is to see how we can get the intensity down and be more succinct in how we pursue these things.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Jeff Keeberts [ph] from Whedon [ph].
Unknown Analyst - : A couple of questions. Multiclient. What percentage over the last 12 months -- what percentage of multiclient is revenues being generated outside of the U.S.?
Andrew Gould: I don't know the answer off the top of my head, Jeff. Do you know it, Simon?
Simon Ayat: You mean over the last...
Paal Kibsgaard: Outside, over the last 12 months, non-Gulf of Mexico.
Unknown Analyst - : Let me give you a choice. 25%, 50% or 75%?
Simon Ayat: It's more -- it's sub-50%. For this quarter, for your information, it's more like 80%. Compared to the North America, yes? It will be 80% of the North America. At last quarter, sorry, if you look at the last quarter, just to add more information, it was 60% of the North America.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay, great. That's helpful.
Simon Ayat: Half the year, we are about 70%.
John Lawrence - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. In terms of bigger picture in the international market. I think you were clear, Andrew in regards to the tone. It's gotten materially better. Can you point to anything in particular that has caused that to happen over the last 3 months?
Andrew Gould: In terms of the international market, Jeff?
Unknown Analyst - : Yes.
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think just the obvious ones, like Iraq and Saudi. And then there's the less obvious ones is North Sea, which has done better, I think, than we originally thought. And then I would say that the, perhaps one of the biggest surprises is East Asia where an awful lot of activity has been directed towards improving production at higher oil prices. And frankly, it may not be the opinion of Paal, but I'm surprised -- I knew Latin America would be strong, but I'm quite surprised how strong it is, because it's not just Brazil.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. And then just to clarify in Saudi and Iraq, obviously they're strong, but are they materially stronger than what you were expecting?
Andrew Gould: Well, obviously, Saudi is. And of course the other thing that's really nice in Saudi is when they go into production enhancement or work over to increase production, it generates very high volumes very quickly.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. Well that was kind of my related question, as you talk about pricing leverage, a little bit of a variant on the question about seismic earlier. Is that pricing leverage that's going -- that's being reflected in contracts you're signing right now that will appear to us 2, 3 quarters from now? Or is it...
Andrew Gould: Yes, the question is going to be whether or not to really allow you guys to see it. In other words, as I said earlier on, it's on the small contracts, at the moment, that we get leverage, not on the big ones.
Unknown Analyst - : Got you. Okay. And shifting to North America, since I'm the last question I get to go for longer. What percentage of your frac horsepower is on 24/7 operations in the U.S. today?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don't have a number for you on that, but I mean we are continuing to convert the 12-hour cruise into 24 hours. But I don't have the number for you. And maybe Malcolm can come back to you.
Unknown Analyst - : Do you think it's anywhere close to 50%?
Paal Kibsgaard: I don't think it's 50%. It's sub-50% for sure.
Unknown Analyst - : And rising, though?
Paal Kibsgaard: And rising, yes.
Unknown Analyst - : And then in terms of your comment, Paal, about the pricing momentum in the North American market is now greater for D&M and Wireline than pressure pumping. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit there that's, I think, somewhat surprising?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well I would just say, I mean, it still doesn't mean that we don't have pricing momentum on pressure pumping. It's just that the other services, which is actually quite a significant part of our portfolio in North America, is starting to show some very nice contribution to the overall picture as well, in terms of moving margin and also contributing to growth. So we have a very strong position on both the drilling side, and to a certain extent on Wireline on land, but obviously, very much offshore. And these things are now starting to make significant contribution as well, in terms of the quarter-to-quarter momentum.
Unknown Analyst - : If we were to just focus on the land market, would that statement still be true?
Paal Kibsgaard: For drilling, yes.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Operating Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being hosted from Rio de Janeiro where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting is being held in our Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center. Prior to Andrew's comments, Simon will first review the quarter’s financial results and then Paul will provide an overview of the operational results and technical highlights. Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter EPS, excluding charges, was $0.71 per share. This is a decrease of $0.14 sequentially and an increase of $0.09 compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $0.02 of charges relating to the continuing integration of Smith and Geoservices. As we previously announced, the quarter's results when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 were adversely impacted by a number of events. The events included severe weather in North America and Australia, political disturbances in the Middle East and North Africa, and the absence of the Q4 early payout of the IPM gain share project in North America, as well as the traditional surge in year-end multi-client software and other product sales. These items more than accounted for the sequential decreases in the EPS. This is the first quarter that we are reporting under our new group structure. As a reminder, our primary reporting was based on our 3 groups: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Reservoir Production. These 3 groups comprise what we will now refer to as Oilfield Services. In addition, we will report our Distribution business as a separate and distinct segment. From now on, when we refer to the results of our geographic areas, it reflects the results of all 3 of the groups, including the legacy Smith oilfield and M-I SWACO businesses. Furthermore, the results of WesternGeco are also now included in both the group and geographic results and are no longer reported separately. This is a significant change from our prior quarters that I wanted to highlight. It is also worth pointing out that the Distribution business, which predominantly North-American centric, is not included in the geographic results. All prior period amounts that I will mention have been restated to conform to our new structure. Pretax operating income for Oilfield Services were $1.5 billion. This represents $240 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Oilfield Services pretax operating margin fell 206 basis points to 17.9%. International pretax operating margins were 16.5% for the quarter. Again, the previously mentioned events were the primary drivers underlying this performance.  From a group perspective, Reservoir Characterization margin fell 606 basis points to 21%. As the severe weather and political disturbances significantly hampered Wireline activity, while the absence of the year-end WesternGeco market line and the SIS software sales negatively impacted margins on a sequential basis. Margins for the Drilling group improved slightly to 14.6% on strong performances from IPM Well Construction activity and the number of the acquired Smith businesses in spite of the weather and geopolitical issues. Reservoir Production margin decreased 145 basis points to 19.4% due to the absence of the year-end product sales in Artificial Lift and Completion and the Q4 early payout of the IPM gain share project, as well as the impact of the weather in North America land. Distribution contributed pretax operating income of $22 million. On a geographic perspective, North America had a very strong quarter, driven by Well Services activity and pricing. As a result, margin increased by 32 basis points despite the absence of the Q4 IPM gain share payout, which accounted for approximately 1.4 percentage points of margin last quarter and the lower multi-client sales. Latin America margin increased by 78 basis points to 15.7% as the revenue mix strengthened. Europe/CIS/Africa margin decreased by 6 percentage points to 12.5%. This decrease largely reflect the impact of the political disturbances in Libya and Tunisia, combined with a less favorable revenue mix in Russia and the seasonality effects in the North Sea. Middle East and Asia margins dipped slightly by 145 basis points to 21.9%. This decrease is almost entirely due to the political events in the area and the weather effects in Australia. The impact of the year-end product and software sales also contributed to the decline.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges, was 23.6% as compared to 23.1% in the fourth quarter. We still expect the ETR for the full year to be in the mid-20s, reflecting the planned mix of activity between North America and the rest of the world. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash and investment and short-term debt of $2.2 billion. Net debt was $4 billion at the end of the quarter as compared to $2.6 billion at the end of last quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $844 million of stock repurchases and $769 million of CapEx. During the quarter, we repurchased 9.68 million shares at an average price of $87.18 per share. Additionally, we have now completed the refinancing of all of the long-term fixed-rate debt we assumed in the Smith transaction. In this regard, we repurchased $1.3 billion of notes during the quarter. This refinancing will serve to reduce our interest expense going forward. CapEx for all the Schlumberger is still expected to approach $4 billion in 2011.  And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard: Thank you, Simon. Schlumberger first quarter revenue of $8.12 billion decreased 4% sequentially, but increased 45% year-on-year. The impacts of the geopolitical events in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as severe weather in the U.S. and Australia impacted all 3 product groups and represented around half of the sequential decrease in total Oilfield Services revenue.  Looking at the product groups, Reservoir Characterization sequential revenue was severely impacted by the geopolitical events at WesternGeco Q-Land, Testing Services and our Wireline activity the most. In addition to this, WesternGeco revenue decreased following the fourth quarter surge and multi-client sales in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico even though revenue increased in Marine due to a more favorable activity mix. SIS revenues fell sharply in all areas from seasonally lower software sales. Casting revenue also fell due to less product sales, lower activity in Latin America and East Asia and due to the winter slowdown in Russia. Wireline revenue was flat sequentially as strong winter activity in Canada offset the impact of the geopolitical and weather events. For the Drilling group, the sequential drop in revenue was primarily caused by the geopolitical events and excluding this impact, revenue actually increased for the group. IPM Well Construction revenue increased on strong activity growth in Iraq, Mexico and Russia. Drilling and Measurements revenue decreased from lower activity and pricing in Europe, CIS and Africa and the completion of offshore exploration project in Australia, Papua New Guinea, but this was partly offset by the return of some deep water work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and by an increase in activity in Latin America and Russia. M-I SWACO show continued strong activity in North America, but overall, revenue decreased due to seasonally lower product sales, the weather in Australia and delayed projects in Europe, CIS and Africa. In Reservoir Production, revenue fell sequentially largely due to the impact of the geopolitical events in North Africa and the Middle East, and due to severe weather in the U.S. and in Australia. Excluding these impacts, the production group revenue increased as higher pricing and strong demand for Well Services technologies in North America more than offset the IPM gain share payout in North America from the prior quarter and the seasonally lower product sales in Artificial Lift and Completion Systems. From a geographical perspective, the Europe/CIS/Africa revenues decreased sequentially as a result of the political unrest in North Africa, a less favorable revenue mix, lower software sales in the North Sea GeoMarkets and seasonally lower activity in Russia. Middle East and Asia revenue was lower as increasing IPM activity in Iraq and shale gas activity in India were insufficient to offset the impact of geopolitical events in the Middle East, seasonally lower software and product sales and weather-related slowdown in Australia. In North America, excellent growth in pricing, utilization and activity in our Well Services product line resulted in double-digit sequential revenue growth, which fully offset lower WesternGeco multi-client sales, the non-recurrence of the IPM gain share payout and the impact of weather-related slowdown on land in the U.S. In Latin America, strong growth in WesternGeco and M-I SWACO activity in the Brazil GeoMarket balanced lower offshore activity and lower software sales in the Mexico and Central America GeoMarket. Looking at some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to start off with WesternGeco where a number of contract awards in Marine emphasize the success of new technology, both in acquisitions and in processing. Market take off of Coil Shooting acquisition with successful completion of the survey offshore Brazil and the award of a new Coil survey in Angola were particularly notable. The opening of the Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center in Brazil will be key to the processing of the Brazil data, while centers such as the WesternGeco GeoSolutions center in Jakarta will underline other contracts that have recently been awarded. For the growth in exploration activity to come, WesternGeco is well placed through technology and footprint to make further progress in the coming quarters. In the Drilling group, we continued to make significant progress in terms of integration and synergies between Smith and Schlumberger products and services to the point that we now see the transaction being neutral on an earnings per share basis in Q2 2011, moving up from our previous estimate of H2 2011. In addition to revenue synergies related to our global footprint, as well as our IPM and D&M businesses, we are also starting to see the first examples of revenue synergies related to new product development. As a result, Smith Bits continues to perform very well, keeping its leadership position in the roller-cone market while at the same time dramatically improving the PBT market share, both in international and North American markets. This position is further strengthened by the introduction of the new Spear bits that's bringing superior performance to our customers operating any unconventional shale basins. We have also recently introduced another new bit, based on our unique single-copper technology developed by our nominal drill division in Utah, which has shown up to 80% improvement in drilling rates as well significant reductions in shock and vibration.  At our Investor Conference in February, we discussed the new HiWAY fracture stimulation technology, and this service continues to see very rapid growth. Total job count is now approaching 1,000 with 528 stages completed in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 102 in the fourth quarter of 2010. The first horizontal open hole well in the Bakken Shale with a total of 19 stages has been successfully completed using HiWAY and the first job has also been conducted in the Middle East. A significant number of opportunities for future jobs are now under evaluation for HiWAY. A new field for HiWAY technology deployment are under discussion in the U.S. and in Canada, Argentina, India, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria, Congo and Angola. In the investor conference, we also told you about the leading position Schlumberger has established in well intervention and production enhancements to our market leading Wireline, slickline and coiled tubing offering. We are currently seeing particularly strong growth in our new coiled tubing service ACTive, which offers real time fiber optic enabled measurements and this new service has already been deployed to 20 GeoMarkets around the world.  Finally, I would like to highlight IPM's outstanding drilling performance on the well construction project in Iraq. All the projects have been mobilized and started on schedule in a very challenging environment, and we are now drilling both for BP and ExxonMobil. On the BP project, we have already managed to half the drilling time from the first well we drilled through the use of both technology and process optimization, and our ability to consistently redefine the benchmark for this performance is being recognized by our customers.  With that, I will pass the call over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould: Thank you, Paal. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Despite the difficult working environment, I'm very pleased to the performance with both our North American and international operations during the quarter where a number of underlying trends were positive.  Wireline growth was encouraging, particularly for high technology services. Despite the seasonal drop in Russia with M-I SWACO, the Drilling group revenue increased to excellent performance at IPM Well Construction, particularly in Iraq. In addition, growth in revenue synergies with Smith and Geoservices products is very strong. Reservoir production continued to make gains in North America in both activity and pricing, which in our total North American results more than compensated for the absence of a gain share project that was recognized in the fourth quarter and a 42% drop in seismic revenues between the fourth and first quarters. These positive effects limited the decrease in margins to 206 basis points, led by strong performance in a number of GeoMarkets, including Iraq, where we achieved double-digit margins that we expect to improve continuously through the end of the year. Looking ahead, the recent completion or announcement of various licensing rounds around the world will ensure sustained marine seismic activity. The anticipated increases in exploration budget and the advent of additional development activity, particularly in the Middle East and North America, will rapidly improve business conditions for Wireline and Testing Services. The continued success of new Petrel releases, particularly for exploration, will ensure further strong performance from SIS.  For Drilling and Measurements however, despite strong increases in demand, service pricing remains extremely competitive internationally but excellent service quality and advanced technology allows this effect to be offset to some degree. In addition, call-out services are non-contracted rates have boosted this effect and further activity increases later in the year should lead to considerable tightening of capacity with a consequent effects on price impact.  The absence of oil production from Libya, combined with continued recovery in demand, has reduced the world's spare capacity of oil production significantly. The call on both fuel oil and natural gas will increase as Japan recovers. The exploration and production industry has begun to respond and absent a further leg to the recession, will have to substantially increase investment to maintain a comfortable supply cushion in an era of political uncertainty. We anticipate that high oil prices will continue to support additional drilling in the liquid-rich plays in North America. The upturn in deepwater activity more generally is becoming increasingly visible, and the rate of permitting in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is accelerating. Middle East activity is increasing substantially, led by Saudi Arabia and Iraq.  These activities will progressively mobilize over the next 6 months and the projected increases will reach levels where some resources will become constrained. Schlumberger is ready for this scenario with new technology, equipment and people. Our excellence in execution initiatives, which were introduced in 2007, is already paying dividends and will continue to do so. Thank you very much. I will now hand the call to Stacy for the question-and-answer session. Stacy?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will go to the line of Dan Boyd with Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Andrew, I'd like to just follow up with you on what's going on in North America and you alluded to this somewhat in your comments with the seismic being down, IPM gaining up being there this quarter. But what are you seeing, especially on land, as underlying sort of revenue and margin trends? Just as we look at what 1 of your competitors put up so far, the numbers look like they maybe growing a little bit faster. So maybe can you talk about what you're seeing there and just update us on your strategy of closing the gap in terms of, I think, size and margin within North America.
Andrew Gould: Okay, Dan. So can we make an extraction of the gain for the IPM project that was sold in Q4 and an extraction for a sequential drop of 43% in seismic revenue. And then I'm going to ask Paal to talk about the rest of our strategy in North America. Is that okay?
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: That would be great.
Andrew Gould: Okay. Paal?
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay, so if you look at what we set out to do about some months ago, we set up the goal to basically close the margin gap in North America because at that stage we were severely underperforming in our eyes. So if you look at where we stand at this stage, we have more or less closed the gap, so I'm very pleased with the margin momentum that we have managed to create. And I'm also quite confident and positive in my outlook of our future margin momentum. If you look at land, we are at this stage seeing a very strong pricing momentum in both Drilling and Wireline, and I think this will continue in the coming quarters. I also think that our HiWAY introduction drilling technology is going to help extend our pressure pumping margin momentum. We're actually seeing some customers switching to our pressure pumping services at this stage at the back of HiWAY. We also continue to drive utilization in all segments as part of the restructuring that we have initiated and we have record utilization again in pressure pumping in March. And also see some impacts that still come from the restructuring in terms of supply chain services, as well as general support. Now in addition to that, we are also relatively optimistic on the onset of the Gulf of Mexico coming back and we have a very strong position in the high-end services, so Wireline and Drilling and Measurements in these new rigs and permits that have been granted. And this, of course, is going to be highly accretive to our non-performance going forward. So that's on the margin side. On the growth, we are very much committed to invest in capacity as we go forward. The quarter-to-quarter growth for Well Services as I indicated in my comments were in double-digits, but they were offset by the significant reduction in multi-client sales, as well as the non-recurring gain share we had then in IPM. So we are very much, I would say, positive on the outlook of North America at this stage. We have secured manufacturing capacity on pressure pumping in a multi-year bid program that we started last year and we have a lot of flexibility in our program to continue to take significant capacity addition, which is what we are going to do.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: That's very helpful. There's a lot I could probably follow up on with that, but let me just go back to the HiWAY and it's something you talked about at your Analyst Day. But how quickly can you build that up and is that something where we could expect you to start pulling through a lot more services and using that to lead with a differentiator? But in terms of scale and how many pressure pumping jobs or how many fleets you could roll it out to, how should we think about the progress that has been made and how quickly that could continue to ramp up?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think we are ramping this up very quickly as you see. There's somewhat the quotations that's needed to be done on the pressure pumping equipment that we have on the wildcard, but this is not significant. So the main thing is just to have the product available to pump and we have, obviously, a significant supply line set up to do this, right? So just in terms of the ramp, we did about 100 stages as I said in Q4 and we did over 500 in Q1. And this is now multiplying almost by the day, right? So we have not only in North America, but we are now engaged in looking at candidates and projects pretty much all over the globe. So this is a significant amount, I would say, growth vehicle for us on pressure pumping. And as I said, even in North America, we've had cases where customers have switched to our pressure pumping services in the background of HiWAY.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And if I could just have 1 more follow up on just the Gulf of Mexico coming back because that's something that Andrew highlighted at the Analyst Day of something we could -- the 1 upside surprise to really tighten even international market, it sounds like you're optimistic there, but is that something that you think contributes to a much higher incremental margins in the back half of the year, just broadly in the business?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I would say so. If you look at our margins in North America historically, the Gulf of Mexico has always been highly accretive to our business. Over the past year, it has been highly dilutive so I think it's going to have a significant relative impact to our margin as we go forward.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Angie Sedita from UBS.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Andrew, in your comments you mentioned that you believe some resources will be constrained as activity increases. Which product lines would you expect would be constrained first? And I would assume it would likely be in some international markets over others, could you give us a little color?
Andrew Gould: I think that if the Gulf of Mexico plays out, Saudi plays out. The new [indiscernible] seem to be coming on a pretty much as we planned them, then the first place that equipment control that will show up will be Drilling and Measurements. In fact, in some places, they're showing up already which makes complete nonsense of the industry's pricing policy at this point in time.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: And on international margins, for the third quarter of 2007, we were at 18.7%. Obviously, increased in Q4 to 19.3% on seasonality and as expected declined here in Q1 to 16.5% for international margins. When you think about the second quarter, could we go back to the third quarter level for international margins at 18.7% or do you see that as a second half of 2011 event?
Andrew Gould: No, I will be disappointed if we don't do that in the second quarter.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. And then finally, there's been some commentary about performance-based contracts for Schlumberger and it's been an area that you're focusing on globally. Could you give us a little color what percentage it is of total revenues today? What could it rise to? What customers you're working for? And is there any risk that this could change the dynamics for peak international margins for the cycle?
Andrew Gould: I'm going to let Paal answer the question on the strategy with performance contracting.
Paal Kibsgaard: Okay, so we have actually been moving our contract base, in particular, within Drilling and Measurements towards performance contract over the past couple of years. And at this stage, we have around 1/3 of our contracts for Drilling and Measurements based on performance in various forms. And this is obviously something that we will continue to push going forward. Exactly how high it will come, I can't give you an exact number on, but again, we are setting quite aggressive goals in terms moving our contracts towards this type of cycle. And the key for that is, that obviously, when you take on a performance-based contract, you need to have confidence in your ability to perform. And at this stage, we are very confident in our ability. And the reason for that is the excellent in execution program that we embarked on 4 years ago where we have basically invested heavily both on the product development side to get better performing products, but also on the operational processes and all of these elements are now paying off very, very nicely.
Andrew Gould: Yes, and if I can provide a little color to that Angie. In Q1, the first quarter of 2011, we replaced our competition in Drilling and Measurements on 40 jobs. They replaced us on 7. Almost all 40 we replaced them on were for service quality review. We were replaced 1 for service quality and 6 times because we didn't have the right tool available. So I was just -- a very nice point that in this international market, as drilling ramps up, quality is really going to count.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: So is there a specific customer that you're working, is this more NOCs in international oil companies or give us little color there?
Andrew Gould: I think it's across the board at the moment.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, great. Well, thanks, guys.
Operator: I'm going to the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: A question to Paal or for Simon Ayat there, you didn't highlight any of sort of magnitude of the negative headwinds in the first quarter. That's where it's somewhat unusual, Australia, North Africa, I mean we all know, this was a very unusual quarter. Could you give us not enough, with respect to North America, but with respect to international, could you help us with some kind of magnitude of the negative effect versus kind of a normalized type of core environment? I mean, we all know that there's no such thing as normalized but nevertheless, could you help us a little bit?
Simon Ayat: So Ole, as we announced before, this impact of geopolitical and weather, overall impacted us between $0.08 to $0.10, will probably be more on the lower end of that. And this is what happened in the first quarter, some of it is North America, it's only the weather impact of it is North America, but the rest is international. So we are in that range that we announced, partly, it's North America, but the large part of this is international because of the geopolitical and the Australia weather, the severe weather we experienced in Q1. Does this answer your question?
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Yes. So if you look at the margin impact from there, say your international, so would this be -- so in percentage terms, on the international margins, what would that translate into?
Andrew Gould: We're not going to give you a percentage, Ole, but the decremental was very high, because whether you can't cut costs and when you're evacuating a place like Libya, you have very high decremental costs. So you can assume it was a very high percentage.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Yes. Just trying to get a feel for sort of as things normalized without pricing and the way margins would be, but I think can back into it from what you've said. Second question, Andrew, I mean talking about this nonsense pricing that the industry is engaged on, I mean how much of your capacity is tied up on nonsense pricing a the moment and when do you think it will roll off?
Andrew Gould: Well, not a great deal. As yet, there are probably 1 or 2 fairly large contracts where to retain them we've gone through nonsense pricing. But along as those contracts are long term, we know very well within the year's time, we won't selling the technology we bid on, so there's a possibly to recover margin in this. It's very much there. It's not -- what I'm worried about is, what I'm concerned about is that we're going into a market where the demand for this service is picking up very, very rapidly, and we still see a lot of nonsense pricing out there.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Would you think that - - you've been through a few cycles, so when do you think there'll be an environment where people will realize that it's better than nothing?
Andrew Gould: Yes, they will realize it when it has happened in 1 or 2 cases already, when they win contracts but they can't serve it because then the customers will become upset. And once the customers become upset, if you want to provide a decent service, you have to pay for it, right? So the emphasis will shift.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Do you see a scenario where international margins could catch up with North American margins? And if so, when would that be?
Andrew Gould: Well, that's going to depend an awful lot on 2 things in North America. The first is the speed with which the Gulf comes back after its initial flush of permits, right? So what is the total recon in the Gulf going to look like in 2012. And the second is, even if activity doesn't rollover, pricing rollover on land in North America because of the surge in capacity. So those 2 effects will come North America margins, they're a little bit unknown at the moment. But I think that absent the second leg to the recession or a severe drop in demand due to higher oil prices that the trend in international margins will, in the back half of this year, should accelerate. I mean as I said in my comments, more and more confident that the activity is there.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay, Andrew. Finally, this 1, could you quantify what you mean when you say spare capacity in the global oil markets have heightened up significantly as a result of this? Could you just share a little bit more of your thoughts on that?
Andrew Gould: Well, you've lost them -- well, I mean very rough numbers you've lost 800,000 to 1 million barrels a day out of Libya, which is having to be made up by other people, which means that from the global spare capacity which you could calculate is really being around 4.5 million, 5 million barrels a day, you've lost 1 million. And I actually think that political uncertainty will add to the need to add spare capacity or to have more spare capacity available in the world. And I think oil prices are reflecting that at this point in time.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Do you see that the scenario with the shale oil could become as big a surprise as what the shale gas goes to all of us?
Andrew Gould: You're going to have to define what you mean by shale oil, Ole.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay.
Andrew Gould: Are you talking about the Colorado...
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: On the global unconventional oil, what is the scope for that to surprise the way North America unconventional gas did over the past couple of years?
Andrew Gould: I don't know. I honestly don't know. I mean, we are looking at it, but I don't have a decent result. You want to say anything, Paal?
Paal Kibsgaard: No, I'm thinking -- well, I think at this stage, it is really is what is driving the sustained activity in North America, all right? But I mean we have -- some of these wells are produced for 1 or 2 years maximum, I'd say. It's still early to say how sustainable it is. But at this stage, it is looking quite promising.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much.
Andrew Gould: It's a light shale gas, Ole. It depends a lot on infrastructure.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: [indiscernible] completely wrong. So I'm just wondering what is the scope here that we can grow oil production significantly more than what anybody's kind of thinking about at the moment if [indiscernible].
Andrew Gould: Well, I don't think that you can take these reservoirs as being some form of way of replacing the Middle East or something.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Could we spend a little time on your seismic outlook, please? Very nicely optimistic. I guess what I -- maybe 1 way of asking the question is, how much of your optimism is based on the broad demand for seismic services, for Marine contract services, specifically versus kind of nice illustrations of coil shooting technology and uptick there or continued uptick. But how much of it is sort of technology driven and specifically, Schlumberger technology, just trying to parse between those 2?
Paal Kibsgaard: So I think the main basis for optimism at this stage is the fact that we have a very, very strong technology position both on the acquisition side and on the processing side, right? So the examples we showed on Coil Shooting is obviously at the absolute high end of it, but there's also a lot of other technologies within the offering which is unique to us, right? So we are quite, I would say, upbeat and optimistic on the basis of this strong technology position. I think what's going to be the key element that's going to determine the uptick on marine pricing is going to be what's happening -- what is going to happen in the Gulf. So I'd say whether the same round is going to go forward at the end of this year or early 2012. If that is the case, then I think there will be a significantly more multi-client acquisition activity in the Gulf, which again is going to tie up investments that are currently on third-party, and this, again will then hopefully create the pricing traction that we are looking for. I thought the counter to that is whether some of the players more and more specifically mine leading trend they keep adding vessels to the global's pick up. But overall the technology position is, at this stage, what makes us products optimistic and upbeat on seismic.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Understand. Just a couple of -- maybe some quick follow-ups on that. So I understand the Gulf position, but I guess you have new horizons in Brazil that you're securing some work to shoot as well, I'm sure there's more to come. Obviously, you have a number of emerging basins, can that -- I guess the suggestion is that can all soak up with capacity is today and is it a tighter sort of tighter outlook on that basis than perhaps you've even suggesting the last 6 months or is it more -- is it pretty similar?
Paal Kibsgaard: I think overseas, it is pretty similar, right? Yes, we've had these surveys planned and they were going ahead and that's good, and some of them are actually going more high-tech than what they initially thought. But I think the main doubt there is how many vessels are going to be attracted into the Gulf of Mexico as we get ready for this lease turnaround.
Andrew Gould: I would just add, if I may, Paal, that the awards of blocks in the Kwanza basin in Angola were all the people who've been awarded have a time-limited in which they have to shoot 2,500 square kilometers of seismic is a fairly significant event in demand over the next 18 months.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: That's very helpful. 1 last 1 quickly. Your backlog of $900 million in WesternGeco, how does that compare with a quarter ago?
Simon Ayat: We've slightly improved.
Andrew Gould: It's a slight improvement, I might say, Brad.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, very good. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: I've got a couple of quick follow-ups. First, on North America, if I think about just the changing complexion of the market with liquids and foreign capital, IOC is coming back. Does the liquids and just, call it the toolkit required to get to that resource and the operator mix shift at all? Did Schlumberger benefit disproportionately from those 2 factors, you think in terms of your opportunities for market share?
Andrew Gould: I would say not at this stage. I still think as you know, I said on many occasions that for both these liquid-rich plays, as well as the gas plays that longer term, the current technology is extremely wasteful and longer term that's going to shift and it's going to shift to a point where the completed zones will be pinpointed rather than being almost statistically frac-ed, but the technology is still 2 or 3 years away from that probably.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Okay. So the resource that we're after doesn't really change that underlying trend that you've been talking about for a while then?
Andrew Gould: No, not really. Not really. The tool set is not there yet.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Okay. Thank you, Andrew. On quickly follow up on the seismic side, Paal, your comment that sort of the technology uptake early on, if I could sort of think about exploration cycles from leasing rounds to seismic acquisition, I think the uptake rate historically was pretty slow in the sense that you had lease and then some maybe 2D and as you got more comfortable, you went to 3D, but the technology penetration seems to be occurring a lot faster in the cycle. So is it correct to say that there's in effect a double lever this time around and that exploration activity is growing very rapidly? And that you're seeing that technology penetration much sooner in the cycle?
Andrew Gould: Mike, I'm just going to answer that because it's a subject I really enjoy. The advent of our technology is almost redefining the way in which people will do their initial delineation after 3D. So for example, a lot of the work we're doing in Brazil, is they've made the discovery, they've identified the reservoir, but before they go into development, they want to have a really, really high resolution map of the actual reservoir from seismic. So the technology is redefining to a certain extent the way that they're applying it, applying seismic as a tool.
Paal Kibsgaard: And if can add, I think also in the past, you may have had options of whether you went to 2D or conventional 3D and you could still get a reasonable view of the reservoir. And with some of the reservoirs that we are chasing now below salt, there is only 1 option in some cases and that is called shooting. So in fact, the need to move to high-end technology even to get some cycle answer is a lot more significant at this stage and that's why I think the technology uptake again is going to be quicker and higher.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: That's great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we'll go to line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: The question I have is when you look at the numbers, you had really impressive international margin performance from around 900 basis points better than your closest competitor. So with that, what dynamics are in place that could provide Schlumberger with the opportunity to increase this spread? And do these dynamics provide a unique opportunity for Schlumberger relative to your competitors?
Paal Kibsgaard: So if you look at the margins overseas, again, similar to North America, we also are mostly very confident in our ability to basically continue to widen the margin gap that we have versus the competition. Some of the reasons for that is that we still see a significant margin upside from the Smith integration as we continue to get both the revenue synergies and the cost synergy and as we switch into the exploration phase, the value mix of our services is, I would say still significantly higher or more favorable than that of our competitor. And also given our size at this stage and the focus that we have put over the past year on internal efficiencies, there is significant cost in margin potentials from our side. So I would say that generally, the margin momentum we have overseas is significant and we will continue to pursue it and maintain a very meaningful margin gap towards our competition.
Andrew Gould: Kurt, we explained in Boston and I'll repeat it, that as prices go up and as projects become more and more difficult, service quality and technology become more and more important and the operator's desire to take chances diminish, and I think that's what you see happening.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay, great. That's all for me. Thank you so much.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of James West with Barclays Capital.
James West - Barclays Capital: Good morning, guys. Andrew, I had a question about the Middle East specifically. We obviously see the ramp up that's occurring in Iraq and we have improving trends in Saudi here. For your other customers in the region, are they starting to consider or starting to accelerate programs in response to this perhaps to secure service capacity?
Andrew Gould: I don't think we've seen that yet, but I don't think it's very far away, Jim.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay.
Andrew Gould: I don't think -- I can't honestly say we've seen it yet, but I don't see it far away, James.
James West - Barclays Capital: But it certainly hasn't gone unrecognized what those two countries are doing, I would assume?
Andrew Gould: Absolutely not, no. And also the Gulf, they're reissuing permits in the Gulf. The operators all notice these things.
James West - Barclays Capital: Understood. And then one question actually on the Gulf of Mexico, it has been a negative drag on earnings. If we assume your cost structure as it is today and your current market share -- historical market share there, how many rigs do you need running in deepwater to turn breakeven or positive from an earnings perspective in the Gulf?
Andrew Gould: We've never been negative in the Gulf. So we've kept most of the infrastructure in place. We do not export a bunch of equipment, so there's not a huge amount of investment and we will bring people, the skill -- the very skilled people who we’ve been using overseas from the Gulf, back into the Gulf, so the actual cost structure is not going to be significantly different from what it was before. So we will -- the margin, as Paal pointed out a few minutes ago, are going to accelerate pretty rapidly.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of John David Anderson with JPMorgan.
John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Good morning. Andrew, you probably have a good insight and mentality that anyone has seen out there, just kind of a related question of what James is asking but specifically about Manifa. Would Manifa have happened at this time it wasn't for Libya? In other words, was Manifa planning to go at this stage all along or have we seen a change in kind of the way Aramco is operating and kind of accelerating things and I guess you're saying you think it's out there, has anything kind of shift in terms of your views of the international cycle as it kind of all fits in together?
Andrew Gould: I'm absolutely not going to make any comments on those specific policies of Saudi Aramco. They always had the option of accelerating Manifa in the various times. In the last two years, they've slowed it down and they've accelerated it. They're now, at this point in time, it's not for me to speculate. But yes, I think that the absence of good production worries the oil producers generally because while they like a high-level price, you don't like a higher oil price because of they potential they have to destroy demand. So where we see a greater activity from other NOCs, I think we probably will. And also, don't forget that this activity that's being added, we do not see that coming at the expense of the expansion of gas activity which is already taking place in the Middle East.
John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So is it fair to say you're incrementally more positive on terms of the timing of the international spend than you were 90 days ago?
Andrew Gould: I have a great deal more of comfort that is -- well, firstly, I'm more confident it's happening because we can see what's being built, what's being mobilized and the rest of it. And given the geopolitical circumstances, the condition of Libya and Japan and everything else, yes, I think that I'm much more confident that the international spend are going to come much faster.
John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And also, Andrew, in your release you talked about exploration spending ticking up and we're starting to see it pretty well distributed globally. I was wondering if you could just kind of provide some context as you should see how exploration versus development spending evolves over the next couple of years compared to last cycle? In other words, if you look out the next kind of 12 months, how does that kind of spending makes up exploration? Where does that compare? Are we looking kind of like '05, '06 and how that ramped up, how are you thinking about that as you look out?
Andrew Gould: I think the biggest -- there are two significant changes in the way the exploration might occur in this cycle. The first is obviously the availability of deepwater rigs and the relative increase in our knowledge of how to prospect in deepwater compared to 5 or 6 years ago, that's 1. And the second is, the national oil companies themselves coming back to exploration which is not something that they did on any scale in the previous cycles. So generally and if you look at a basket of oil companies, private ones, the reserves in production ratios are not great. Where they have acreage is going to be perspective with these oil prices, I think they will substantially increase their exploration spend and you're seeing one or two of them out there.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William Herbert - Simmons: Sticking with the Middle East, Asia-Pacific region here quickly. Andrew, back in '05, '06, '07, we had sort of annualized revenue growth of 20% to 30%, almost hard to believe that now. I mean, clearly, you were coming from the smaller base, you were in the midst of Saudi tripling its rig count. But based upon the broad and building swell that you're seeing right now in the Middle East, do we get back to those kind of annualized revenue growth rates, do you think?
Andrew Gould: Well, first, you have to remember the biggest change between now and then is we have Smith. And we have the opportunity to expand both Smith and M-I SWACO in those regions that we did not have in the previous cycle. Activity wise, I don't think -- I still don't think it's going to ramp as fast as it did in '05, '06 because the tripling of the rig count in Saudi was sort of once in 100 year event almost overseas because overseas never normally go that far. But over time, can we double some of them in the Asia again? Yes, I think we can.
William Herbert - Simmons: Okay. Secondly, with regard to Drilling and Measurement, sort of performance-based contracts, I'm curious as to how your appetite for performance-based contracts, Paal, will shift in the event we get the supply-demand framework for D&M tightening and pricing improving demonstrably relative to the supercompetitive environment today. Does that lessen your appetite for performance-based pricing and improving overall pricing environment or is it still sort of a strategy of your irrespective of pricing where you want more performance-based contracts?
Paal Kibsgaard: Yes. I don't think the pricing of capacity necessarily is going to change our strategy on that. I think the benefit of this model is that we have the ability to set ourselves apart from the competition due to the stronger performance that we have and obviously, if there's a tightening of capacity and the base prices continue to go up. They will have to be a higher value for the performance that we put up. But the contractual framework very much holds water in a tighter capacity situation as well. We will continue to push that and make sure that we get our fair share of the value that we create with our customers.
William Herbert - Simmons: Now I'm sure it varies by contract and by customer, but remind us basically the framework of how performance-based pricing works. What's the base pricing, if you will? Is it at a discount to what you would otherwise charge in a standard contract? And clearly, you're going to get something above and beyond what you would get on a standardized basis in the event that you deliver on the performance, but remind us the framework, if you will, as to how the performance-based pricing works.
Paal Kibsgaard: What you said is pretty much the case. These things vary significantly and in terms of how you formulate it in the various contracts and the various customers. But the principle is, that there is a basic fee that we get for being there and doing the work and that could typically be lower than what normal pricing would be. But then there is a similar upside for us to harvest in the event that we outperform what is currently perceived to be the benchmark and the benchmark would be the average performance of I would say us and the various competitors. So exactly how you're formulating contracts varies somewhat, but that's the basic principle. And by having that basic principle is just a matter of how much you put on the basic fee and how much you put on the performance upside. And at the end of the day, for us to deploy equipment into these types of contracts for customers in a tightening market, it would have to be attractive.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Mike Urban with Deutsche Bank.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG: Andrew or Paal, you talked about the tightening you see in pricing, I guess, initially in the Drilling and Measurements. Is that -- given the increase visibility that you've seen, was that something you felt was going to be happening anyway as we progressed here or is that been more a function of Saudi coming back into the market in terms of your view?
Andrew Gould: One more time, I always thought I may have been wrong but D&M will be the segment that tightens first partly because they lose a lot of equipment. And so if you have an increase in activity and the normal rate of equipment lasted, things tend to tighten very fast unless industry is completely overbuilt. Now the Gulf of Mexico and Saudi Arabia are both very heavy users of D&M equipment. So those events have probably given us confidence that pricing is going to come back soon.
Paal Kibsgaard: I agree. You said year-end early on and I think it will definitely by year-end, if not, the second half of the year.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And then after D&M, where would we progress in terms of the tightening cycle in pricing?
Paal Kibsgaard: Well, I think the next segment that we would see that in will be in more slightly open-hole Wireline. That's the next in line for that. So probably similar tougher times, maybe slightly off in Drilling and Measurements but very quickly Wireline as well.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG: And then where do you have -- conversely, where do you have the most excess capacity in the industry? What would be last to tighten?
Andrew Gould: Sorry, again?
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG: What would be the last? Where should we see -- expect to see the pricing lagging?
Andrew Gould: I don't -- it's very difficult to say. That will depend an awful lot on how capacity evolves in North America, whether we overbuild or we don't overbuild.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, got you. That's all for me. Thank you.
Operator: And we have time for one last question. And we'll go to the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Andrew, you've mentioned a couple of times now that either you've replaced one of your competitors on several contracts or that as you anticipate perhaps doing it in the future given their inability to deliver on contracts. I'm just curious when you're replacing some on these contracts, are you doing it -- so not only getting the volume pickup, but are you doing it typically at a higher price in what the competitor was doing that work for?
Andrew Gould: We are not an insurance policy for our competitors. In other words, if we replace them, we do not agree to the contractual terms that they accepted to get the job. If we accept to replace them at their contract value, we're just an insurance policy.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Okay, sure. So there is some an embedded pricing improvement, I guess, in that. And then just one follow-up...
Andrew Gould: Paal wants to say something.
Paal Kibsgaard: No, as we decide to take on someone else's contract whether that's for 1 well or 2 wells or whatever it is, we'd obviously look at the value of that contract and whether it's something that we do want to take on. So it would have to be attractive again for us to do it and increasingly so when our competition keeps bidding low and our customers want us to come in that amount [ph].
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Sure. Just as we look for the quarter 2 here, can you give some just sense in terms of -- you had almost a 10% drop in your revenues in first quarter from fourth quarter. Just I know we had seasonal issues clearly that were addressed, but can we just talk a little bit about top line recovery here as we kind of look out the next couple of quarters and maybe how you think -- you guys think about as a whole year-over-year growth perhaps 2011 versus 2010 given what's going on in North Africa?
Andrew Gould: So the bulk of the revenue drop outside North America was either seasonal or geopolitical. So obviously, Libya is not coming back, right? The rest of it probably will. And the mobilization of projects towards the end of the quarter offshore was quite high. So second quarter, can we recover what we lost compared to Q4, for example? I don't think we're going to be very far away.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Okay. Thanks Andrew and Paal for your time.
Malcolm Theobald: In closing, I would like to thank Robert Bergeron for his support during his time as Manager for Investor Relation and wish him luck in his next assignment.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Results Conference Call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statement. And now I will turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.85 per share. This is an increase of $0.15 sequentially and $0.18 compared to the same quarter of last year.  During the quarter, we recorded $0.09 of charges relating to the repurchase of certain bonds and other merger-related items. We anticipate we would continue to incur merger-related charges throughout 2011, as we continue the integration of Smith.  The Q4 results include a full quarter of activity from the acquired Smith companies as compared to only one month in the Q3. We have continued to make significant progress on our integration during the quarter, and while the transaction was dilutive to the quarter's result by approximately $0.05, we continue to believe it will be breakeven by the end of the fourth quarter of this year.  Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue increased 9% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue increased 17%. The legacy Smith businesses contributed $2.5 billion in revenue for the quarter. Approximately 25% of the growth in Oilfield Services was attributable to the traditional year end surge in product and software sales. The remaining increase was largely due to the continued strong Well Services performance in U.S. Land, as well as the revenue generated from the early payout of an IPM [Integratd Project Management] gain share project in North America.  Oilfield Services pretax operating income of $1.3 billion increased 21% compared to the prior quarter. While pretax operating margin increased 224 basis points to 22.1%. This increase was largely driven by the strong performance in North America where margin improved by 6.6 percentage points.  Now margins grew 658 basis points to 24% led by U.S. Land. The early payout of the IPM gain share project, which contributed approximately $0.02 to the fourth quarter earnings per share accounted for just over 2 percentage points of the North America margin improvement. International margins improved sequentially by 49 basis points to 21.9%. This improvement was primarily driven by a more favorable revenue mix in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and North Sea GeoMarkets. In the Middle East, pretax operating margin decreased as effects of year-end product and software sales were not sufficient to offset the impact of the weather-related delays in Australia, start-up costs in Iraq and an overall less favorable revenue mix.  Sequentially, WesternGeco pretax operating income increased by $73 million to $113 million and pretax operating margin increased by almost 12 percentage points to 20.2% on account of robust monthly client sales. The legacy Smith segment, particularly Smith Oilfield Services performed very well, contributing $275 million of pretax operating income to the quarter's results.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits was 23.1%, representing an increase of just over 2 percentage points compared to last quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the fact that we generated a significantly larger portion of our earnings in North America in the Q4, as well as the continued impact of the Smith merger. We expect the ETR for the full year of 2011 to be in the mid-20s. This reflects the planned mix of activity between North America and the rest of the world, as well as the full-year impact of the Smith merger. However, I continue to remind you that we can experience volatility on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash and investments on hand and short-term debt of $1.7 billion. Net debt was $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter as compared to $3.5 billion at the end of Q3. This improvement reflects very strong cash collections in the fourth quarter.  Other significant liquidity events during the quarter, included $1 billion of CapEx, $449 million of stock repurchases and $200 million contribution to our retiree medical plan.  During the quarter, we issued $1.3 billion of 2.75% notes due in 2015. And subsequent to the quarter end, we issued $1.1 billion of 4.2% notes due in 2021 and $500 million of 2.65% notes due in 2016.  Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a 19% increase in our dividend, which brings our annual dividend to $1 per share. This increase reflects the fact that we have not increased our dividend over the past two years and is consistent with our intention to return excess cash to our shareholders. Along the same lines, we will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive, when appropriate with our stock buyback activity.  Throughout all of 2010, we spent $1.7 billion repurchasing 26.6 million shares at an average price of $64.48. Despite the fact that we were blacked out for a significant period as a result of the Smith transaction. CapEx for all of Schlumberger is expected to approach $4 billion in 2011 as compared to $2.9 billion in 2010.  Lastly, I just want to remind everyone that starting next quarter, our primary segment reporting will be based on our group structure. In this regard, shortly after this call, we will be publishing an update to the pro forma financial information that were released in early December to reflect the Q4 and full year 2010 result in this new format. This information can be found on our website. And now, I will turn the conference over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Schlumberger fourth quarter revenue was at $9.07 billion versus $6.85 billion in the third quarter of 2010 and $5.74 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. These figures reflect the full quarter of activity from the acquired Smith businesses.  In Oilfield Services, North America activity remained strong through growing demand for services in liquid-rich plays and from seasonal improvements in Canada. Improved pricing and the restructuring efforts that we began in April continued to contribute to margin expansion, particularly for Well Services activities. Results also benefited from the accelerated IPM gain share on the sale by the customer for projects on land in the U.S., which clearly demonstrates how this business model can create value.  Outside North America, activity improvements in the North Sea, West Africa and Middle East & Asia GeoMarkets, coupled with strong year and product sales, particularly for software, more than offset the combination of continued weakness in Mexico and the seasonal activity decline in Russia. While this was balanced to some degree by the rapid ramp up of activity in Iraq, which did not yield equivalent profitability as it was impacted by heavy start-up costs.  Our WesternGeco, excellent fourth quarter multiclient sales were mostly due to the enhanced quality of subsalt imaging products in the Gulf of Mexico, while the acquired Smith businesses continue to outperform our original expectations with revenue synergies, through the acquisition, increasing in each successive month of the quarter.  This quarterly report is particularly rich in technical success, whether through the continuing market penetration of leading services such as the Scope advanced logging-while-drilling measurements, scanner Wireline technologies or ACTive coiled tubing services, the integrated nature of the portfolio underscored considerable success.  Scanner services, for example, are being boosted by the commercial introduction of the latest family member, the Dielectric Scanner, the unique industry service capable of measuring saturation and a variety of reservoir applications, the service completed a two-year pilot project in Saudi Arabia, targeted at reservoir monitoring where 35 logs have been recorded in various fields, both on land and offshore to assess water flooding sweep efficiency as an aid to field development planning. The result showed the technology is capable of determining oil saturation, independent of water salinity while achieving efficiency gains over previous monitoring methods, and have now led to the service being considered for use in heavy oil and [indiscernible] sand environments.  In Reservoir production, ACTive realtime coiled tubing services saw growth particularly with the ACTive conveyance of wireline close scanner production logging technology and with fiber optics' continuous measurements of temperature and pressure along the wellbore. Expanding the primary integrated technologies such as these, confirmed conveyance enabled wireline services to have exciting growth opportunities, particularly in horizontal and extended reach wells.  It is however, in the drilling portfolio that displayed some of the most exciting successes. These included the completion of the remote three-well exploration project offshore Greenland that use Schlumberger technologies combined with Smith and M-I SWACO services, as well as Geoservices mud logging. In Brazil, a similar combination of services helped one well record substantial increases in rates of penetration while meeting all the directional drilling goals. In this case, the integrated nature of the bottomhole assembly demonstrated how technology optimization can impact performance in the high cost deepwater drilling environment. A third such operation offshore Indonesia, further confirm the value of integrated bottomhole assemblies.  Finally, I would like to mention the inauguration of two new Schlumberger facilities in Brazil to support one of becoming the fastest-growing regions in the world. On November 16, we opened the Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center in Rio de Janeiro. And the following day, our latest new generation operations based in Macaé. The new research center is designed to promote the integration of geosciences and engineering to improve hydrocarbon production and recovery from the complex deep water reservoirs and pre-salt carbonates offshore Brazil. The center also has as a new WesternGeco geo-solutions center dedicated to processing of the revolutionary single-vessel full azimuth Q-Marine services that have now penetrated all the major offshore areas around the world.  As we look forward to 2011, it is important to remember that the primary driver of our business has always been and will remain the demand for oil and gas. For oil, 2010 turned out to be the year of the second largest demand increase in the last 30 years. The consensus forecast of demand in 2011 shows a further healthy increase. Oil prices are moving to a range that would encourage increased investment particularly in exploration, which remains the swing factor in operators' budgets. While we do not anticipate any substantial recovery in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we do expect a marked increase in deep water activity in the rest of the world. These factors, coupled with increases in development activity and production enhancement in many other areas promise stronger growth rate as the year unfolds.  For natural gas, demand recovery has been less marked. The increases in supply of both unconventional gas in the United States and liquified natural gas around the world will limit the progress of prices. Nonetheless, activity in the United States is likely to remain strong, at least through the first half of the year, due to commitments necessary to retain leases, the backlog of wells to be completed and the contribution of natural gas liquids to overall project economics. Increased service capacity, however, will negatively affect pricing at some stage during the year.  Overseas, the governing factor on gas activity, particularly in the Middle East will be the ability of many nations to use gas as a substitute for oil to meet increased local energy demand, thus freeing up more liquids for export. Elsewhere, the long lead time necessary to execute large gas projects for LNG exports will ensure that a certain level of activity is maintained.  Unconventional gas resources will continue to attract considerable interest outside North America. The leading activity will continue to be in conventional gas, in tight or low permeability reservoirs and in coal-bed methane development. There will be exploration activity around the potential that shale gas offers in many other parts of the world.  Increased activity, coupled with greater technology needs of higher exploration, deepwater spend and tight gas, particularly outside North America, will make 2011 a stronger year for Schlumberger. The importance of risk reduction and the minimization of drilling cost make the acquisitions of Geoservices and Smith, major contributors to our future growth in this scenario. Thank you. And Julie, I think we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: I guess, and then the first question, I would just love to hear a little bit more on what was a very impressive revenue growth number in the U.S. land market? For just a little bit more color, if you would, sort of utilization of assets, if you could comment on capacity increase and then on pricing, that would be helpful?
Andrew Gould: The biggest contributors in Q4 as opposed to Q3 were still efficiency gains in activity, with some contribution though not huge from increased capacity. So it really was more the results of the restructuring efforts. In terms of price, the Q4 effect was less than the Q3 effect. So it really was the results of the restructuring efforts, much better efficiency and much better utilization that led the improvement.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Perhaps as a follow-up, let's stick with the same part of the world, could you offer some thoughts on the Gulf of Mexico and your outlook? I know you spoke to it a little bit in your comments, but your outlook for the next couple of quarters specifically, and then, also as we move into the end of this year?
Andrew Gould: I don't think we anticipate any major return to work in the first half of the year. I think we may see a few rigs come back, but we still think that there are a number of issues that the operators really need clear resolution on, before they are in a position to apply for new permits. And we anticipate that in the second half of the year, the rate of increase will accelerate, but we don't think we're going back to anything like the 33 rigs that we're drilling when the moratorium started in 2011.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: But you're assuming that your...
Andrew Gould: In 2012, if you're asking do I doubt the future of deepwater Gulf of Mexico? Absolutely not. And I think that our multi-client sales we are very good proxy for the fact that there is still a huge interest in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. But until some of the questions around the regulation and the definition of liability and the definition to what constitutes well containment is settled, it's difficult to know exactly who the client base is going to be.
Operator: The next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Andrew, you referenced, obviously, on your commentary the IPM project in North America. And you put that to impact in the commentary as well. So I'm just curious here. Can you elaborate a little bit more on this IPM gain sharing project and can you elaborate more on how this business model has evolved for Schlumberger and how can we think about that impacting Schlumberger differentially compared to its peers as we move forward?
Andrew Gould: So the project in question was in the Bakken. The owner of the project was a private equity, so therefore we did absolutely everything. We invested service as our share of the investment. Normally, we would have been paid out on the ratio of our services over the balance of the whole project life. But the agreement contained a resolution in case if the owners selling the property, which gave us the same multiple on our invested services cost as the seller obtained on his sale. So what I'm saying is that it is unlikely that these projects get sold very often because it's far more likely that a continue for a long period of time, particularly outside the United States where they tend to be with national oil companies rather than with private investors. But it does demonstrate how well our technology allows the customer to create considerable value in a short period of time, how we can share in it.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: So in the context of that, as we think about this from a financial community standpoint, it's something that could recur, but it's something...
Andrew Gould: No. It's something which is providing a new income agreement in Schlumberger, which is not particularly visible yet, it is not big enough. But very satisfactory returns. The only reason you saw this in one quarter was because the operator sold it. And overseas particularly, it's unlikely that operators, particularly as the national oil companies will sell them, so the gain will be spread over the contract life as opposed to come in one quarter.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: In U.S., you referenced, again, some concern about potential pricing pressure in the market. How would you characterize your conviction in that perspective? And is it something that we could be looking to update and change maybe on a quarter-on-quarter basis?
Andrew Gould: I mean, I don't -- I've been wrong on North America so often Kurt, that I'm reluctant to say too much. I don't think there's a huge risk to activity in the first half of the year. I do think that pricing momentum is going to slow progressively. But at the point where it tips over, I suspect it's going to depend on when the capacity out there is sufficient to address the current activity. And it looks, it's in fact, in the second half of the year, not the first.
Operator: The next question is from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Andrew, when do you think that, most probably, is the first exploration well and deep well in Gulf of Mexico?
Andrew Gould: I'm going to go out on a limb here, and say the end of 2011 or the beginning of 2012. Are you're saying rank exploration or delineation?
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Rank exploration.
Andrew Gould: 2012. I'm going out on a limb, I'm guessing.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So could talk a little bit about what could -- your thought process around why 2012 and the...
Andrew Gould: Well, but for all the reasons I gave to Brad earlier. Firstly, while there's some of the regulations have been defined, some of them haven't, the need for environmental assessments and spill containment capability is on the way but is not yet there and it's not yet, I think, necessarily clearly understood how the operators are going to share that. I think that the operators are not going to commit until they're pretty sure of the framework within which they're going to operate. And I just doubt that for ranked exploration, we're going to get that clarity in 2011.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: And if we look elsewhere in the world, what you'll see is the most prospective exploration basis at the moment, and whether it'd be seismic activity or well testing or any other of your exploration-oriented services, are there any new basins that could, in 2011, pick up the slack from Gulf of Mexico?
Andrew Gould: Well, I mean, when we look at -- let me answer you that another way. When we a look at deepwater in 2011, the number of effective rig years added, so this is not the number of rigs added, it's the number of rig years, which is the number of months they're actually drilling, right? It is much is substantially greater than in 2010. And if I leave aside Brazil, where everybody knows the story and you can, to some extent, make your own estimate of how may rigs will actually get added, then I think the most prospective area we're going to see in terms of deepwater exploration in 2011 is West and East Africa. And to some extent, remote Indonesia.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: What are your thoughts on WesternGeco in this context? Is the fact that the Gulf of Mexico is a bit of a vacuum, maybe this year a problem or is the international momentum strong enough?
Andrew Gould: We think that the momentum in proprietary seismic outside of the United States is sufficient to absorb capacity, but the lack of the Gulf of Mexico is going to slow pricing. We thought we would get pricing momentum back early this year. We are now thinking that if we do get it back, it's going to be late this year. The big question I think on seismic for 2011 is if there is prospectively a large lease sale at the beginning 2012, then multiclient could be very strong in the second half of this year.
Operator: The next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Partners.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: If I could ask a question on fracing, as it relates to a comment you made earlier. Last year, about drilling geometrically versus drilling geologically. The frac market has been essentially geometric as well, but there's evidence that, that market is perhaps migrating more towards an intelligent model faster than the shale drilling market in North America. Could you talk about that?
Andrew Gould: What are you comparing to the shale market? The liquid market or what? The drilling...
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: I'm sorry, I'm referring to drilling versus completions, and the trend of geometric to geologic activity.
Andrew Gould: I think you have to assume that over time, that you call it geologically. But geologically, what we're trying to do is to drill in such a way that we can identify the place where we want to have completions instead of geometrically completing it because we don't really know where the sweet spots are. We can't classify them well enough to do in other ways. I think that progress is being made. I think that this is going to go faster outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. for the reason that a lot of the environmental concerns and the infrastructure concerns that can be addressed in the North American market cannot be addressed overseas, and therefore, people are going to be a lot more careful. And we, definitely, are seeing that. So over time, yes, I still believe that completions will be designed geologically as opposed to geometrically. And that drilling & measurements will become a tool to reduce the intensity of fracs, but we're not there yet.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: But those markets are essentially trending in tandem as opposed to -- it strikes me that perhaps the completions market with microseismic and variable staging is perhaps moving more towards an intelligent model faster than...
Andrew Gould: Yes, I don't think we would include microseismic in that because microseismic is a saltwater service. In other words, it's done after the frac. What we're talking about is services that are rendered before the fact in such a way that you design the completion to minimize the footprint and eliminate the fracs, but inevitably the preparations for the frac can never produce anything.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: For a follow-on, can you talk quickly about the reservoir surveillance collaborations with Shell and what that the broader opportunity might look like?
Andrew Gould: We are seeing a very considerable increase in business associated around the design of EOR programs, particularly in the Middle East. Shell is very active, particularly in Oman in EOR. And the programs that we have with Shell are around services where our capacity to do characterization with downhole tools can be matched with Shell's knowledge of how the reservoir behaves. And I would say that the collaboration at the moment is linked to two very specific services and going forward, we'll see how it goes.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Is it a scalable model though?
Andrew Gould: I'm sorry in terms of collaboration?
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: In terms of participating and the size of programs with other operators?
Andrew Gould: Well, to be honest Michael, we have programs and this is what we liked about Brazil, really, as I talked about Petrobras, right? And I mean, in the same we have it with the many others around the world. In this particular case, Shell wanted to make press release.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: So it falls within the classification of generally technical collaboration?
Andrew Gould: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Urban with Deutsche Bank.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG: Andrew, you talked about exploration as a swing factor in operator budgets. Is that something that you're already seeing and is reflected in your current outlook? Or would you view it as upside as you see, I guess oil demand continue to improve in confidence, improving as the commodity price hold up?
Andrew Gould: I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I think everybody noticed that Total made a public statement about the amount of exploration that we're going to do. And when we visit potentially strong exploration GeoMarkets at this point in time, we find customers making a lot of inquiries that they weren't making 3 months ago. So a lot of it will be second-half year. And why is it the swing factor? It's the swing factor because it's the only thing they can ramp up quickly. They can't ramp up big new development projects quickly because the amount of engineering that's necessary. And therefore, the swing factor is exploration, and to some extent, trying to enhance production from existing fields.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG: And unrelated follow-up, on the CapEx side, a decent increase but less than might have thought, given that you have a full year of the Smith. Is that function of better asset utilization and synergies between the two or is that something that we could see under upward pressure because opportunities materialize or cost inflation or...
Andrew Gould: So firstly, we will review CapEx particularly in the CapEx-intensive segments every quarter. And any CapEx that we authorize in the end of March, for example, will hit the end of the year. If it's beyond that, it's 2012. You have to remember that Smith is not a CapEx intensive business. It was not a CapEx intensive business nearly to the extent that Schlumberger is, so you can assume that the bulk of the increase is Schlumberger not Smith.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William Herbert - Simmons: Andrew, similar to the exercise that you took us through on deepwater, in terms of markets that are expected to witness the most pronounced positive rate of change year-over-year. Can you walk us through that exercise for international onshore markets? 2011 versus 2010, what looks to witness the biggest positive deltas ex-Iraq?
Andrew Gould: Sort of the one huge unknown, which is Mexico, right? And if you exclude that, then you have to assume that Russia will be very positive, could be. I don't think that the recent change in the export duty law that was announced a couple of days ago will have a great deal effect in 2011 because most of the guys have fixed their budgets already. Then I think you have to assume that places like Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Land Brazil, where you have a lot of new independent operators. That we will see a recovery in what was a very weak North Africa in 2010. Weak, as you know, for a number of reasons, but we should see some recovery this year until the extent that the oil price is higher, then it will be that much better.
William Herbert - Simmons: Are there markets which are building over and mobilizing over the course of this year, which set up for a very strong or much stronger 2012? Two markets, for example, which come to mind, which have announced significant multiyear spending programs. KPC, a $90 billion program over 5 to 7, 8 years, something like that. ADNOC putting $60 billion dollars to work in Zakum, places like that. I mean, are there markets that are really mobilizing hard in '11 that's set up for a much bigger 2012?
Andrew Gould: Yes.
William Herbert - Simmons: Which are?
Andrew Gould: I will mention 2 obvious ones. Yes. If you look back into the 2004, 2007 cycle, the only country in the Middle East that substantially increased its oil production was Saudi Arabia. And I think the Saudis feel that it's time the neighbors do their bit.
William Herbert - Simmons: And then the second lined of inquiry, if you will, is North America, and not going to pin you down here with regard to when exactly margins roll, but I guess in terms of your expectation here, using '06 to 2008 before the world came going to an end as an analog, when we had the capacity growth and then the market became more balanced and the margins over kind of '06 to '08 normalize, if you will, and if I look at Schlumberger, specifically, your margins peaked out at 30%, 31% in North America. And then, over two years, basically you regressed to kind of a low 20s range. So it wasn't a collapse, but it was a normalization.
Andrew Gould: Can I just say, it was a lot better than previous cycle though.
William Herbert - Simmons: Indeed. And those are good margins even in sort of a normalized state. And so I'm wondering, is the expectation this time around for a similar evolution or are you looking for something more dramatic with regard to a margin response based upon all the capacity that's coming?
Andrew Gould: You mean capacity...
William Herbert - Simmons: No, the impact on capacity. You mentioned that sensibly, that you think that the pricing momentum is going to slow and the implicit statement there is that margin is obviously, but that momentum is going to slow as well, and at some point, they're going to roll. And I guess what I'm interested in is your perspective with regard to the evolution of that margin roll, is it a normalization or is it a more dramatic reduction in margins over time? What's your expectation at this stage?
Andrew Gould: I think that the service intensity is such that absent the collapse in the oil price, because the collapse in the gas price we basically have already. Absence the collapse in the price that there will be a normalization but not a total collapse. In North America I'm talking about.
Operator: It comes from the line of Daniel Boyd with Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Andrew, I'd like to just to get your thoughts on the progression of margins internationally? Just when you think about there are three drivers, right? There's pricing, volumes but then there's also mix that can be impacted as you upsell technology. Can you just give us your thoughts on where you are on the pricing front, but also, where you're on the product and exploration cycle? Seismic isn't picking up, but you did mention in the commentary that you had a poor mix in the Middle East?
Andrew Gould: The fourth quarter is traditionally not a great mix in the Middle East because of the Artificial Lift in completion sales, which obviously have lower margins than our measurement technology. I think that international margins, bidding international markets on large developments will remain for comparable technology extremely competitive because everyone wants to grow overseas. But the higher the oil the price is, the more people are in a hurry, the more exploration they do, the more that we are going to be able to upgrade our technology sales. And if you remember, I think, I said publicly on several occasions that we actually did slow technology introduction a little bit in 2009, 2010 because we felt that the pricing environment was not such that we could realize the full value. I think you will see in 2011 and 2012 the rate at which we introduced new technology, particularly towards the end of this year and even most importantly in 2012, it's going to increase considerably.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then a follow-up on a comment you made earlier, on one hand you have exploration, which oil companies can pick up quickly, but then you also have work on mature field, which I know it goes back to the root of IPM. Can you comment on whether you're -- are you seeing IPM bidding activity on mature fields picking up? And what type of growth rate could we expect as we look out over the year?
Andrew Gould: I don't think, well -- IPM tends to be a huge project or nothing. So is the dollar volume of projects on which we're bidding are much higher? It's much, much higher. But actually how many deals we will land, and what effect it will have an 2011 is very difficult to put a number on. So I've absolutely learned, no doubt we will land a couple of big deals, but I suspect they're more likely to be significant in 2012 rather than 2011.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Andrew, do you just come out which regions are you're seeing that activities increasing the most?
Andrew Gould: I would much rather not. I'm not going to give a roadmap to some of my friends.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Andrew, I was hoping perhaps you could talk a little bit about, just in the short-term how we should think about the progression in Eastern hemispheres as we look at fourth quarter to first quarter with product and software sales not recurring in 1Q, and more intense whether Russian say the North Sea causing them seasonal disruptions there. How do we think about the progression for the first quarter either top line, in margin in Eastern hemispheres as a whole or maybe some sort of cents per share that you could patch that for us, perhaps that's a bit of question for Simon.
Andrew Gould: Well, we don't give guidance, Bill, as you know. But we won't be as totally surprised if the earnings, EPS in Q1 is lower than in Q4, because of the seasonality of both the Russian market, which you know is very large for us. The weather effects of the North Sea and the absence of the sales, the product and software sales that we have been known for. And the big number there, of course, is that Q4 is always the highest quarter for multiclient seismic, and which did extremely well, and Q1 will be much lower in, of course, Mexico.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: I know we've especially reiterated outlook as it relates to an expected kind of breakeven expectation on Smith by fourth quarter '11. In the past, you've quantified the cost savings related to this deal. I think we've heard more positive commentary about the revenue synergies here. Anything, Andrew in terms of mix that's changing your outlook and how you get to breakeven, at some point, do we start getting a little bit more quantification on the revenue pull-through or revenue synergies you see from the Smith deal?
Andrew Gould: Bill, we will give you a full update on revenue and cost synergies at Investor Day in Boston in February, Bill.
Operator: We'll go to the line of David Anderson of JPMorgan.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: Just a quick question for Simon, or it's about -- in your release, you've mentioned a $0.05 gain of inventory adjustments. I assume that is mostly North America. If so, did that contribute to the sequential market margin gain this quarter, North America? Just trying to get ahead on how sustainable these margins are?
Simon Ayat: No, this is actually related to the Smith integration. That's not only North America. It's total and it is a step up in inventory that you know it gets amortized over the period of the consumption of the inventory. No, it has no impact on the sequential gain in North America.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: And Andrew, just want to move on to the Middle East. In your comment and your statements, you were talking about gas in the Middle East. And it's pretty obvious, we all know the region is short of gas, but it doesn't seem to really be sense of urgency over there on the part of the NOCs. How do you see that playing out in the next couple of years? And how much of the catalyst can this be for your business do you think?
Andrew Gould: You cannot be talking to the same NOCs as I am, David, because without mentioning names, we see considerable urgency and worry, which is reflected in, for example, in a lot of exploration work that we're doing in one country. And the fact that we are heavily participating in the gas development in another country, so I don't know where you got your information though. I don't see it at all, that way.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: Just in terms of market dynamics in the Middle East. If you go back and we compare it now to late ‘05. How do you see the kind of the overall competition kind of playing out. It seems like some of your competitors have used that downturn to buildout capacity. Are you concerned about, at all, about share losses or do you think that the gas side can more than make up for any kind of capacities that's been built up out there?
Andrew Gould: First, you going to have to identify the share losses for me because we don't see them. We don't make press releases every time we win a contract. And it's not -- the spectacular announcement that we made had been in markets where we didn't participate very much anyway. So we don't see any significant share loss across the Middle East and in fact, in one or two of the new programs we see significant share gains.
Operator: We'll move on to the line of Alan Laws with BMO Capital Markets.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I guess, my first question will be on the international shale here. A commentary on this, or on the opportunities around this sort of dominated your press release and spoken commentary here this morning. Can you talk about the expectations here, maybe in the areas of the regional growth and maybe how this may affect your expectations or relative growth in mix, a D&E versus completion services?
Andrew Gould: I was very careful to say in the commentary that the principal activity in unconventional gas, not shale. Unconventional gas in the international market for the next year or so is going to be in tight gas that is low permeability formation. That is pretty general across the Eastern hemisphere, particularly in North Africa and Middle East, to some extent in Russia. And coal-bed methane, which is essentially Australia. The international shale gas activity, which is going on at the moment can be classified very much as exploration activity as opposed to development because, as for the reasons I mentioned before, there is no way that the overseas people can mobilized the land or the infrastructure or the environmental constraints the same way as in the United States. And therefore, they're going to be much more careful before they go into full scale development. And in terms of unconventional gas develop -- or shale gas exploration overseas, we have a very high participation. The essential places where this is taking place at the moment are Poland, Argentina, India, Algeria and China. And tight gas would be the Middle East, and Russia, and to a certain extent, North Africa.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So it's big D&E late in activity still?
Andrew Gould: Look, you're not going to get me to say the international market is going to go to the same fracing solutions as the U.S. because they won't. Yes, it's drilling and evaluations at the moment. Fracing will always be a part of it and therefore, fracing is important once they've done their D&E to see how these wells are actually going to flow, but it is not going to be on the scale of the U.S.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: My follow-up is international pricing question. When you look at your current spare capacity and notionally, that of your peers, how long do you think it will take to absorb this capacity to a point where pricing becomes a material contributor?
Andrew Gould: I've always said that it doesn't depend on the capacity. It depends on the rate of acceleration in activity. Therefore, the significant pricing traction in services that all the principal oilfield service companies can provide to take place would require a much greater activity increase that we see at this point in time. And I suspect that if it does happen, it's going to be because oil prices are sustained roundabout $90 to $100 into 2012.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Doug Becker with Bank of America.
Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch: Andrew, you've highlighted a number of times that new technology introductions will accelerate in late 2011 and 2012. I generally think of new technology, just introduced over the last 5 years, accounting for about 30% of revenue in any given year. Is just in the ballpark for Schlumberger? Is that revenue mix of new technology for Schlumberger, whatever that is, meaningfully below normal right now given the downturn in 2009 and in 2010?
Andrew Gould: Yes, it's been meaningfully below the normal. And therefore, the acceleration in the rate of which we introduced will be a meaningful increment.
Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch: Andrew, is that 30% figure in the ballpark?
Andrew Gould: No, it's a little high. For the oilfield services industry. But, in fact, if this is a very -- has been difficult area because everyone puts their own metric on what they call new technology.
Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch: Switching to Mexico. Still seeing weakness in that market. Are there any signs of a meaningful recovery in 2011 and what do you see the implications of the performance-based contracts in Mexico being for Schlumberger?
Andrew Gould: I think the there is -- in my mind, there is considerable uncertainty around how the PEMEX budget gets spent in 2011. I don't think it's necessarily going to be exactly what was laid out. And therefore, we remain very cautious on the overall level of activity in Mexico. We think it will be good in the South. We think there'll be some improvement offshore. But as far as the North is concerned, we were quite reluctant to be anything, other than very conservative. In terms of the performance contracts, the only ones that have been let out so far is so small, that I don't think they are great interest to us and possibly not the other service companies. I think the first wave will probably go to local Mexican companies. And obviously, we will be bidding with local Mexican companies to provide the services necessary to execute the contracts. I think that the first wave is to test the system and the really interesting ones will come later.
Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch: And later being potentially 2012?
Andrew Gould: Yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Andrew, could you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing specifically in Iraq and Russia? On Iraq, obviously, you had high start up of cost in Q4. Do you expect that to continue into Q1, as well as Q2, and thus, the margins as for the rest of the year generally? And then on Russia, activity growth outlook for 2011 and color on the Asia the duration asset swap as and when you're getting traction in the region?
Andrew Gould: So on Iraq, our revenue in the fourth quarter was closer to $50 million than $10 million. We have three rigs drilling for BP. We are currently mobilizing three rigs for Exxon Mobil. We are providing services to a number of other customers on a callout basis and on a discrete basis. We have inherited some business from Smith in Kurdistan. So we will have further start up cost in Q1, but we are optimistic that we will break even in Q1, be profitable in Q2, and we will, with careful contract management, have an ambition to be in double-digit margins by the end of the year.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: And on Russia?
Andrew Gould: Russia? Western Siberia will have a better year. Sakhalin will have some slowdown because basically one of our customers is doing a six-month rig move. And the rest of it, Eastern Siberia I think we'll continue to see some good exploration and development in some of the new fields. So overall Russia will have a better year than it did in 2010. But not a gangbusters year because of the slowing in Sakhalin.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: And then as unrelated follow-up, you mentioned in the press release, you're seeing revenue synergies from Smith and specifically, you mentioned drill bits in Brazil. Where else are you seeing revenue synergies, as far by product line or region? And are you seeing traction with PathFinder internationally?
Andrew Gould: Well, the answer is all over. And actually, again, I would much rather that we gave you a comprehensive update at the Investor Day in February, and then, piecemeal stuff now. But synergies are all over.
Operator: The next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz with Weeden.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research: In the press release, you talked about stronger growth rates as the year unfolds. How should we think about the trajectory? I think that comment refers to international growth and related to your comment earlier about pricing being tied to the pace of growth?
Andrew Gould: I think that the best proxy for the growth rate going through the year is going to be the rates which you see offshore rigs either coming in the service as new builds or being contracted after the existing fleet. Because as I said in answer to an earlier question, we could see a lot of inquiries but the rigs don't yet have contracts, so it's likely to be second-half.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research: You've also mentioned several times the expectation of increased exploration activity. You've made these comments, forecast before. It doesn't seem like they've necessarily come to fruition in the past. What's your confidence level on this increase in exploration activity?
Andrew Gould: I was extremely confident last year until Macondo. Macondo, as I said before, put significant delays all over the world, not because people abandoned programs, but because everybody wanted to check their rigs before they proceeded. We think most of the Macondo delay is behind us, outside the United States. And that the number of rig years from new builds in 2011 is significantly higher than in 2010. So my confidence level is the fact that I hope to God we don't have another Macondo, and the fact that -- so that the inefficiencies that came overseas because of Macondo has been absorbed. And because the number of new deepwater rigs as being added is higher this year than it was in 2010.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research: And if I could add just one more question directed to Simon. You gave us a 2011 tax rate guidance. I wondered if you could give us a sense, and just kind of rough estimate of what the pro forma tax rate for Schlumberger would've been if you would own Smith for the entirety of 2010? The question is really, mid 20s, it seems like you're kind of expecting North America contribution to be at or maybe even slightly above what it was in 2010, which doesn't seem to be consistent with the other commentary. But I don't have a pro forma for the combination with Smith.
Simon Ayat: Geoff, I don't think you can conclude on our growth rates from a tax rate. But to answer your question obviously, if we had Smith for the whole year, it will be higher because the Smith is a US-based source income. We do see the mix, I mean, as you know, the U.S. source income during 2010 increased gradually. So in 2011, we'll continue at the same pace, and obviously, that's the result of the increased effective tax rate. It's both the mix of revenues, not only from North America but other places as well and the Smith. I said it's hard to reconcile where the growth rate is coming compared to the tax rate, that is the element of Smith, yes.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research: What I was saying is we shouldn't assume that higher tax rate necessarily means higher North American contributions.
Andrew Gould: No, because of the heritage Smith. The other thing, Geoff is that Simon will of course be gradually restructuring throughout the year in such a way that we tried to minimize the effect of the fact that Smith is a U.S. It is very difficult for him to predict exactly what the tax rate's going to be this year.
Operator: And our final question for today comes from Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: I guess, Andrew, I guess close with North America margins, the nice improvement in the quarter and even excluding that one-time win. But you're still below your largest competitor. Is there still more upside, do you think? And then secondarily, where do you need, because your guys are so strong in the deep gulf, need, really some normalization before you can get margins back to the mid 20s or maybe even better?
Andrew Gould: We still have upsides certainly through the first quarter. You are probably correct in that for us. Our margins to be considerably better than our principal competitors, we need the [indiscernible] back.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: And there's a little bit of your normal, whatever skepticism about sustainability in North America in the comments, as you're allocating CapEx, there's some of these bigger plays with a fairly pretty robust budget for '11. Is there a kind of a contingency for the second half that you're going to wait and see in certain areas before putting additional frac crews or directional crews into specific markets that might even cause you a little bit of share? I'm just wondering how you're handling?
Andrew Gould: We got caught out on the way up by our organization. And we have reorganized in such a way that we understood. We now fairly understand what we're managing and how we're managing it. And you can assume that the true test of the systems that we put in place will actually be on the downside rather than the upside. So without wanting to tell you exactly what we plan, I can tell you that we have a very robust planning system to deal with any rollover in activity in North America.
John Olaisen - Carnegie Investment Bank AB: So you think you have more flexibility, in terms of managing your rollover?
Andrew Gould: Much more. All right, on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. Julie will now provide some closing comments.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Schlumberger earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2010 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris, where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the results and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements, we will welcome your questions. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. And now I will turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter income was $0.68 per share. Excluding the charges in prior periods, this is an increase of $0.06 sequentially and flat as compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we began to see the early effects of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The impact of the moratorium on Oilfield Services resulted in a reduction of Schlumberger's Q2 earnings of approximately $0.02 per share. We anticipate the moratorium earnings impact for the second half of 2010 to be approximately $0.08 to $0.12 per share.  Turning to the business segments. Oilfield Services second quarter revenue increased 7% sequentially, while WesternGeco revenue increased 1%. The growth in Oilfield Services revenue was largely attributable to a surge in activity and increased pricing in U.S. Land, the post-winter seasonal rebound in Russia and increased activity in Mexico/Central America and the North Sea. The acquisition of Geoservices during the quarter also added to revenue. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the spring breakup in Canada, the previously mentioned early effects of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced activity in the North Africa GeoMarket.  Oilfield Services pretax operating income of $1.07 billion increased 11% compared to the prior quarter, while pretax operating margin increased 75 basis points to 19.8%. The increase in margin was primarily driven by a strong performance in North America. International margins increased slightly to 22.4%.  By area, Oilfield Services sequential pretax operating margin highlights were as follows: In North America, pretax operating margin improved 237 basis points to 10.4%. Within North America, U.S. Land margin improved significantly by 15 percentage points as a result of higher activity and pricing for Well Services technologies. However, this increase was tempered by lower margin in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from the early effects of the deepwater drilling moratorium and reduced margins in the Canada due to spring breakup.  Latin America margin increased 35 basis points to 17.9%, primarily due to the increased activity in the Mexico/Central America and Argentina/Bolivia/Chile GeoMarkets. However, as noted in the press release, we anticipate a slowdown of activity in Mexico, and we will subsequently have an associated charge in Q3. Europe/CIS/Africa margin increased 29 basis points to 18.4%, as the positive impact of the seasonal rebound in activity in Russia and a more favorable revenue mix in the North Sea offset the impact of reduced revenue in the Western South Africa and North Africa GeoMarkets. Middle East/Asia margin remains strong at 31.1%.  Sequentially, WesternGeco pretax operating income decreased 31% to $47 million, and pretax operating margins slipped 447 basis points to 9.8%, primarily due to a decrease in monthly client sales and lower revenue combined with the startup costs for Land. These decreases were partially offset by improved productivity in Marine. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate was 17.8%. This was lower than last quarter, primarily due to a more favorable geographic earnings mix in WesternGeco. As you are aware, the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic earnings mix and as such, we do experience some volatility on a quarterly basis.  Net debt was $766 million at the end of the quarter as compared to $75 million at the end of the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion of cash and investments on hand and short-term debt of only $719 million. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1 billion relating to the acquisition of Geoservices, $634 million of CapEx, $535 million of stock repurchases and the conversion of $297 million of outstanding debentures into 7.4 million shares of common stock. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.4 million shares at an average price of $63.33. We repurchased the maximum number of shares we could under the SEC Safe Harbor provisions in light of the pending merger with Smith. Oilfield Services CapEx is still expected to reach approximately $2.8 billion for 2010, while WesternGeco CapEx is expected to be approximately $335 million.  And now, I turn the conference over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould: Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. Schlumberger's second quarter revenue of $5.94 billion or 6% higher sequentially and 7% higher year-on-year. The sequential revenue increases recorded in all Oilfield Service areas, led by strong performances in both North and Latin America. Among the technologies, sequential revenue growth was strongest in Well Services, primarily due to stronger U.S. Land activity in pricing, increased product sales in the Middle East and a seasonal rebound in Russia.  In North America, surging activity and improved pricing in the U.S. Land GeoMarket more than offset the combined effects of the Canadian spring breakup and the start of the drilling moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that began late in the quarter. In Latin America, Mexico grew on higher activity and stronger Integrated Project Management activity, while Brazil continued to see a buildup in offshore exploration activity.  In Europe/CIS/Africa, the effects of a strong post-winter rebound in Russia and improve activity in the North Sea drove revenue growth, although these effects were partially offset by lower activity in North Africa and lower exploration services in West Africa. In Middle East/Asia, most GeoMarkets saw higher activity with strong demand for Wireline Services boosted by higher sales of Well Services product and Artificial Lift equipment.  In the Middle East, Integrated Project Management services diversified further, as our presence increased in Iraq and preparations began to pud the first well in the Rumaila field with the first of the three rigs planned. The second and third rigs will follow, we see continuing increases in Iraq activity throughout the rest of the year.  The WesternGeco revenue is sequentially flat with strong increases in Marine and data processing were insufficient to overcome the effect of reduced multi-client activity mainly in North America, following the traditionally strong first quarter sales and in Land, following the completion of a contract in the Middle East. New technologies continue to contribute to the overall performance particularly in Well Services, while a number of new contract awards underpinned future progress. In particular, I would mention the award by Petrobras of two new stimulation vessels, would represent the return of Schlumberger to the Brazilian vessel stimulation marketplace after a long absence. In a similar move in Mexico, an award of a vessel from PEMEX will give us a strong presence in the country's offshore stimulation market. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we see a continued slow build of activity in the second half in most parts of the world.  U.S. Land, Brazil, the North Sea, Russia and the Middle East and Asia will be areas of continued strength. This will be partially offset by reductions in IPM [Integrated Project Management] activity in Mexico, in both Chicontepec and Burgos. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are not planning for any resumption of drilling activity this year. In deepwater activity elsewhere, we have not seen nor do we expect to see any significant delays or program reductions as a result of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium. Internationally, operators, contractors and regulatory bodies have stepped up maintenance and verification of key well control equipment and procedures, but have not restricted actual drilling activity. The outlook for WesternGeco will be governed by the evolution of the multi-client market in the Gulf of Mexico, which remains uncertain at this time. At Schlumberger, we began a program three years ago called Excellence in Execution. This program was designed to create a step change in the service quality and efficiency we provide. And in deepwater, we aim at enabling our customers to reduce the risk and cost of their deepwater operations. The program, in addition to equipment and procedure improvements, provides the competency certification of all our personnel involved in deepwater operations. We are encouraged by the results, as well as our customers' acceptance of this multiyear initiative. We believe that the contribution of deepwater discoveries has been and will remain very significant to future hydrocarbon production. We therefore welcome the current efforts to better understand and control the risks associated with these types of operations. While additional control and oversight will undoubtedly add costs, we expect this will be offset in the long run by improvements in operating procedures and technology. The recovery in world demand for oil had been reasonably robust, and current forecast for the coming year remain consistent with slowly increasing levels of exploration and production activity. Natural gas economics remain more challenging, the supply of both LNG and unconventional gas in the U.S. would appear to continue to outstrip the demand recovery. Overall, therefore, we see the current trend of a slow but sure recovery in activity, as likely to continue without a change until we have a clearer view of the sustainability of the recovery in the world economy. Finally, as an update on our proposed merger with Smith International, our view has not changed that the merger will close in the third quarter of this year. The closing remains subject to clearance by the U.S. Department of Justice, clearance by the European Commission, approval by Smith International stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions. I would only add that the annual meeting of the Smith International stockholders has been announced for August 24.  And I will now turn the call back to Julie.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] With that, we'll go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: My initial question here is given the recent changes and the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and a lot of the regulation and other types of concerns, does this at all alter your -- it doesn't sound like it, but I'd like to hear it again, does this alter your viewpoint of the deepwater growth prospects? Does it alter your strategy on how you're going to try and attack that market?
Andrew Gould: So I think the first thing to say is, in the last three years, somewhere between 40% and 50% of the new field discoveries have been in deepwater. Deepwater production has been scheduled to become 10 million barrels a day by 2015, so that's approaching 10% of world supply. And it's a bigger supply than almost any country apart from three. So I think it's highly unlikely that apart from some delays caused by proper caution and control, that there is any significant reduction in deepwater activity anywhere. And I find it extremely interesting that both Norway and the U.K. have permitted some of the deepest water wells they've ever drilled since the Gulf of Mexico moratorium was put on. So I don't think this is going to significantly slow deepwater in the medium to long term. I do think that the issue of spill response is something the industry has to address, I was pleased to see what the majors put out yesterday. And in terms of ourselves, I feel extremely comfortable because as I pointed out in the press release, we've made a huge effort to understand the risks of what we do in deepwater and to specifically train our people to be aware of those risks and to react to them. So after a brief pause in the Gulf of Mexico, I don't see any reason to change our strategy in deepwater, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: Along the lines of the Smith, it sounds like things there are clearly progressing very well, maybe even ahead of your initial expectations, so I don't want to put words in your mouth. It doesn't appear to me like the Street is really giving you any credit or paying much attention to what Smith may bring to the overall organization. I was wondering if you share that view and if so, what do you think we're all missing?
Andrew Gould: Well, I don't know whether the Street understand or appreciate what it will bring to Schlumberger or not. But, I mean, I like to do things sometimes by anecdotal example. So we presented the Smith strategy to our Board of Directors on Tuesday, and they all came out very excited. And on Wednesday morning, I got an e-mail from the manager of one of the countries in the Middle East, where under the current new rig assignments, six rigs have been taken away from our competitors and given to us on the basis that we drill faster, and that was without Smith. So I'm extremely bullish on what Smith is going to do for us, once we start to integrate the different drilling services they have with the drilling services that we have.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: Would you like to offer up what country that was?
Andrew Gould: No. I'm afraid I wouldn't, Kurt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Andrew, you highlight strong performance in North America, and then we look at your margins and compare them with other companies that have reported so far and there's clearly a big gap. And I mean, that's just, of course, due a bit some way on mix. But you seem to put in place in the organization, can you just outline the road map to getting your North American business to kind of close the gap at some way over at your peers?
Andrew Gould: I think that perhaps the thing to say is that the improvement in our U.S. Land margins in Q2 was purely through activity and pricing and without any effects of the reorganization, though a lot of the reorganization work was taking place. And therefore, I would remind everybody that we said we would take a restructuring charge associated with North America in Q3, and that is still the intention, but it won't be very large. But the effects of the restructuring will only start to flow through to the margins in the third and fourth quarters. And therefore, we continue to expect to see outside the constraints of activity and pricing improvements in our cost structure and efficiency in North America through the balance of the year.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Historically, or not historically, but you've previously alluded to the fact that there must be smarter way of doing shale and unconventional than brute horsepower. Could you update us to your latest thoughts there, and whether any new technology has any way of playing into your strategy in North America?
Andrew Gould: So I think we are much closer, I'm not going to announce what we'll be doing over the sound waves, Ole. But I think we're much closer to understanding the technology set that we think is appropriate to improving our capacity to predict the productivity of shale from measurements. And if we do that, this is not going to happen this year, it's going to take a little time. If we can do that, then eventually, it will start to change the technology set that is used to produce shale. But it's not this year, Ole. But I think, we are much closer to defining what we think that technology set will be.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So we shouldn't expect you to put as reason, go and massively increase your capacity or horsepower for example?
Andrew Gould: No.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Second question would be on Middle East, impressive margins. You're building up in Iraq. Could you -- as Iraq gets going and you get beyond the startup costs, will Iraq be accretive or dilutive or neutral to your Middle East margins?
Andrew Gould: It's going to be negative to our Middle East margins overall in 2010, and I think it will balance out in 2011.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Are you already taking substantial startup costs there?
Andrew Gould: We're taking startup costs, I wouldn't call them huge. We haven't identified them but they are in the margin in Q2.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell with Barclays Capital.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital: Andrew, my first question is about your Seismic business. Can you talk about, first, the outlook for the Multi-Client business over the rest of the year?
Andrew Gould: I can only give you the known, unknown, Jim. So the first question is, is the moratorium extended beyond six months? I don't think so, but we don't know yet. We haven't been granted a seismic permit since the moratorium came on to keep the boat working. The big question is going to be whether the March 2011 Eastern Gulf or Central Gulf lease sale takes place or gets postponed, and I could see a very good case for the new BOE [Bureau of Ocean Energy] actually postponing it. There are two next year. The other one being in August. If it's just a postponement, then it will be a postponement of revenue rather than a cancellation. We honestly don't know whether or not the moratorium in the traditional ramp up of Multi-Client sales at the end of the year is going to have a positive or negative effect. If the future of exploration drilling in the Gulf is still very uncertain in November, it's going to have a negative effect. If the rules will become clearer, then maybe some of our customers will be tempted to buy some data with some of the budget they haven't used for other things. But today, it's almost impossible to say, which way that will go. We have not seen any signs or we don't have any indication that third-party Marine inactivity in the Gulf is going to be any different. But on Multi-Client, until the situation on the future exploration drilling becomes clearer, it's extremely difficult to predict what's going to happen, Jim.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital: And if we saw the negative outcome in the Gulf of Mexico persistent to 2011, would you be markedly more cautious on your outlook for better pricing in the Vessel business for 2011 that I think you articulated last quarter?
Andrew Gould: So the good news in the Vessel business is despite the Gulf of Mexico, the capacity is still being absorbed. And you're quite right to point out that the question will be, once the capacity is absorbed, if there's no big shooting market, acquisition market in the Gulf of Mexico, will pricing move ahead in 2011? And I have to say, if that is the case, I doubt there would be much pricing leverage.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital: Andrew, has your view on whether divestitures will be required as a result of the Smith acquisition change since you announced the acquisition?
Andrew Gould: I can't comment on that, Jim.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital: And lastly, do you see yourself having a presence in the Gulf of Mexico Stimulation business in the intermediate to longer term?
Andrew Gould: It's not high on our priorities.
Operator: Next question is from Daniel Boyd with Goldman Sachs & Co. (sic) [Goldman Sachs].
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just a question on the margins in Europe/CIS/Africa. It sounds like from your comments that mix played a part in pretty, almost flattish margins sequentially. How should we think about margins over the next couple of quarters? Always tough to predict mix, but should we see a nice step up there, as sort of mix normalizes, so to speak?
Andrew Gould: There are some issues in the mix that we can predict and some that we can't. So the one we can predict, for example, is that in Q2 a lot of the rigs, the offshore rigs were on completion and not drilling. And when this happens, the revenue swings in favor of our competitors rather than us and when they're on drilling, it swings in our favor. So logically, they should swing back to drilling in Q3, which will help. And the exploration success, a lot of the prospects that were being drilled in the second quarter were fairly marginal, quite deliberately fairly marginal on the part of our customers. And the question is, if they swing back to more really perspective exploration in Q3, will that improve the mix or not? But that one is extremely difficult to predict. And North Africa, I think we will probably not see much improvement.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then just one follow-up on North America and U.S. Land, it's come up quite a bit in terms of long-term contracts, I guess, especially for stimulation equipment. Are you seeing those? And what are you thoughts on Schlumberger participating in signing long-term contracts?
Andrew Gould: Well, yes, we're seeing customers making inquiries. But as my peers pointed out, long-term contracts don't really mean very much in North America, so we're not in a hurry to sign over at this point.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And similar to that, are you also of the thought process that you don't want those margins or returns to get too attractive in North America to prevent potential overcapacity building again?
Andrew Gould: I think that the argument that we all have to be conscious of is the argument that what is the correct return on the capital for pressure pumping, and not to let pricing go to the point where the return on capital is so high that it's going to attract a lot of competition, yes, I agree.
Operator: The next questions from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William Herbert - Simmons: Andrew, with regards your international growth prospects or international prospects in general, you mentioned sort of a steady improvement from this point forward with most regions partially offset by what's going on in Mexico. Relative to your perspective of the Q1 or on the Q1 call, which regions internationally are likely to show a more restrained rate of growth relative to what you thought was a case a quarter ago other than Mexico?
Andrew Gould: I think that we would say that Latin America, and the rest of Latin America is fine, sorry. So ECA, [Europe/CIS/Africa] I would say that we think the offshore market has slipped by one quarter. So the improvement that we thought we would have in Q2 will come in Q3, et cetera, et cetera, which means that overall, my view of ECA for the year probably hasn't changed very much. If it has, it's a slight negative bias, basically because of North Africa not West Africa. On the other hand, if I had to change my bias for MEA, for Middle East/Asia, it would be slightly more positive than it was at the end of Q1, but skewed towards the end of the year.
William Herbert - Simmons: So really net-net, other than Mexico on balance, no real change from what you thought was the case in Q1?
Andrew Gould: Not really, no. A little bit of a shift away from Africa towards Asia but apart from that, not really. And of course, Mexico is worse than we thought at the end of Q1 but apart from that, no.
William Herbert - Simmons: You mentioned economic uncertainty with regard to perhaps tempering customer appetites a bit. We know it's early, but as you look into 2011, do you hazard a guess with providing us with a framework for international growth?
Andrew Gould: I still think that the international growth for oil stems very much off GDP. So if you look at the latest forecast, they're talking about a 4.3% instead of 4.7% in 2011. If that turns out to be the case, I think the oil price will be very healthy and international oil will be good in 2011. If the GDP growth rate slips back then it will affect it consequentially.
William Herbert - Simmons: Next subject here is Gulf of Mexico and I know that this is a tough question to ask, but just a conceptual one. We had a 30-rig floater market before the spill, likely growing to 40 to 45 rigs. Now we had the spill, and the likely results are going to be increased costs, increased regulation and generally speaking at a given commodity price, probably lower rates of return for the industry in general E&P industry in deepwater Gulf of Mexico midsize and large independents getting marginalized, and really probably becoming the exclusive province of the super major. You went from a 30-rig market, which was the second largest market in the world likely going to, I don't know, something smaller going forward based upon the return profile getting impaired. I don't know what that number is, 15, 20 rigs, but looking more like Norway as opposed to the Gulf of Mexico. You've conveyed a sense of no real change in strategy, but I'm just curious as to your Gulf of Mexico footprint and cost structure. As you look out over the next couple of years, what should we expect to see?
Andrew Gould: Actually, I think that the issue you're raising is not the issue of the additional cost. I think the issue that you're raising, which is the very real issue that our customers will have a great deal of difficulty coming to terms with is what is the ultimate viability going to be; people who own leases in the Gulf of Mexico because that's the thing that will limit the number of operators, not the cost. And so we actually have transferred out something like 200 people to U.S. Land and to other places, and we have loaned 250-odd very skilled engineers, operators, maintenance technicians to other deepwater theaters around the world. So we have actually retained the potential to come back as and when we are asked to come back. And some of this has been in close cooperation with our customers who don't want that potential destroyed. I agree with you that the market is not going to be the 45 rigs that people were talking about as little as four or five months ago. I don't know that it's going to be 15 to 20 because I don't think you're going to be able to define that until you actually know how the liability is going to be defined. There is a risk that you quite rightly point out that this becomes limited to the super majors and perhaps people with national government backing, but I think it's a little too early to assume that. So for the moment, we're doing our best to get the Gulf of Mexico to break even by lending out people and equipment. That's going to be very tough in Q3, and then after that, we'll look and see how it looks afterwards. Now in the longer term, I think that people will adapt their deepwater programs to other theaters where, perhaps, they feel they have a more clement regulatory climate in which to drill. And I don't know whether you looked at the Financial Times yesterday, but there was a very good summary of all the reactions so far around the world in different regulatory bodies to this. And there isn't one yet that has taken and, obviously, they don't have the emotional problem that the U.S. does, has taken such a firm stand against deepwater, and I very much doubt they will.
William Herbert - Simmons: Simon, could you share with us what the margin improvement was in U.S. Land quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter?
Simon Ayat: From the first quarter to the second quarter was 15 percentage points.
William Herbert - Simmons: U.S. Land?
Simon Ayat: U.S. Land improved by 15 percentage points.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Pickering with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Daniel Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Andrew, with a lot of moving parts in North America, I heard you talk about taking charge of reorganization, et cetera. I guess I'm just curious, Gulf of Mexico is going to have a full quarter of impact. I assume that means third quarter margins will be down as well as the second. And I'm thinking about how we bounce back from that given cost cuts, et cetera, earned, do you think you'll exit the year -- in other words, Q4 margins are kind of in line with this Q2 level or even better? Or is it going to be tough to get back to these levels by the year end?
Andrew Gould: So I mean, the moving parts that we have, Dan, I mean, I have very little -- I have no doubt that U.S. Land margins will continue to improve provided the rig count holds up. Canada will undoubtedly improve from now on because Canada Q2 is there is spring breakup. So the unknown is at what stage can we get the Gulf of Mexico to the point where it's not diluted to the overall U.S. margin. And in Q3, it will be diluted, there's no doubt about it. We haven't had enough time to do all the transfers, the loans, moving of equipment that is necessary to get the Gulf of Mexico to close to break even. So I think you can assume that in Q3, there is a possibility that the effect of the Gulf of Mexico on the other moving parts is to slightly dilute the margin compared to Q2, slightly. But in Q4, I've no doubt that it will rebound, and I think that it will be -- unless something dramatic happens in the Gulf, and that it will be above the levels -- we'll exit the year above the levels we've shown so far this year.
Daniel Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: And then as we think about the Seismic business, can you remind us again of how much the Gulf of Mexico represents of Multiclient sales and if we think about Q3 and given what's going on in the Gulf of Mexico, is that going to be a break-even business overall Seismic in the third quarter or should it be better than that?
Andrew Gould: I think it'll be slightly better than breakeven, Dan, but below Q2 partly because of transits and partly because, as you point out, of lower Multiclient.
Daniel Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: And overall margins for Schlumberger, your thought has been in the Q1 call that Schlumberger margins were going to make a fairly steady upward progression through the year. I mean, given all the moving parts again, Andrew, you see them better than we do obviously, do we manage to continue that? Do you reiterate that [indiscernible] (54:17) level of margins in the second half?
Andrew Gould: Can we leave Seismic out of that as we just discussed that? So x seismic, the two things that have changed since I made the statement in Q1 is number one, Gulf of Mexico and number two, the fairly dramatic reduction that's being announced in activity in Mexico. If you extract those two things, I don't change my statements in Q1.
Operator: The next question comes from David Anderson with JPMorgan.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: Just want to ask you a question about Russia. Russian activities ticked up pretty good this year, even beyond the seasonal recovery. In light of your very good position over there, I just want to get your sense of the sustainability of this market in the next 12 months? And how concerned are you about the new taxes that are being put in place there? Q3 focused entirely on natural gas, so I guess a sense of your oil gas mix over there will be very helpful.
Andrew Gould: Well, we don't have a big gas presence in Russia, except in the very high end. So I don't think that, that'll have a dramatic effect. You're quite right that the seasonal rebound in Russia was very strong, and we think that, that will continue through the balance of the summer, and the question always becomes what is the seasonal effect of the winter going to be like next year. And as to the situation for oil with tax, I think you would just need to watch what happens to the overall level of Russian production, and that will very much govern what happens next year.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: On a different subject, going on to Brazil. Last quarter's call, you had talked about that giant sucking sound [ph] (56:07) came out of the Middle East last cycle that drove earnings growth and you were sure that's going to come from this time. In your release today, you highlighted a couple of new stimulation vessels you're putting in there and it just would seem to me that over the next five years, with the deepwater activity down in Brazil that, that could very well be where that sucking sound [ph] comes from this cycle. Do you view it that way? How long do you think that takes to play out or kind of the competitive dynamics different here that makes this a different market for the Middle East in terms of Schlumberger...
Andrew Gould: No, I don't think the competitive dynamics is different. What is different is the speed with the ramp up. In other words, in Middle East, the Saudi ramp up took place over an incredibly short period of time. I mean, they basically ramped up three huge projects in the space of three years. There's no way that in an offshore development like Brazil that they can possibly ramp up at the same speed. And therefore, while you're quite right that the markets are going to go on increasing and growing very fast, it will never create, I don't need to create the sucking effect that Saudi Arabia created when they went into their big development projects.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: On WesternGeco, I think you guys were projecting somewhere around 50 3D vessels to be in the global market by the end of the year and maybe a dozen or so on the sidelines. How any of those were you projecting to be in the Gulf of Mexico? And how should we be thinking about if we don't get another lease sale in the next 12 months, which who knows, but if you get three or four or five vessels leaving the market, won't that throw the whole global seismic market into disarray?
Andrew Gould: I don't know the answer to your question. As to the precise number of the new vessels we projected going to the Gulf -- talked to [ph] (57:54) WesternGeco this morning, certainly on the basis of the vessel count, they know between now and the end of the year, they are not concerned about utilization.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: But 2011, wild card?
Andrew Gould: 2011, it's just impossible to know until we have clarity on future exploration activity in the Gulf of Mexico.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alan Laws of BMO Capital Markets.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I'm going to ask you about the North American market here. Maybe I'm reading into this, but your tone on the U.S. Land seems less pessimistic than it has maybe in the past. Is that a function of your restructuring or changes in your view of the fundamentals and/or maybe demand dynamics? And are you seeing any evidence of investment being swung onshore from the Gulf at this point?
Andrew Gould: I mean, the answer to that is no. I haven't seen any major move in investment onshore though they well may be some, particularly with the independents. My view of the fundamentals of gas, I'm sorry, is I'm still puzzled because gas supply is still outstripping the recovery in demand. And the question is I hear all these reasons why people are drilling, but the question is how long is that going to last? And the only assumption I've made, Alan, is it's going to last for the rest of this year. Beyond that, I'm not making any predictions.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So essentially, you're going to take the high-level activity and pocket that and then see what happens?
Andrew Gould: Exactly. We're not going to just leave it.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: The other thing, last quarter, you'd mentioned decline in deepwater rig rates as a potential catalyst for exploration spending. With kind of recent events, it seems that this may accelerate. Is it too early to expect to see any signs of increased demand for Seismic beyond 2010? And comment maybe, I guess, on how do you think the cycle for Seismic might unfold over the next 18 months?
Andrew Gould: I don't think that lower rig rates will affect Seismic because most of our customers, particularly the big ones overseas, have portfolios that will allow them to generate exploration drilling prospects without shooting additional seismic. I think the question is at what stage will they be tempted by lower rig rates to increase exploration programs, and I don't think you'll see much of that in 2010. But if the oil price is decent and the rig rates are low, you may well see something of that in 2011.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: What's the level of oil price to incite the incremental Seismic? Does that need to be 80 or 70 and up?
Andrew Gould: Well, I think it's bouncing towards 80 instead of bouncing all the time toward 70, Alan.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Quick question on the Middle East. It's been interesting to watch the rig count come down and counting [ph] (1:01:36) come back as you pointed out they were a big driver for growth in that region in the previous cycle. What are we seeing in terms of mix shift that's allowing your revenues and margins to hold up?
Andrew Gould: Exploration and deep and toxic gas development.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: In Saudi and UAE?
Andrew Gould: Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, to a lesser extent in Oman, it's tight. It's not particularly toxic. And then actually, exploration's been good in the far -- it was very good in the Far East in Q1, slightly weaker in Q2, but we expect to rebound in the second half of the year.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: The reason for the question, I think, is we talked about gas in the global markets, obviously, LNG creating looseness in the international market and we know it's gone on in the U.S. There are pockets where you have countries that are short gas and short power in particular as you pointed out Saudi being...
Andrew Gould: And when they produced domestic gas, it's normally to substitute oil so it releases oil for export, not in Saudi, obviously, but in other countries.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: If I think about India, there's another market that's very short power and looking to develop gas. It's just the country has not been talked about much in the last couple of quarters. I'm just wondering if you could speak to what's going on in that market.
Andrew Gould: I think there's a fairly steady long exploration process that's taking place offshore, and actually there is some interesting work going on on onshore, in gas, particularly even some work in shale gas. So yes, the interest of India in gas is rising, Michael. But apart from the offshore development, I don't think there's anything major yet that they're putting into development.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Is it something that maybe we could see a step up in the next 12 months or is it further out, do you think?
Andrew Gould: I think it's probably -- I think there's a lot of work to be done before they know exactly what they want to do.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Switching to U.S. Land, you've mentioned I think on the Smith conference call that we would be moving towards drilling geologically as opposed to geometrically. I heard anecdotes...
Andrew Gould: Drilling and completing.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Drilling and completing. I've heard anecdotes that some of these bigger fracs and close proximity wells is that you're getting fluid invasion from one or the other and sort of problems with just sort of getting bigger and louder, so to speak, with the frac. I'm wondering if that kind of trend is actually going to be an accelerant to exactly what you're talking about, drilling geologically.
Andrew Gould: I can't speak to fluid invasion. I don't know. I'll find out, but I don't know. What I can speak to is in these large fracs, the percentage of perforation that actually produce is quite low, and obviously, the more percs [ph] (1:05:01) you frac, the more water you use. And therefore, if you can devise a method on it which you only complete with perforations, we're pretty sure we're going to produce, you're going to use less water, and hopefully, you'll have a more productive well. But I think I would re-emphasize that this is a goal. I don't think we're there yet.
Operator: Next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Andrew, given your comments that certainly this recovery is driven by oil activity versus oil and gas, do you believe it's going to be more difficult or take longer before we can push for pricing as it simply will become longer before capacity becomes tight?
Andrew Gould: You're talking of CIS [ph] (1:05:55)?
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: International, right.
Andrew Gould: Yes, it's obviously the slower the rig count climbs, the longer it's going to take. But it's going to be, I think, more selective by service rather than the general sort of shortage that occurred in 2005, 2006. So it's going to depend very much on the nature of activity. Is it exploration, is development, et cetera?
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: And thus, when you think to the product lines or specific regions, where do you believe we could potentially see pricing gains first?
Andrew Gould: Well, I still think that the first signs of shortage, or not shortage, but the first signs of our ability to look at pricing because tighter capacity is going to be in drilling tools, probably. But I mean, it's still early days. It's too early to start really knowing. That's more my feeling than any tangible evidence.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: In certain regions over others?
Andrew Gould: Well, I think it will occur offshore before it occurs on land, put it that way.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: And then when you think about international margins, 2008 you were 29%. Today, we're at 22%. If you think about 2011, is it fair to assume a slow and steady recovery that we would be in the mid-20s or is higher or lower possible?
Andrew Gould: Like I said in answer to an earlier question, there's an $80 oil price that would stimulate considerable activity for oil in 2011. And if that's the case, then I don't think, and I said this before, I don't think we'll get back to the 2008 margins if only because of the mix and the speed with which activity is climbing. But certainly, we will have another margin improvement.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Then finally, when you think about international growth in 2011, as far as year-over-year growth, what are your thoughts there as far as percentage or range?
Andrew Gould: I'm not going to start giving numbers on 2011, international growth in July 2010. Way too early.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: First of all, it's not that good.
Andrew Gould: No.
Operator: Next question is from Geoff Kieburtz with Weeden & Co.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research: Andrew, in responding to earlier question, you seem sort of -- I think I took the message that your view about the kind of multi-period outlook has not really changed since the first quarter with the exception of Gulf of Mexico and Mexico. On the CapEx side, it seems like you're, through the first half, spending considerably below the run rate that your full year outlook would suggest. What's going on there? Why is that?
Andrew Gould: We always do, Geoff. [indiscernible] (1:09:16) stronger. It's nothing new. It's pretty much par for what happens every year because the field wants their CapEx earlier and manufacturing does their best, but they can't necessarily deliver it. So CapEx is always higher in the second half than the first half.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research: Is there any sense that supply chain is starting to become constrained?
Andrew Gould: Generally, no. There are one or two specific bottlenecks that occur because they're very specialized, but they're not really very [indiscernible] (1:09:52). They're not something that stops its progressing.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research: And you've bumped up your WesternGeco CapEx a little bit. It seems a little bit inconsistent with the tone that you've been talking about in the business.
Andrew Gould: It's marginal, I think. I don't know where...
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research: The equity earnings dropped sequentially in the quarter. Why shouldn't we think that's an indication of what's happening at M-I?
Simon Ayat: Well, Geoff, you know the equity line in Schlumberger, it's a mix of several items. There is a bit of impact coming from the deepwater moratorium, I think, on some of our investments, not necessarily on the M-I, but it's a mix. You will always see a bit of a fluctuation.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research: And, Simon, could you give us any guidance? You mentioned in the release that Geoservice did impact revenues somewhat in the quarter? Can you give us any idea of magnitude and/or regions that were impacted?
Simon Ayat: So, Geoff, it's one month as a matter fact. In the month of June, we account for Geoservices on a one-month lag, so it's a one month only that was reported in the second quarter. It's very marginal, and it is spread over most of the areas outside North America, more outside North America than inside North America. And it's a very marginal, really. It's one month only.
Operator: Next question's from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil: Andrew, you talked a lot about your expectations in the deepwater as it relates to the Gulf of Mexico incident and the impact on activity internationally. I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about with people and equipment now making those moves internationally, in some cases, if they're not going to U.S. Land. Can you just talk about the pricing environment whether or not that's got more competitive even if activity stays similar, in your mind, but activity or pricing gets more competitive?
Andrew Gould: So in deepwater, we have not seen, and I do not expect to see on existing contracts any request to revive that pricing because more service capacities become available. I think that people are going to stick with their contracts and worry more about service quality and risk than they do about pricing. As to new bids, we haven't actually submitted very many since this happened, Bill, so I can't give you an intelligent answer. Yes, obviously, pricing will, on new bids, probably suffer a bit. I would reiterate that I think anyone drilling in deepwater these days is not going to want to take risks.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil: Do you expect the length of the contracts, the service contracts, you'll bid in deepwater offshore markets to be similar, Andrew, as a result of this? Or do you think guys will look for shorter as they want to see what the impacts of maybe additional capacity could mean longer term to the market?
Andrew Gould: I think that, in this year, if there is any rebidding or programs that are bid, they're likely to be short term. And we'll only see return to the longer-term commitments next year.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil: As far as the name [ph] (1:13:41) restructuring is concerned, do you think we're done by the end of the third quarter on that? And I guess it was a comment made earlier, but you didn't see any benefit in your 2Q margins from the restructuring. I'm just curious if you can give us an idea, structurally going forward, what kind of basis point margin improvement do you think you can get in your U.S. onshore or your North American as a whole as a result of this restructuring? Is that something you could quantify for us?
Andrew Gould: We think that will be highly competitive with our competitors by the time that we finish as equal mix.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil: Is third quarter pretty much a conclusion of this? Do you think you're done by that point, Andrew?
Andrew Gould: I think a lot will have been achieved by the end of the third quarter, but I think as I originally said, it's 2011.
Operator: We have time for another question and that comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc: Andrew, I wanted to just get your thoughts about the IPM business. Presumably, when Mexico rebounds, that market, as it definitely will, that will play an important role. But is there any change to your thinking about the IPM business model internationally? In terms of the very strong outlook you had and today?
Andrew Gould: No, I think that the only change in the outlook we have for IPM is that it's twofold, actually. First is that the portfolio is becoming much more balanced between Latin America and the rest of the world because it was originally fairly highly concentrated in Latin America; and secondly, there are two types of well construction contracts evolving partly because of Iraq, one of which is the Mexico one, which is, as you know, is very much lump-sum performance-based, not necessarily the most attractive; and the ones in Iraq, which I think will be much more disciplined and more the execution contracts rather than risk contracts.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc: Are there any -- as some national oil companies become increasingly more technologically capable and sophisticated, do you see IPM becoming less important in those countries or more?
Andrew Gould: The long-term objective of IPM from the very beginning was not to drill wells. It was to assist in the management of mature production and the business case for assisting the management in mature production for an oil company, national or otherwise, is that they don't have enough internal capacity to do everything they want to do. And we are seeing encouraging signs that, that shift is beginning to take place. So over the long term, while well construction, I think, will always remain a part of it, packaged well construction, we think that the long-term future is in the management or assisting in the management in mature production.

Operator: Welcome to the Schlumberger Limited earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald; please go ahead, sir.
Malcolm Theobald: Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2010 results conference call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer.  Prior to Andrew's overview of the results and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements we will welcome your questions. Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat : Thank you Malcolm, ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. Excluding charges first quarter income was $0.62 per share. This is down $0.05 sequentially and down $0.16 compared to the same quarter of last year.  During the quarter we recorded $75 million or $0.06 of charges, $40 million related to the reduction of future tax deductions relating to our retiree medical plan as a result of the passage during the quarter of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the US. We also recorded $35 million of merger related transaction costs pertaining to the Smith and Geoservices transactions. We anticipate that we will continue to incur merger and integration related costs. These amounts will be most significant in the quarter when the Smith transaction closes, and the quarters immediately following the merger. We will continue to separately identify these charges for you. Turning to the business segments, oilfield services first quarter revenue decreased 1% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue decreased 14%. The sequential decline in both revenue and earnings per share can be primarily attributed to severe winter weather that hampered activity particularly in Russia, combined with the absence of the surge in multi client SIS software and other product sales that we experienced in Q4.  These declines were partially offset by an improved performance in North America. Oilfield services pre-tax operating income of $969 million decreased 4% compared to the prior quarter. Oilfield services margins slipped by 46 basis points sequentially to 19% as improvement in North America were offset by a decline in Europe/CIS/Africa. Although all international margins in OFS were 22.3%. By area oilfield services sequential pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows. North America improved by 594 basis points to 8% primarily due to an increase in activity across the area supplemented by some pricing improvements for well stimulation services. Latin America increased by 174 basis points to 17.5% mostly as a result of the more favorable revenue mix in Mexico/Central America and the effect of the currency devaluation in Venezuela. Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 18.1%, 353 basis points lower principally due to lower activity in Russia and the North Sea and lower testing services, equipment and SIS software sales. Finally, Middle East/Asia margin declined slightly by 156 basis points to 31% primarily due to less favorable revenue mix in the Arabian, Gulf, Qatar and Indonesia GeoMarkets and the absence of the year end artificial lift product and SIS software sales in Q4. At WesternGeco pre-tax was $67 million reflected the decrease in pre-tax margin of 659 basis points to 14.3%. This decrease was largely attributable to the absence of the strong year-end multi client sales that we experienced last quarter. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole the effective tax rate excluding charges was 18.9%. This was higher than last quarter primarily due to less favorable geographic earning mix in oilfield services. As you are aware the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic earnings mix and as such we do experience some volatility on a quarterly basis.  Net debt was $75 million at the end of the quarter as compared to $126 million at the end of Q4. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and investment on hand and short-term debt of only $934 million.  Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $337 million of stock repurchases and $444 million of CapEx. During the quarter we repurchased 5.3 million shares at an average price of $63.72. Subsequent to the announcement of the merger with Smith in February we repurchased the maximum number of shares we could under the SEC’s Safe Harbor provisions. During the second quarter we are projecting a significant increase in our net debt as a result of the closing of the Geoservices transaction combined with the ramp up in CapEx. These increases would be offset in part by the expected conversion to equity of our $299 million of convertible debentures during Q2. Oilfield services CapEx is now expected to reach approximately $2.8 billion in 2010 while WesternGeco CapEx is still expected to approach $300 million.  And now I’ll turn the conference over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould : Thank you Simon and good morning everybody. Schlumberger first quarter revenues of $5.1 billion registered a marginal sequential decline with a strong performance in North America and continued strength in the Middle East/Asia offset an overall decline in product and software sales in the high levels of the fourth quarter and a sharp drop in the North Sea and Russia resulting from lower drilling efficiency and adverse weather conditions.  WesternGeco registered an expected sequential decline in multi client revenue while marine activity improved slightly with higher vessel utilization. Looking at the areas in more detail, in North America all GeoMarkets saw revenue growth sequentially. US land grew on increased drilling activity coupled with some pricing improvements that benefited well services technology.  Canada experienced significant growth as a result of the strong winter drilling season particularly for the oil basins in the West. This led to higher demand for well services, wireline and drilling and measurement services. The US Gulf of Mexico revenue was higher sequentially on increased shelf and deepwater activity that resulted in strong demand for drilling and measurements, testing services and wireline technologies.  Alaska revenue grew from seasonally high exploration activity. In Latin America/Mexico/Central America GeoMarket revenue decreased sequentially primarily due to weather related slowdowns that effected offshore activity and to delays in the finalization of contracts for SIS and data consulting services activities.  In Venezuela/Trinidad/Tobago revenue fell from the impact of the devaluation of the Venezuela currency and from the absence of deferred revenue recognized in the prior quarter. But these effects were partially offset by increased demand for SIS software. Revenue in the Brazil and the Peru/Columbia/Ecuador GeoMarkets decreased sequentially mostly due to lower completions and SIS sales partially offset by an increase in IPM activity.  Argentina/Bolivia/Chili GeoMarket revenue decreased primarily due to lower SIS software sales. Revenue in the Europe/CIS/Africa area fell sequentially as a result of a combination of lower sales of testing services, equipment, and SIS software with the effect of lower pricing and the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar.  Among the GeoMarkets revenue in the North Sea decreased resulting from a combination of lower drilling activity that impacted drilling and measurements, delays in project start-ups that effected testing services, and lower well services stimulation activities.  Russia revenue was lower mainly due to the severe winter weather while revenue in the Libya GeoMarket fell on early completion of offshore exploration campaigns. In the Middle East/Asia revenue was essentially flat with the previous quarter as growth in the Australia/Papua New Guinea and East Mediterranean GeoMarkets was offset by lower sales of artificial lift products and SIS software following the surge in the fourth quarter and by lower activity in the Arabian, Gulf, Qatar, and Indonesia GeoMarkets.  We gained a number of significant contract wins during the quarter, in Iraq BP awarded us together with our joint venture drilling partner the Iraq Drilling Company, a number of wells on an integrated services basis. In Angola we were awarded a series of six-year contracts for wireline logging, tubing-conveyed perforating, well testing, well completions, coiled-tubing services, and well stimulation vessels.  And in marine seismic, WesternGeco was awarded a number of acquisition service on the Norwegian Continental shelf as well as a contract in Brazil for the region’s first multi azimuth survey. We also announced two significant events during the quarter, the proposed merger with Smith International, and the planned acquisition of Geoservices which closed in about an hour after the time our press release went over the wire this morning.  In the proposed merger with Smith our complimentary products and services will lead to the development of an engineered drilling system that optimizes all the components of the drill string to allow customers to drill more economically in demanding conditions. What we consider to be a step change in drilling performance and well productivity will come from combining measurement and steering capabilities with the engineering and design of complete bottom-hole assemblies and their various components, including the drilling fluid and the drill bits. The addition of Geoservices mud-logging technology to the Schlumberger portfolio will also be an important step in the development of higher-performance drilling systems. The combination of Schlumberger’s real time downhole measurements with Geoservices’ drilling mud analysis will help customers better identify and react to drilling hazards while the combination of mud-logging with Schlumberger formation evaluation measurement will bring a more complete understanding of rock lithology and fluid content.  In addition to Geoservices mud-logging technology and expertise, Geoservices’ footprint, expertise and technology in slickline well intervention and field production surveillance will complement existing Schlumberger activities. I look forward to welcoming both the employees of Smith and Geoservices to Schlumberger. Our outlook for the remainder of 2010 confirms the optimism we expressed at the beginning of the year. At WesternGeco while the second quarter will see increased vessel transits, strong tendering activity in marine is leading to much improved visibility on the remainder of 2010 and utilization will be higher than originally planned.  However new capacity entering the market is likely to limit pricing gains until later in the year. In North America commitment drilling to hold leases as well interest in domestic oil plays should sustain current activity levels in the United States through the second quarter while Canada will experience the normal spring break-up. Beyond that, the picture is less clear as natural gas prices and the fundamentals of the natural gas remain uncertain. Higher oil prices are leading to tangible evidence that operators are contemplating higher levels of activity than originally planned in international markets. We reiterate our comment from the last quarter that we see improvements in some offshore markets notably the UK sector of the North Sea, Latin America, and West Africa as well as on land in Russia.  In order to prepare for this increase in the latter half of 2010 and in 2011 we have increased our CapEx guidance by $400 million, the bulk of which will be aimed at drilling and measurements and high-end wireline technologies.  Finally, I am on record as saying that I felt international margins would bottom at the end of the Q2 2010. I am pleased to report I was mistaken. International margins appear to have bottomed and are now likely to resume a positive trend from now on, absent any exceptional circumstances. Thank you very much and I will now hand the call back over for your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt 
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : You earlier in the year you did express optimism but then you sort of dialed the numbers back a little bit for 2010 indicating that maybe the street had got a little bit too optimistic, do we interpret sort of your uptick in outlook to mean that 2010 numbers may now have some upside room and can you talk a little bit about exactly what you’re seeing that gives you the increased confidence over the past month or two.
Andrew Gould : Well firstly I feel pretty comfortable with the sort of overall consensus where it is now. And secondly we are seeing clear signs of increases in activity in the North Sea. You can count them. And similarly we’re seeing the results of some of the exploration campaigns in Latin America which are leading to very high quality revenue for us, particularly in wireline and testing.  And similarly I’ve always thought that some of the title rigs lots in West Africa would get picked up if the oil price was higher than people were planning and that’s exactly what seems to be happening. So its just, its confirmation that’s come through in the last three months at what I was alluding to in January. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : So you’re seeing some concrete examples it sounds like. 
Andrew Gould : Yes.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : I know that you’re transitioning your role a little bit at Schlumberger and the company has done I guess about $10 [billion] in acquisitions here in the first quarter, one closed one yet to close, do you think the acquisition side slows down a little bit or does the focus change in terms of the things you look at, can you maybe walk us through what you’re going to be working on in the next year or two.
Andrew Gould : So firstly apart from niche technologies or opportunities we can’t say no to, yes we have shut down or if you like severely restrained the acquisition pipeline and Paal Kibsgaard will be running the day to day operations as COO and I will be taking care of the integration of Geoservices and Smith as well as obviously helping Paal when he needs help.  So that’s basically how we’re splitting the roles for the next couple of years. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank  
Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank : Wanted to talk about Russia a little bit obviously some weather issues there, but it seems to me there’s been a bit of a disconnect in the market, a lot of the stuff especially in the mature basins spending down a lot there hasn’t recovered much but yet we’re still seeing a lot of the forecasts out there for production growth, I was wondering if you could reconcile those two things and what you see in terms of activity levels and is there a need to ramp up there significantly going forward. 
Andrew Gould : Well I think that last year they were able to sustain and increase their production largely because they got a lot of help from [Vancor] and one other field I can’t remember the name of, but this year if they want to maintain their production at current levels they’re going to have to go back to work in Western Siberia and tendering activity would indicate to us that they do have the intention to do that.  And as well for us we will have an even stronger year in Sacalin then we did last year but the big shift from last year is that we think that there’ll be a lot more drilling in Western Siberia in order to sustain their production.
Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank : And then shifting to Iraq, as you noted some nice contract awards there and there’s again some conflicting trends there, there’s a need to ramp up quickly in a number of cases but also still some uncertainty there surrounding the status of the government and so just wanted your thoughts on what the trajectory looks like there, do you expect additional awards or are we just going to be executing on what’s already out there. 
Andrew Gould : Do you mean for the oil companies.
Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank : For the oil companies and then what that means from a service standpoint.
Andrew Gould : I think that its highly unlikely that there is any more licensing rounds or contract rounds for the oil companies. I think that the future is more likely now to be with the Iraqi national oil companies. I don’t think that the oil companies will hesitate to spend on the first phase of the activity in Iraq just because at this point in time there is no stable government.  I do think that two or three years down the road if they don’t have a satisfactory judicial physical and political atmosphere, they will hesitate before they go into the very large spending that will be required for the new development. But actually they’re spending for the rehabilitation of the existing fields in terms of a budgets of the size of companies we’re looking at is not huge. So I think that activity will as sort of, as has been advertised will go ahead. 
Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank : So any delta from here would be from the NOC there.
Andrew Gould : Yes. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Wanted to just come back to the macro team again here and maybe flesh it out maybe a little bit more and obviously your reference in Dan’s question some tangible evidence that you’re now seeing that gives you the confidence now, you increased your CapEx which I think pretty much underscores your conviction that the market cycle is starting to turn, and probably turn in Schlumberger’s favor, I was wondering if you might give us some insights as to how you see the cycle evolving and how it will in your view accelerate in the international markets and if you can give us some benchmarks and comparisons to prior cycle periods. Is it going to be a faster acceleration in line maybe a little bit slower, if you could give us any color that would be great.
Andrew Gould :  I think there is a bit of a difference between this cycle and the 2004 and 2008 cycle, in 2004 2008 we had a huge amount of natural gas projects going on overseas that were not going to be going on this time around. So we had the whole Qatar LNG ramp up, we had Yemen, we had other stuff in Africa and while there will be some of that this time around, I don’t think its going to be anything like the volume of what we had between 2004 and 2008. So this cycle is going to be far more in my opinion related to oil outside the United States, even inside the United States. And there I think that if you look at the latest demand figures for the non-OECD world, you look at the flattening of the demand drop in the OECD world and you look at the potential call on OPEC I don’t see any reason for the price of oil to decline very far from where it is today in which case gradually confidence is going to grow to bring in a lot more of these particularly offshore projects that we all know that our customers have lined up. And on land its going to increase all the activity and production enhancements so I think absent a double-dip in the developing world or a huge double-dip in the OECD that the oil cycle is probably going to, I hate to say this again, but its going to be stronger for longer. But the gas cycle is going to be very much effected by the amount of LNG that’s just been put on stream and of course by the advent of shale gas, so unconventional gas in the United States. Now in terms of our CapEx what is very satisfactory is these deepwater rigs are starting up on time. We had more, the start ups we anticipated in Q1 have gone on time and pretty flawlessly which means that we’re getting more deepwater activity earlier than we thought and if that carries through that means we had to accelerate the CapEx. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Now in connection with that and how the cycle may be evolving and Schlumberger’s position there seems to a line of thought in the marketplace that Schlumberger is losing share in certain geographic markets and some product lines and I understand this Angola project that you referenced in your press release today I think there’s some element of significance that may be worth mentioning, so I was wondering if you could just talk about your view of Schlumberger’s market share position both from a geographic market and from the technology standpoint and would you generally agree with the view out there that Schlumberger is at risk from the competition. 
Andrew Gould : So let me deal with Angola first, the whole Angola thing that’s been announced by us and others is a renewal. It is not new work. It is a major, major renewal. And in that renewal we have renewed segments we already had working there and we have added segments that were not working there before. In terms, I don’t, its very difficult to believe your own people and market share data, but we constantly look for where we’ve lost market share and we constantly fail to find it. I can only think of one major piece of market share we’ve lost in the last two years. And then I go to the [Spears] data and the Spears data if you look at if Q409 over Q408 says we’ve increased our market share more than our principal competitors so I’m sorry I don’t see it. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: And just basic question now, one area that you think you lost share where would that be. 
Andrew Gould : It was one big contract and I’m not going to rub my poor people’s nose in it. It was one big contract we lost. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Welcome back into the camp of more bullish people again, its good to have you back. 
Andrew Gould : Well its nice to be back, but prudent has always been my watch word in these things. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Absolutely and I hope you of course stick with that, on the jack up side we’re seeing big tender activity in the North Sea and West Africa Middle East of the broad base, of course that the [inaudible] you’re talking to, but we’re not really seeing much in the deepwater market in terms of a kick off of increased tender and contract, so can you give us a little bit of a view on how you see the exploration side turn more into a development drilling kind of kick off both in West Africa and then selected deepwater markets in Asia. Can you give us a little color on what you’re seeing now compared to—
Andrew Gould : Well I think, so firstly the deepwater programs that have been announced and rigs have been contracted for happening as I mentioned earlier they seem to be happening on time which is unusual. Secondly I think that the operators generally will make sure that deepwater rig rates come down a bit and once they’ve done that they will do some exploration.  They hate paying top dollar for exploration rigs so in fact I think an adjustment down similar to what we’ve seen recently in the big deepwater rigs or even the sort of the second or third generation rigs that can do an exploration well in deepwater is very positive for us. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Are you saying that this is not coming over the past couple of, has there been any kind of rate or change in your customer inquiry levels as of late.
Andrew Gould : Only really in West Africa whereas I said earlier there were some semis that had idle slots and those idle slots are getting filled with an exploration well here or there. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: On exploration again on the seismic market you mentioned that you saw firmer [inaudible] into the back end of the year, could you elaborate a little bit, is this you realizing higher prices, is it leading edge, are you expecting to bid a higher, firmer prices.
Andrew Gould : I think the answer is that we, our utilization for 2010 is pretty much wrapped up and therefore we’re expecting to bid higher. Whether we’ll be successful or not is another question. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: On the pricing on renewals if you could repice your international work, let’s say for example you highlighted this Angola contract, this rolling over and renewing, could you give us a little bit of a feel for how a rollover pricing has changed compared to let’s say three months ago, are we back into positive territory again or –
Andrew Gould : No I don’t think so, I don’t think there’s been any change in large tenders, in large tenders in international pricing in the last three months. I’m not exactly sure when this is bid but with the evaluation process and the award process, it was probably bid early last year. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Would you expect at this point to be bidding higher prices and prices rolling off or are you still in negative territory if you’re looking forward from here. 
Andrew Gould : If we look forward from here I think for specific high end technology we will be looking to push price. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company : Along those lines here I was curious as to whether you could provide us with a road map if you will for international margins, do you, you said that they’ve troughed in Q1 but really what I’m looking for is how you see them evolving second half of 2010 and next year and really talking about the interplay between volume, mix and price, and what I’m trying to reference here is back in 2006 and 2007 we were generating 40% incremental margins and how long do you think before we get back to that and what will it take to get back to that. 
Andrew Gould : Well firstly I think that for the balance of this year there are two elements of price that will dominate and they are firstly volume and mix. Volume is better utilization of equipment and mix is the big shift towards deepwater and offshore that’s taking place at the moment. I think that the other thing that will happen in this year, but this depends very much on us, is the $80.00 oil. Our customers will loosen their purse strings on using the high end technology that in the downturn the engineers were told they were not allowed to buy or they should go easy on because it was expensive in the worst of it. So we, if you like, it’s the difference between a cheap bottle of wine and feeling you can afford a good bottle of wine.  So we think we’ll see a little bit of that, not a lot. I don’t think we will get real pricing traction until we start to have volume issues, in other words that people start to move into equipment shortages and I don’t think there’s any way that that could happen this year. I think next year in certain segments particularly drilling and measurements, if the level of drilling stays where it is you will start to see operators wanting to tie up equipment and therefore that gives you some demand pull pricing power.  But I don’t think its this year, I think its next year. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company : Do you think its unreasonable to expect us getting back to those really flush incremental margins sometime next year. 
Andrew Gould : There has to be demand there, so it really, really does depend on the level of activity and I can’t see that yet. Because we really, really get pricing power when our customers are desperate to have the equipment. So in fact in the 2005 cycle one of the things that provoked that was the huge sucking of equipment into Saudi Arabia, that frightened operators elsewhere so if Iraq went very, very fast, which personally I don’t believe, that also could suck in fairly large amounts of equipment. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company : So you don’t see it yet for 2010 yet you’re not necessarily ruling it out for next year. 
Andrew Gould : I’m not ruling it out but I’m not going to call it. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson – JPMorgan 
David Anderson – JPMorgan : Question on WesternGeco I don’t think a choppy recovery will surprise anyone and taking into account your remarks on pricing, I was wondering if you could compare for me how this business is positioned now to where it was in 2002, 2003. It seems to me that with multi client de-emphasized it should be a much quicker uptick in margins, and with your limited capital requirements going forward that maybe you should be hitting mid cycle returns at a much earlier stage then the past cycle. Am I right on that. 
Andrew Gould : The only reason I’m, so firstly I think on multi client you’re right, in other words that the, our library is extremely healthy and that to the extent that activity remains robust particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa then library sales will probably go faster then they did in the last cycle and a lot of that will be to do with technology.  Because we have made major strides, the industry and us, have made major strides in the quality of multi client over the last four or five years. But in marine there is going to be, there is something like 14 or 15 treaty boats that are either new or can come back into the market fairly shortly so that’s what’s going to, if you like, slow pricing uptick in marine seismic, whereas last time around the boats were not in a build cycle and therefore the excess capacity got sucked up faster.  You’re quite right to point out that the Eastern [Ecco] deal means that we will not be in the market for building or huge CapEx commitments for our marine fleet in the next few years. 
David Anderson – JPMorgan : On just a different subject, on your last call it sounded like you were focusing a little bit more on the emerging shales in North America but more recently EMP has been taking up a lot of headlines a lot of talk about a shift into unconventional oil, just wondering if this changes your thinking at all in this market, should we be looking for Schlumberger to perhaps be more aggressive going after this business and kind of what’s your sense of service intensity of the oil versus the gas plays. 
Andrew Gould : I think my competitors have commented that they’re very similar and I think they’re right. I do think and I’m not, please don’t ask me why because I’m not going to say, we do have certain technologies that in these unconsolidated oil plays are quite advantageous. And obviously we will be introducing those probably later this year.  Its adaptation of other technology that we have but its, and its not hydraulic fracturing. But we think that we probably have some tools that can make a difference. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita – UBS 
Angie Sedita – UBS : To dig another cut at the international margins you pieced in 2007, 2008 about 28 to 30% margins, today at 22%, you think that we will return to those peak margins, or potentially go beyond and is that a 2013 event or could it actually be earlier and finally do you think that the increase in IPM risk, there’s margins and returning to those levels. 
Andrew Gould : So firstly I think that the comment I would make which is if you like an indication of the relative mildness of the cycle overseas is that for our margins to only go from 28 to 22 instead of in the teens, probably in the mid teens, is a pretty remarkable situation. But how fast it can go back really, really does depend on how fast activity accelerates and that’s still a judgment I’m afraid on the general economy.  There is no doubt that oil drilling is going to be very solid but how fast its going to go is going to depend very much on the general economy. So can we get back there one day, yes I’m actually convinced we can, but please don’t ask me to say its 2013 or 2014, I don’t know. 
Angie Sedita – UBS : I guess to follow along that as far as talking specifically about Iraq do you think that, how much time do you think it will pass before you get to margins that you’re happy with there and do you need a scale as far as the number of rigs operating in the region to reach those margins and do you have any concerns so far on how your competition is bidding in the region.  
Andrew Gould : I don’t think the first phase in Iraq, in other words the rehabilitation of the existing fields and the just the drilling of wells in non locations is necessarily going to produce for anybody the sort of margins that they like. And also we’re all going to have set up costs, we’re all going to have, it will be pass through but it nonetheless will effect the margins you see, security costs for example.  And have I seen any irrational bidding behavior, so far no I haven’t actually. Not of the, we don’t really obviously know what other people bid but given the pricing we’ve been using, I don’t think we’ve seen totally irrational behavior so far. 
Angie Sedita – UBS : Do you think its scale or time that pushes you—
Andrew Gould : Scale in Iraq is a difficult thing, I think its going to go project by project. For example you do not want to build out infrastructure in advance of work because every time you build a new piece of infrastructure it adds to your security risk and your security costs. Every time you have a new base, you have to have more security and it costs you more. So I think people will build out, certainly we will build out project by project. 
Angie Sedita – UBS : And then finally going along with the scale side, do you want to give us your thoughts on Mexico, the labs, the incentive contracts and do you think that over time we could go back to the recent highs as far as activity levels that we saw in 2009 or will that take some time or just lack of clarity so far. 
Andrew Gould : Everyone, our lab is started like everybody else’s, we in fact have had a group in Mexico City studying this problem for the last two years so we’re not, we have some ideas and actually I think that it will be quite a long time, at least a couple of years, before Pamex is in a position to judge whether or not the production potential justifies the scale of drilling program that they previously had.  So I think it will be a couple of years before we know that and in the meantime yes they will drill but I don’t think they will drill on anything like the scale they were drilling before. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: First question is we haven’t really talked too much about North America, you’re more bullish on international and that seems very logical, less visibility in North America because of the gas situation but could you talk maybe to the profitability levels in this market, the rig count say flattens, can North America reach a reasonable profitability level for Schlumberger. 
Andrew Gould : Well yes, I think at this level of rigs, when we’ve completed the various initiatives we have on the way to improve our utilization and improve our decision making, I think that we can reach a level of profitability that will satisfy us, yes. But we’re already a little way into that process so far therefore the improvement we got in Q1 was a good job on the part of the people who were involved. 
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: Is part of the GeoMarket reassessment in cost initiative that you’ve talked about last time that is getting you there.
Andrew Gould : Its not really a cost initiative its more a question of management control over the levers which we had to decentralize and which we’re busy centralizing in different basins. 
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: On international you noted Saudi as a sort of driver or catalyst in the last cycle, two parts here, is Saudi market going to be less important in this coming cycle and maybe is there another market like Saudi that’s going to be that kind of I guess driver of profitability or the one that really makes everything move this cycle. 
Andrew Gould : I don’t think that anyone else in the world is going to build on a scale, build out on a scale that Saudi builds out between 2005 and 2009. Saudi will remain a very, very important market not just for oil but also because they have very ambitious plans in gas and very ambitious plans in exploration.  I don’t see another market that is capable of ramping up as fast as Saudi did. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Just a couple of clean up questions, on the international margins you said that the first quarter is the bottom would that statement apply individually to the three regions. 
Andrew Gould : No I think I’m going to say it applies globally, because you can always have a mix effect that will uptick or down tick a particular region in a particular quarter. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: With that in mind, do you think that those down ticks could drive the margins in any one of the regions below what they were in the first quarter.  
Andrew Gould : It doesn’t look that way. We’re not talking about North America right. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: No international. And on North America in regards to these management initiatives where would you say you are in the implementation, it sounds like your review is finished and you’re in the implementation stage, is that correct. 
Andrew Gould : I would say that we’re more than a third but less than half way into the implementation. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: And I don’t know if you can answer this but in a steady state activity environment what kind of margin improvement are you targeting with these initiatives. 
Andrew Gould : I don’t think I’m going to discuss that. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: And in regards to your earlier comments about Mexico not getting back to the level of drilling activity, that was specific to Chicontepec. 
Andrew Gould : Yes. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker – Citi
Robin Shoemaker – Citi: Just to finish that question we can look back and see that over the last years that Schlumberger’s margins in North America have been almost exactly comparable to its peers, and for the fourth quarter and the first quarter clearly was below so it sounds like you believe that with the initiatives you’re taking you will be back very much in line with the other multi service companies in North America. 
Andrew Gould : So I would be very disappointed if our people in North America didn’t have at least that ambition. The only thing I would say is that with one of our competitors we have a comparable mix, with the other one we don’t yet but they will shortly. So the mix effect can effect what the overall margin is for each company. And when we finished, closed the Smith transaction and when Baker closed the BJ transaction we have to relook at the whole margin landscape. 
Robin Shoemaker – Citi: Then just on the deepwater market where you had I guess a favorable comment about the timing of the deepwater rig start ups, so if we think about all of the rigs that are under construction today and the timing that we can see that they’re scheduled for delivery certainly looks like 2012 would be the first really full year and what is the order of magnitude of that increase in deepwater drilling 2010 versus 2011, the bulk of the rigs really seem to be mostly coming in 2011. 
Andrew Gould : It means that, I don’t have the numbers in front of me but certainly 2010 is much bigger than 2009 and then again 2011 is much bigger than 2010. And actually 2012 I haven’t even looked at. Because you know when a rig comes into the market if you take the number of rigs that people announce are coming into the market in any one year you basically have to divide it in two because the average would arrive half way through the year. So this year we get the full effect of the rigs that came into the market in 2009 and half the effect of 2010 and next year we get the cumulative 2009 and 2010 and half of 2011. So you’re probably quite right that 2012 will be the high point of deepwater activity. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Sanchez – Howard Weil 
William Sanchez – Howard Weil : I was curious as it relates again to Latin America and the margin performance being surprisingly good, unlike your peers you didn’t identify specifically the Venezuela devaluation as a non-recurring item, just curious as to what kind of impact that had negatively to the quarter and what kind of add back could we have expected there and the results in Latin America.
Andrew Gould : I’m going to let Simon discuss the Venezuela valuation and if you want more granularity on the rest of it I’ll talk about it afterwards. 
Simon Ayat : Let me take this in two parts, first why we didn’t see any impact on the devaluation, we obviously have an impact on the devaluation, the reason it was not apparent because in Venezuela we do take a very prudent approach within the rules of accounting, we anticipated this kind of devaluation and we have deferred certain gains from exchange that we experienced during 2009 to be ready for this eventuality. And it did take place and we covered it from within the balance sheet. Now as far as the impact on the business obviously the revenue drops because we have a Bolívar portion of our revenue but on the cost side it has a positive impact because the cost reduced given the new rates and as a result was slightly positive impact on the margin overall in Venezuela. So this is basically the story. 
Andrew Gould : And I would say the other element that helped us is that a lot of the adjustment of our cost based in Mexico took place in 2009 as well. 
William Sanchez – Howard Weil : And that’s been a big difference for you, you don’t feel like you’re carrying additional cost that some may be doing as they await what happens in Mexico in terms of spending. 
Andrew Gould : We don’t own rigs very many of them anyway. 
William Sanchez – Howard Weil : My follow-up would be you mentioned limits on the first quarter share repurchases here or Safe Harbor I’m just wondering if there’s any limits that we should think about share repurchases either in the second quarter or until the Smith acquisition is closed. 
Simon Ayat : There are certain rules that we have to follow, we continue to buy now under the Safe Harbor rule and as soon as the proxies are mailed to the shareholders of Smith there is a blackout period that we have to respect until the shareholders vote on the transaction, then we’ll be free to buy without limits except the normal limit for buybacks.  So there is a period of time, we hope it will not be too long between the mailing of the proxy to the shareholders and the voting on the transaction. 
William Sanchez – Howard Weil : And we should probably still expect that you’re buying back enough stock to offset any dilution as a whole for the company is that fair.
Andrew Gould : Dilution from the employee programs, yes. The Smith transaction it won’t really be, we can’t really look at that until as Simon says, the Smith shareholders have voted. 
Simon Ayat : But the rate we are buying at its bigger than the dilution from the stock based compensation program. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast: I note as Bill did the performance in Latin America is very good on the margin side in particular and so with that my question is actually around Europe/Africa margins which might have been a little bit lower although we were, you alerted us to the weather impacts, what’s the progression from here with the recovery of some of those transitory issues on weather in the North Sea, weather in Russia, and you’ve mentioned some specific contract awards in Russia but when do we get back to sort of 2Q, 3Q 2009 margins in that region. 
Andrew Gould : Q3 2009, how much as that Simon, do you have that in front of you Pierre. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast: In the low to mid 20’s.
Andrew Gould : I think we’ll get back to the low 20’s fairly quickly because the trouble with Russian weather is that not only do you have your equipment doing nothing but you also have to pay to heat it. So the cost effect of minus 35 temperature days is huge. So aside the activity just the equipment working normally makes a huge difference to the margin. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast: So there’s a big piece and then the North Sea as well some recovery there—
Andrew Gould : The North Sea efficiency will improve in the second quarter and in fact our stimulation boat was dry docked for 18 days as well in Q1. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: I wanted to follow-up on North America and sort of the reshuffling process that you have going on there, you’ve actually grown in line with peers sequentially but your incremental margins are in line with peers as well but I’m assuming you’re carrying some extra costs associated with this and I know you don’t like to break that out, but are we talking about incremental or additional costs in the $20 to $30 million range that at some point through the year will fade.
Andrew Gould : No I don’t think you should think of it as incremental cost, I think there is still cost we have in North America that we need to eliminate. So its idle facilities, things like that and you know that all takes place over the balance of the year so there is incremental costs associated with the reorganization or the restructuring or whatever you want to call it, but it really is fairly marginal. It’s a group of people.  So I wouldn’t take it as something that’s just going to disappear but that group of people is working at getting the whole cost base down. 
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: So we should measure the success of this risk shuffling as higher incremental margins to allow you to catch up to peers over the course of the next four quarters. 
Andrew Gould : Yes. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler - Credit Suisse 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: A couple of unrelated questions, just a follow-up on the North American market in the assessment you’ve made to date are there changes to your capital commitment that you expect in North America. 
Andrew Gould : One of the effects of what we’re doing should be much higher equipment utilization. And therefore the revenue dollar per hydraulic horsepower or whatever you want to use as a measure should increase and therefore ultimately the amount of CapEx that we’ll need to cover what we do compared to Schlumberger did in the past will probably go down. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: So the additional $400 million it does not sound like is being directed—
Andrew Gould : No I was very clear, the additional $400 million is drilling and measurement and high end wireline, its not pressure pumping. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: And then can you tell us how much of your percentage of revenues is coming from deepwater today and maybe how you expect that to evolve over the next couple of years then given all we’ve talked about with deepwater.
Andrew Gould :  We haven’t disclosed that. I don’t think we want to at this point in time but it’s a substantial portion and it obviously has a very high growth factor. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: That’s why I figured I’d probe, how about if I ask it a little more generally just in terms of offshore, as a percentage, offshore revenues as a percentage of total. 
Andrew Gould : Its not 50% but it’s a, I would say its somewhere between 30 and 40. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wagar Syed – Macquarie Capital 
Wagar Syed – Macquarie Capital :  I just wanted to get a sense from you about the outlook for Venezuela and what does the payment schedule look like now. 
Andrew Gould : I would describe the payment schedule as thoroughly under control and a very good understanding between ourselves and [inaudible] service for what is necessary. And the activity actually I think will pick up slightly this year particularly for us given the amount of success they’ve had with gas. So I think Venezuela will finally have a slightly better year this year then they did last year. 
Wagar Syed – Macquarie Capital : Do you see any recurring expenses from this healthcare bill. 
Simon Ayat : No this is, basically there was a write off of some deferred tax assets so we’re not going to see this as ongoing no, it was one-time.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak 
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak : I just wanted to get a clarification on those deepwater comments you made earlier I guess in response to Robin’s question, you said peek in 2012 but I’m assuming you meant based off of the equipment we know is already been ordered and is being built now rather than an actual peek in the market. 
Andrew Gould : A peek on what we know is going to come to the market, yes. Not anything that gets launched now. And it assumes that, there’s a very high utilization rate for deepwater rigs as well. 
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak : And one other unrelated, in Russia you’re talking about a little bit more of a swing to Western from Eastern Siberia, would that imply that margins will while they recover nicely will, may not be as high on the individual work since its less, more fields and so a little more competitive and higher—
Andrew Gould : No I think that the, while you’re quite correct to point out that Western Siberia margins are not as high as Eastern Siberia or Sacalin, the sheer volume will compensate for that. 
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak : And you don’t think there’s, some of these expansions of your competitors trying to be like you will limit upside pricing power or limit pricing power. 
Andrew Gould :  No. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
Malcolm Theobald: Prior to closing the call I would like to mention that the Schlumberger second quarter 2010 earnings conference call will be held on Friday, July 23, at 9 am US Eastern time. Now I would like to thank you for participating in today’s call.

Operator: Welcome to the Schlumberger Limited earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald; please go ahead, sir.
Malcolm Theobald: Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full year 2009 results conference call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer.  Prior to Andrew's overview of the results and his comments on the outlook Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements we will welcome your questions. Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat : Thanks Malcolm, ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter income was $0.67 per share, this is up $0.02 sequentially and down $0.36 compared to the same quarter of last year, excluding the $0.08 of charges we took in Q4 of last year.  Turning the business segments, Oilfield services fourth quarter revenue increased 4% sequentially, while WesternGeco revenue increased 19%. Roughly one third of the sequential increase in OFS is attributable to the additional year-end surge in product sales.  Oilfield services pre-tax operating income of $1 billion decreased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Oilfield services margins declined by 157 basis points sequentially to 19.5%, as improvements in the Middle East and Asia was more than offset by declines in North America, Latin America, and Europe/CIS/Africa.  Overall international margins in OFS were 23.4%. By area Oilfield services sequential pre-tax operating margins highlights were as follows. North America declined by 129 basis points to 2.1% as increased activity in the US land and Gulf of Mexico geo markets were insufficient to increase the impact of less favorable revenue mix in Canada and lower activity in the Alaska geo market.  Latin America decreased by 254 basis points to 15.8% primarily as a result of the reduced activity and the less favorable revenue mix in the Mexico/Central America geo market. Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 21.6%, 208 basis points lower principally due to lower activity in Russia as a result of year end customer budget constraints.  Finally Middle East/Asia margin improved by 66 basis points to 32.4% primarily due to the positive impact of the more favorable mix of deepwater and exploration related activity and year-end software sales.  At WesternGeco pre-tax income of $115 million reflected an increase in pre-tax margins of 776 basis points to 20.9%. This increase was largely attributable to year-end multi client sales partially offset by the impact of the lower pricing and project delays in marine.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 17.6%. This was lower than last quarter primarily due to more favorable geographic earnings mix. As we have previously mentioned and as you saw this quarter the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic earnings mix and as such we may continue to experience volatility on a quarterly basis.  Net debt was $126 million at the end of the quarter as compared to $660 million at the end of Q3 and $1.1 billion at the end of last year. This improvement was driven by strong cash flows from operations. We ended the quarter with $5.4 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition $2.8 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remained unused and were available at the end of December.  This compares to short-term debt of only $1.1 billion which as a reminder includes $321 million of convertible debentures which we expect to be converted to equity by the end of second quarter of 2010. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $500 million of stock repurchases, $676 million of CapEx and $231 million of pension funding.  We restarted our stock buyback program during the quarter and bought back 7.8 million shares at an average price of $63.91. Our Q4 buyback activity served to offset the vast majority of the dilution caused by our stock based compensation programs during all of 2009. Oilfield services CapEx is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2010 as compared to $1.9 billion in 2009. WesternGeco CapEx is expected to approach $300 million as compared to $460 million in 2008.  In summary our balance sheet remains very strong and it continues to provide us with a tremendous amount of financial flexibility. And now I will turn the conference over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould : Thank you Simon, good morning everybody. Fourth quarter revenue increased sequentially in North America, Latin America, and Middle East/Asia areas as offshore revenue quality improved with increasing deepwater rig count while software and product sales saw the usual fourth quarter strength.  Europe/CIS/Africa area revenue was flat with the previous quarter though stronger offshore activity and year-end software and product sales in the area were not sufficient to offset the seasonal decline in Russia. Amongst the technology, sequential growth was driven by increased deepwater and exploration related activity leading to demand for wire line, testing services and drilling and measurements technologies, while growth was also recorded on land in North America primarily from increased well services activity.  WesternGeco achieved highly satisfactory fourth quarter multi client revenues due largely to wide-azimuth survey sales in the Gulf of Mexico. I will now turn to the areas in more detail.  In North America where revenue increased sequentially by 6%, the US land geo market grew on increased drilling activity. This however was offset by lower pricing for well services technologies. The US Gulf of Mexico geo market revenue was up marginally due to improved shelf activity and the beginning of a build up in the deepwater, but these positive effects were hampered by downtime associated with Hurricane Ida as well as some pricing pressure.  Canada revenue was flat with the previous quarter but of lower quality while Alaska revenue fell sequentially due to a slowdown in activity resulting from operator budget constraints. In Latin America revenue grew 5% sequentially and in the Peru/Columbia/Ecuador geo market revenue increased primarily on greater demand for drilling and measurements, wire line and testing services, with this demand resulting from increased drilling activity.  Higher SIS software sales and artificial lift products also contributed to the growth. In Brazil revenue was higher from increased offshore exploration activity as well as from the software sales and completions product sales. The Venezuela/Trinidad/Tobago geo market recorded growth primarily from integrated project management activity while activity in Argentina/Bolivia/Chili was higher due to increased activity and SIS software sales.  These increases however were partially offset by a decrease in Mexico/Central America where revenue that resulted declined as a result of a reduced activity. Revenue in the Europe/CIS/Africa area was flat with the previous. In Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea revenue grew as a result of strong testing services product sales and an increase in exploration activity that led to greater demand for wire line services.  In Western Southern Africa revenue increased on high demand for drilling and measurement services. The North Sea geo market also recorded growth primarily as a result of increased well services stimulation activity while the Libya geo market revenue increased due to higher deepwater testing services and wire line exploration activity. These increases were however partially offset by the lower revenue in Russia as a result of client budgeting constraints and seasonal weather effects which mainly effected IPM activity. Revenue was also lower in North Africa on reduced testing product sales and in the Caspian geo market on the completion of drilling campaigns. In the Middle East and Asia sequential revenue growth of 7% was driven by an increase in deepwater and exploration related activities that led to strong demand for wire line services.  Seasonal artificial lift and SIS software product sales also contributed to growth. As I mentioned earlier sequential revenue growth at WesternGeco was led by multi client through strong year-end sales of wide-azimuth surveys in the US Gulf of Mexico. Land revenue also grew due to increased activity in the Middle East and North Africa but overall these increases were somewhat offset by a significant decrease in marine as a result of weaker pricing, project start up delays, and [vessel] transits.  Our outlook for 2010 remains largely dependent on the prospects for the general economy. At the end of the third quarter we indicated that we were encouraged that signs were emerging that the demand for oil and gas would begin to increase. Consensus forecast now predict that oil demand in 2010 will increase particularly in the developing world for the first time since 2007. As a result we feel that oil prices are likely to be sustained at current levels and that as our customers’ confidence grows exploration and production budgets will increase. We feel that considerable leverage to increase investment exists in offshore markets, in Russia, as well as in certain emerging investment opportunities such as Iraq.  These events will be dependent on continued increases in economic growth in the second half of the year beyond the current government stimulus packages. For natural gas activity we remain a great deal more cautious. Despite signs of some recovery in industrial demand and recent cold weather, we consider that worldwide markets remain generally over supplied.  Increased flows of LNG together with additional capacity being added in 2010 as well as a general uncertainty over the decline rates of unconventional gas production have the potential to limit the current increase in North American gas drilling rig count.  We anticipate that 2010 will be a better year for multi client seismic, an improved activity for land seismic particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. While marine activity will be reasonably robust pricing improvements will be limited due to continued new capacity additions.  Longer-term, we remain increasingly confident that considerably increased spending will be necessary to maintain sufficient reserves in production of hydrocarbons to meet the world’s need. Our technology portfolio and worldwide infrastructure mean we are strongly positioned to capture growth opportunities as our customers begin to increase their investment. And I will now hand the call back over to Malcolm.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you Andrew, we will now open the call for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  I will kick off with Iraq, you’ve been very cautious about your commentary on Iraq all along. This is the first time we hear you highlighting Iraq as a significant area of opportunity, can you discuss through what it is that’s changed with respect, I presume to timing and magnitude and relative to your previous thoughts.
Andrew Gould : Well the change relative to my previous thinking is the results of the second round. And the time constraints have been put on the operators to reach the initial plateau production. If that timetable is adhered to, then it implies a huge amount of service activity over the next two or three years.  Now you know I have to have my normal caveats, they are that the election takes place with a satisfactory political result and that some form of oil law is put into place because I still don’t think our customers will make major, major commitments until that happens.  But currently given what they’ve signed, it would seem that there is going to be a considerable increase in activity in Iraq. I don’t think it will have a material effect on results in 2010 but we may well start to see the ramp up in the second half of the year. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Can you talk a little bit about how you see Schlumberger being proficient. What are the big obstacles, competitive advantages that you would have in Iraq. 
Andrew Gould : Well I’m not going to do that over a phone line where all my competitors are listening, but we have a very robust plan in place. We have inherited relationships from the past in Iraq. We have everything necessary to operate legally from the past. And the signs are very encouraging that the offering we have is going to be competitive. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: You mentioned exploration, you mentioned development and it seems in your customer inquiry levels with the spec to kind of the next 12 to 18 months compared to the previous 12 to 18 months, are we going to have an exploration recovery or is it going to be drilling in terms of your product offering of not only seismic but everything else from open hole, wire line--
Andrew Gould : Well I think it will be both but the ratio of new deepwater rigs and the places where they’re going means there will be a lot of, quite a lot of exploration and appraisal. So beyond this year if commodity prices hold where they are I think we will see a recovery in exploration. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt 
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : Your capital spending for 2010 is fairly significant uptick, how much impact do you think that’s going to have on 2010 or is this really more of a 2011—
Andrew Gould : We’re counting outside the normal replacement CapEx and some IPM projects and stuff like that, we’re counting that in 2008 we had eight deepwater new builds come into our market, 23 in 2009, and 35 in 2010. Now you know that they don’t all come on the first of January so you probably have to chop those numbers in half in any one year.  But what it does mean is there is still significant deepwater CapEx that’s going to come through in 2010 and as you rightly point out a lot of that will be only revenue generating in 2011. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : If I think about, I’m just, your commentary is I guess a little bit cautious, your actions are more aggressive, I’m thinking about as we look out to 2011 and I realize that’s still a year away but I look back at 2008 and see a $27 million revenue number, we’re clearly lower than that in 2009, we’ll be lower than that in 2010, but is that in the gun sights for 2011 given everything you see and the amount of money you’re spending and the way you think the marketplace out. 
Andrew Gould : Well actually that depends entirely on North America. I have no doubt we will have a significant upswing overseas but don’t forget the significant drop in our revenue is in North America compared to the $27 billion you’re talking about. North America and seismic, put it that way. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: I have a question on the gas side actually, you definitely appear more confident in the oil fundamentals than gas and you mentioned natural gas in the note and in your comments, that’s really a challenge, but that wasn’t really clearly in North America comment was what I read into it, how important to global upstream activity do you think an uptick in gas related activity is. 
Andrew Gould : We’re not counting on any big uptick in gas related activity in the next couple of years outside North America. The big [Katary] projects will come on, the Yemen project has come on. There are other projects that are coming on. So yes you will see a few big gas developments in Asia probably but we’re not counting on a big increase in gas because as I said earlier, worldwide the gas market is substantially over supplied at this point in time.  Can I just qualify that, there are domestic gas plays that people are doing to substitute energy sources particularly in the Middle East. So in Saudi, Kuwait, Orman, Abu Dhabi, places like that there gas activity, but it is local its not for export, its for substitute power sources within the country. 
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: I guess does this modestly or highly contain potential upside or maybe the pace of what we looks like the beginning of another up cycle here. You had mentioned that North America was going to limit your ability to get to those numbers that Dan had laid out, is this a bigger deal or just sort of a smaller deal, the international gas activity. 
Andrew Gould : No I don’t think, I think it’s a smaller deal than the two factors I mentioned to Dan. 
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: How does international gas activity rank in terms of oil service intensity versus oil or even domestic natural gas activity. 
Andrew Gould : The sources of gas are becoming so diverse that’s a very difficult question to qualify. For example most of the Middle East gas is highly toxic. It has very high H2S fractions, a lot of it has high C02 content and therefore these are fairly high cost operations, they’re fairly service intensive and they imply specialized equipment and a lot of measurement to establish what the gas stream consists of. And then you go to other places like the Northwest shelf in Australia where its really nice clean gas and they’re less intensive. But overall I would say in the development phase there is not a great deal of difference.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: I was wondering if you would be able to give us some color on some of the pricing trends that are evolving both in North America and international and what can of an impact that would have on either margin improvement or margin degradation as we move out into 2010. 
Andrew Gould : As I said in my script, US land revenues were up but we did not feel any pricing traction in US land until December. So it didn’t effect the quarter really. The pricing traction we have in US land particularly in pressure pumping is in the more complex operations where frankly if we don’t get price increases we lose money because we’re tearing our equipment to pieces.  And they are individual contracts and in no way could we today impose a blanket price on our pressure pumping price list. So that trend has continued through the beginning of the year that we have been able to get good price increases on specific operations.  Overseas I would say that we are still feeling some effect from the pricing concessions we made in 2009 but that currently I would say prices in offshore markets are in the process of flattening and I always said, I’ve always said since the beginning of this that the overseas cycle was 18 months and it would probably bottom at the end of the second quarter of 2010 and I would still stick to that story.  I think that if oil prices are maintained, if offshore activity recovers somewhat, there will be a little bit more pricing traction in the second half of this year. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: So more a trend 2010 transition year and 2011 inflection.
Andrew Gould : Exactly.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: My follow-up for you is obviously a lot of noise coming in through Mexico toward the tail end of the year and it appears that they are now in process of signing new incentive based type of contracts, could you give us some perspective on what those new contracts may mean for opportunities for service companies in Mexico and given the production decline, what kind of mix of business do you see happening next year. 
Andrew Gould : So the only incentive contracts I’ve heard talked about are for production in [inaudible]. I haven’t heard of any others. The Pemex activity we think will swing back more towards the south and we think that a lot more of it will actually be directly controlled by Pemex rather than IPM.  Obviously with a huge amount of equipment that flowed into Mexico when they were ramping up Chicontepec and the subsequent decrease in activity in Chicontepec which is going to happen throughout the year, it hasn’t really happened yet, there is going to be a lot of surplus equipment in Mexico, which will either hopefully I don’t know, flow back to North America or decrease pricing in Mexico and probably a bit of both. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company : I’m struck by the fact that on the one hand that we are I think for good reasons relatively subdued on global gas development prospects over the next few years if I understood you correctly, and yet you juxtaposed that outlook with the Exxon purchase of XTO, increasing IOC participation in Ferber with regard to shales, how do you reconcile those two. 
Andrew Gould : I think that the IOCs have generally realized that there are lots of criteria to judge where you invest. One is stable political environment, large domestic market, and new resource and I think the IOCs have realized that there is a substantial new resource in North America and the technology for that resource has been developed in North America and therefore they are now investing in it.  It seems very logical to me. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company : Secondly any update with regard to your perspective on the activity outlook for Russia. 
Andrew Gould : I think that we would say that Russia was able to sustain its domestic production in 2009 through the addition of new fields in Eastern Siberia, notably [Rancor]. But at the same time production in Western Siberia decreased fairly dramatically and that there are going to have to spend a lot more in Russia, in Western Siberia if they want to sustain their production level in 2010. That’s why we’re feeling fairly optimistic on Russia coupled with the fact that it will be another good year for us in [Sakhalin] and there are still quite a few new projects in Eastern Siberia. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company : And then just very quickly do you know what the sequential increase in North American land revenues was.
Simon Ayat : Well most of the increase we had in North America that really came from land and most of the increase, slight increase from the, 12%.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company : It was 12%. 
Andrew Gould : Yes, Q4 over Q3. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: I have a quick question on WesternGeco one of your competitors talked about not having available capacity through the first half of 2010, what are you seeing in terms of your forward visibility on the contract side and could the market get back into balance in the back half of 2010 as well. 
Andrew Gould : I think if we, so you have to remember that we have converted some recording boats to source boats, right, so our actual fleet size for recording is down. Total fleet size is the same but recording boats are down. We have some very large multi client programs in the Gulf of Mexico which are very well funded. And the rest of our capacity through the half year I think is largely booked up.  But it is not yet, the bidding situation is not robust for us to convert those source vessels back to recording vessels. I think its highly unlikely given the manner of capacity that still has to hit the market that the supply and demand will come back into balance in 2010.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: Even towards the back end of the year—
Andrew Gould : If you’re in November, December of 2010 bidding contracts which will be for 2011 then the situation may be a lot better but I don’t think we’ll reach balance in 2010. 
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: Would you suggest though that margins overall for Geco are up as multi client starts to come back. 
Andrew Gould : You know multi client is a crapshoot, we never know until the last minute. The [lead] sales this year are good but they’re not great. So we think there’ll be some improvement as I said in my commentary but how good its actually going to be I don’t know.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: I’d like to come back to the natural gas topic again and specifically your comment about the uncertainty surrounding decline rates, that seems to be fairly significant, could you elaborate on that a little bit. This is the topic most people I think have said these unconventional resources are steeply declining production profiles, you seem to be raising a question about that. 
Andrew Gould : No, I don’t disagree that there are steeply declining production profiles, but I don’t think we know yet because of the backlog of gas behind pipe that had not be stimulated and completed because of the actual huge increase in the profile of unconventional gas that we really, really know how much its going to decline in 2010. And you know I saw a very good paper from a rival firm recently, which showed actually that LNG has the potential to balance that decline. Gas consumption is Europe is way off. So a lot of that LNG becomes spot, it has the capacity to offset the decline. Now whether that will happen is another story but that’s why I’m cautious. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: And the related follow-up is that you mention that you’re beginning in some specific markets to see some pricing traction in the frac business, would these sort of broader trends that you’re referring to put that at risk. 
Andrew Gould : I think if the rig count plateaus, yet they will. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Risk of reversing. 
Andrew Gould : Stabilizing or reversing, it depends, I think we have, it’s the usual story, we have to wait until the end of the winter, see where storage is and see what the production profile looks like and then we’ll have a much better idea whether people need to drill more or less. I think the only joker in the pack this year is that in 2009 a lot of people predicted that more LNG would come to the US and it didn’t.  But with the amount of new capacity that the [Katar] was on last year and [Katar] is putting on this year, plus Yemen, plus a couple of others, it has to go somewhere. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Would you mind commenting on the Venezuela devaluation and its impact on Schlumberger.
Simon Ayat : So we are yet to understand the actual rate that will be applicable during Q1, however we in Schlumberger look at our currency exposures very closely and this is not going to have an impact on the reevaluation of the balance sheet. Going forward if the official rate will, the devaluation will take place, it will reduce our revenue because of the local currency portion will obviously be less in the corresponding dollars, however it has no impact on the profitability.  It is slightly better as a matter of fact. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: I have sort of three part follow-up on Iraq, number one of the let’s say seven to 11 projects it seemed like they could go forward, do you see most of these going IPM. Secondly, how do you see the likely profitability of the work in Iraq versus other countries in the region, and thirdly, do you think that there’ll be issues surrounding the capacity of the oil service industry to service all these projects if they all seem to want to come in the second half of the year.
Andrew Gould : So if I can answer the third part first, if they all want to come in the second part of the year, yes. And if I can answer the first one then, yes, I do think they’re largely going to be IPM type projects largely because there is very low infrastructure on the ground particularly rigs. And therefore the capacity to do IPM and to put rigs on the ground is going to be extremely, the determining factor in the first year or so. 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: The last part is give what you said about that the industry could have trouble servicing it, it would seem that this should be given the risks and everything else highly profitable work. 
Andrew Gould : Well I don’t think people are going to particularly given the risks, I don't think people are going to give it away. 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Back to the US, what is the magnitude of the increase in the rig related recovery before you’d begin to see pricing improvement for conventional bread and butter work for pressure pumping, directional and wire lines. 
Andrew Gould : I think wire line is almost there. Directional has never been effected as much as wire line or pressure pumping because as you know the horizontal count has grown so much that I think there’s issues, no pricing issues with directional equipment. And pressure pumping I don’t really know but I think its considerably higher than where we are today.  I think one of two things are going to happen, either all these, either the rig count will increase, or and I suspect this is more likely, all these massive fracs are going to tear up so much equipment that the market will come in to balance through equipment disappearing more rapidly than it usually does. 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Looking at the international land business do you see an increased amount of that business going IPM in the future and if so will there be a significant increase and what are the implications for margins and profitability if indeed that is the case. 
Andrew Gould : Well let me put it this way, despite the drop in Mexico, Schlumberger’s IPM revenues will increase in 2010 largely due to Russia and the Middle East. And the profitability will vary in function of the type of project that you are doing. And it will never be anything like offshore but it will be perfectly satisfactory. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Sanchez – Howard Weil 
William Sanchez – Howard Weil : Question just back on international margins here specifically Middle East/Asia, we saw an improvement here versus third quarter, just curious how much confidence do you have right now given some of your prior comments that margins have troughed in your Middle East/Asian region and then as a follow-up, if we look at your CIS/West Africa down 200 bps but you talked about Russia being the culprit there, and we know weather was a problem, should we assume you recover those 200 basis points in the first quarter in that region. 
Andrew Gould : I don’t think we’ll recover it in the first quarter because we don’t get the [Sakhalin] activity back until the second and third quarter and the ramp up will only happen towards the end of the first quarter so I very much doubt we will get back the 200 and actually, there will be other, for example Libya is not going to be so strong because the exploration success in Libya has been very low.  So we’ll see a lot of exploration programs winding down. I think you have to go back to what I said on an earlier comment, that I’ve always said that the cycle in the Eastern Hemisphere would sort of trough towards the middle of this year and our margins will be lumpy depending on our revenue mix.  The improvement in MEA, this quarter was large, just as we said due to exploration, wire line testing, and very strong software sales. So I think you have to assume they’re going to be lumpy for a couple more quarters.  
William Sanchez – Howard Weil : One follow-up specifically the declines on Mexico, and I know it was addressed earlier kind of your broad thoughts there, but how much of that was due specifically due to Chicontepec slowdowns, or how much of that was really due to activity declines in areas like the Burgos that we know one of your competitors mentioned during the fourth quarter, or was it a bit of both. 
Andrew Gould : I think there’s, I think Pemex is relooking at everything. Gas prices go up to a point where its probably cheaper for Mexico to buy rather than drill in Burgos. And I think that we will, activity will be decent but its not going to, there’s so much equipment in Mexico its not going to do us a lot of good. 
William Sanchez – Howard Weil : Is some of the talk about dollars shifting away from Chicontepec to say Cantarell I gotta believe would be a favorable trade for you given your high market share there and what’s probably higher margin direct service work. 
Andrew Gould : As I said on an earlier call we feel that quite a lot of what, both onshore and offshore will shift back towards direct Pemex contracting, yes. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler - Credit Suisse
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: Couple of unrelated questions please, first can you just give us a little more color on what happened in the fourth quarter in Canada, I think it was a surprise to see flat revenues, a little bit more on that mix commentary please.
Andrew Gould : We had a very, very strong Q3 because we had an extremely profitable campaign for one of the operators. So we just, that was a one-time campaign and it didn’t repeat in Q4. So we probably should say that the margins in Q4 were stronger than were sustainable without that extremely profitable piece of work. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: The margins in Q4 were higher—
Andrew Gould : The reason the margins in Canada declined in Q4 was nothing to do with the level of activity, it was to do with the type of activity because in Q3 we had an extremely profitable campaign for one operator which increased the margins, which did not repeat itself in Q4.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: So this is, let me make sure I’m clear on it, you moved a fair amount of equipment out of Canada at some point as part of cost reduction efforts, has equipment moved back in, are you equipped to take advantage of winter drilling seasons in a more general sense. 
Andrew Gould : We don’t have an issue of equipment in Canada. We did move some out, yes, a couple of years ago, but we don’t have an issue at the moment. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: And the unrelated follow-up is just can you, you talked about the strength in the software sales and there were some references for artificial lift strength and year end product sales as well, I guess I’m curious what you read into that relative to customers and managing discretionary spending in 2009, if anything, was it a positive, did you take it as a positive sign that they were still going to proceed as normal. 
Andrew Gould :  I wouldn’t read anything into artificial lift or completions except perhaps some restocking after having pared down their inventories in late 2008, early 2009. Software sales, I think the purse strings were freed up a bit so maybe particularly in software they did an excellent job and we probably had a really, really strong fourth quarter in software relative to other fourth quarters I mean. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: But you’re taking some of the credit just for the business development.
Andrew Gould : Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: I wanted to ask you, going back to the deepwater theme, as more deepwater rigs come into the market and based on your experience I think you mentioned 23 that started up in 2009, are your revenues and the quality of revenues from those new deepwater rigs matching your expectations or above or below, could you characterize that broadly. 
Andrew Gould :  Well so far they’re certainly matching our expectations. In some areas they’re better, in some areas they’re not quite as strong but overall yes, they’re matching our expectations. 
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: And then you mentioned in the Middle East to Asia region you [cited] deepwater contribution, where specifically and what makes that stand out. 
Andrew Gould : I would say that India, Indonesia, and Australia and a little bit of Southeast Asia as well, Malaysia, that sort of thing. Its quite scattered in fact. 
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: So what you were saying earlier, I just want to clarify, the 35 deepwater rigs that are delivered this year, they really don’t contribute until 2011 but the—
Andrew Gould : Well they do but not on the basis of 35 because if we get 20 of them in Q4, if you calculate that in rig months, it doesn’t correspond to anything like 35 for a full year. So you really only get the effect in the full year which will be 2011.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: Right and so the 23 from last year really impact—
Andrew Gould : Yes, 2010.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast: WesternGeco, I don’t want to put too fine a point on this, but you mentioned that pricing improvements would be limited to incremental capacity and I just wanted to clarify that, obviously your point is you don’t see further weakness in future bidding projects. 
Andrew Gould : Not at this point in time, no. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast: And then within the quarter some moving parts, and I’m just trying to dissect I think earlier maybe Brad was asking about margins so, with the multi client but yet some impact due to delays, absent the multi client margin impact, what was the underlying trend on the margins at WesternGeco if you can tell us that. 
Andrew Gould : DP was fine, land would have been up slightly and marine would have been down. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast: And the marine impact really due to the delays of the project start-ups. 
Andrew Gould : No, well essentially in the quarter we had three vessels in transit so no revenue. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast: So just timing mostly. 
Andrew Gould : Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Adkins – Raymond James
Marshall Adkins – Raymond James: Let’s come back to the pressure pumping just for a second, we’ve been hearing that very recently of course pricing has been improving as you mentioned, is that due to equipment wearing out, what you addressed or is it people shortages, just having trouble getting people back in the system, and how does that evolve over the next quarter or two.  
Andrew Gould : Well I think its both, I think actually in some of the more complex plays its availability. Its certainly the tearing up of equipment and people a little bit, yes. We are also beginning to see increases in product cost again. But I think that the underlying reason for the price increases at this point in time is the fear of how available equipment is going to be over the next three or four months.  Beyond that, be it pricing traction or the state of the pressure pumping industry, beyond that really depends at what point the rig count plateaus. 
Marshall Adkins – Raymond James: Switch to another one, the end of year sales we talked about, software was exceptionally good, are you worried that there’s going to be a fall off here in Q1 more than we’ve seen historically.
Andrew Gould : Yes I am a little bit.
Marshall Adkins – Raymond James: Is that going to be made up by Canada or other areas. 
Andrew Gould : Very difficult to tell but we certainly, we know software is going to fall off pretty strongly in Q1. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wagar Syed – Macquarie Capital 
Wagar Syed – Macquarie Capital : Just on the theme of pressure pumping again, what you’ve seen in the US is that not only in the, rig count has been going up but also the number of frac stages have been going up, can you see a scenario where even if you have a kind of flattish rig count but frac just continue to go up, thereby driving demand for pressure pumping equipment. 
Andrew Gould : No, there’s absolutely no doubt that every time they increase the size of the or the number of stages that increases the size of the frac fleet that’s necessary. Its another factor that’s going to absorb equipment but I come back to what I said on the last question, it really depends to where the horizontal rig count goes.  The flipside of what you’re saying is these wells have very high PIs which means that they can turn around production quite quickly. 
Wagar Syed – Macquarie Capital : And then on the related question, another market there was recently a shale gas initiative signed in China, when do you see that translating into maybe activity increasing in China and do you see a role of Western service companies in that development. 
Andrew Gould : In China there are a number of shale gas projects that are being discussed and yes we see a role for Western service companies, in design, in the fracs, and execution of the fracs in China, yes.
Wagar Syed – Macquarie Capital : What will be the timing of that. 
Andrew Gould : I really don’t know. I can’t tell you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber – Sanford Bernstein 
Scott Gruber – Sanford Bernstein :  What percentage of the growth in your oilfield CapEx is actually associated with the deepwater.
Andrew Gould : We don’t disclose that but you can assume it’s a very substantial portion. 
Scott Gruber – Sanford Bernstein : More than half you’d say. 
Andrew Gould : No, less than half, more than a quarter and less than half. It’s a substantial number.  
Scott Gruber – Sanford Bernstein : Your peers have been spending well ahead of DD&A with significant growth investments outside of North America, is this starting to show up in any pockets where capacity growth is outpacing demand or pricing pressures starting to emerge in any product lines. 
Andrew Gould : Not really. In fact I’m sort of quite concerned that if the offshore activity comes back strongly in the second half of the year that in high end equipment certain shortages will start to show up. So I think a lot of it is infrastructure. Everyone seems to have built a building in the Middle East and a building in South America and in Brazil, so I think a lot of it is infrastructure. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak 
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak : I wanted to get into the margins in MEA were substantially greater than I thought for, it looks like some of that I guess would be the benefit of software sales, but is it fair to say at this point that based on your last commentary the pricing and margin trends are relatively stable in that part of the world for even if there’s a little bit of dip, that’s about it.
Andrew Gould : It will depend greatly on how much exploration there really is in every quarter and how much testing there is in the quarter. So it will vary in function of the software sales but it will also vary in function of the revenue mix. So they will still be a little lumpy. 
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak : Lumpy but—
Andrew Gould : I don’t think I’m probably going to regret this a great deal, but I don’t think we’ll see a major decline in the Middle East from this point forward. 
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak : And then one other, you were citing your offshore deepwater rigs coming on at a pretty good increase in CapEx, can you say that you already have placements at your traditional share for upper end equipment for the deepwater rigs that are coming on, particularly—
Andrew Gould : I am extremely satisfied with our market share on the new build deepwater rigs. 
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  Just to be clear, can you discuss the impact of international pricing versus the impact of international volume and as to when you see your margins dropping as opposed to the pricing dropping. Its two things that drive margins right, it’s the—
Andrew Gould : What was the question, was it activity or pricing.  
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: It was I think you highlighted you expect pricing to trough in the second quarter internationally but pricing margins isn’t necessarily always the same thing. 
Andrew Gould : No, I think that we would say the same thing for margins. I’ve always said that. Middle of 2010 and when I gave the number of deepwater rigs, you know that the effect is going to be in the second half of the year not the first half of the year. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: And of course we now get the impact of the ones that were delivered last year, so its just quid pro quo. 
Andrew Gould : Yes, we get a better, its much better than in 2009, yes. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: And when it comes to Brazil, [pre salt] and the potential to take some of that technology across to West Africa, could you comment a little bit about how you see technology trends in West Africa particularly on some of the more complex wells that have been drilled in Brazil. 
Andrew Gould : I think that the plate theory that says that there should be a pre salt in West Africa as there is in Brazil is gaining popularity. I think we need a few wells and we probably need a few big exploration wells to find out whether or not people are going to consider that as a play. I’m not a geologist at that level and when you look at the suspect, the people who are going to drill those wells, you have to think they’re going to be testing that theory.  Our advantage in West Africa is that we own the multi client library for Angola. Its quite old but given the different prospects that people are going to start to look at we can do a lot of reprocessing to make it attractive. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So how do you view your opportunities that in West Africa with your position there relative to the competitiveness of the Brazilian market. 
Andrew Gould : I think its, well actually I have no complaints about our position in Brazil but I think that our overall competitive position in West Africa is probably stronger which is a matter of infrastructure, logistics, and presence and the time we’ve been there. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: And [inaudible] and OGX type deal where you support a smaller company and everything they do more or less in West Africa as well. 
Andrew Gould : In the deepwater we haven’t see that, we have seen it and we have done it in the shallower waters in Nigeria. 
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt 
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : Even with higher spending next year, big free cash, no net debt, talk to us about how you think about cash, your comfort levels around letting cash build, your urgency to do acquisitions, roll that all together for us.
Andrew Gould : Well we still are actively pursuing opportunities and acquisitions. That’s not necessarily a reason to build cash. We will keep the share creep from happening which means that anything we issue for employees stock will get more back and we agree at a Board meeting yesterday that we would review the dividend in the second half of the year. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : I would assume a review of the dividend is not for a lower dividend but a higher dividend. 
Andrew Gould : We have always said that we would never lower our dividend. We never put it at a level where we’d have to cut it. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : And then when you think about dividend as generally, I assume you’re talking recurring ongoing quarterly dividends, not special or one-time dividends.
Andrew Gould : No, ongoing quarterly, I’m not a great believer personally in special dividends. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : And then just to sort of put a point around the nearer term I think what I heard you saying in your discussion around seasonality etc. is that our expectation should be that Q1 earnings should be slightly lower because of the seasonality and we should see an international trough in Q2, on margins, and maybe some strength in the second half relative to the first half. 
Andrew Gould : I think that you should assume that in Q1 seasonality plus the absence of very strong software sales in Q4 will effect the results. And also don’t forget the absence of multi client in Q1, that will make a big difference. That Q2 will be the one where we’re all holding our breath to see what happens in the second half of the year.  So I’ve been avoiding trying to say it, but it is another year in two halves. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt : And then as we look to 2011, obviously the, Wall Street has a big expectations ramp in terms of estimates, care to comment on those. 
Andrew Gould : I think that, well its way too early to say, but I think that if oil prices remain where they are, and the economic recovery stays on track, then yes there will be a considerable increase in exploration and production spending in 2011. 
Malcolm Theobald:  So prior to closing the call I would like to mention that the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2010 earnings conference call will be held on Friday, April 23, 2010 at 9:00 am US Eastern time.

Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Kent. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2009 results conference call.  Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the third quarter and his comments on the outlook Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements we will welcome your questions.  However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.  Third quarter income was $0.65 per share, excluding the $0.17 of charges we recorded last quarter. This is down $0.03 sequentially and down $0.60 compared to the same quarter of last year. We continued to place a heavy focus on managing our cost base and have largely completed the headcount reductions that we announced last quarter.  Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services third quarter revenue was flat sequentially while WesternGeco revenue decreased 17%. Oilfield Services pre-tax operating income of $1 billion was the same as the prior quarter. Oilfield Services margins improved slightly by 41 basis points sequentially to 21%, as improvements in North America and Latin America were partially offset by slight declines in Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East/Asia. Overall, international margins in OFS were 24.7%.  By area, Oilfield Services sequential pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows: North America improved by 240 basis points to 3.4% on the increased activity in Canada following the seasonal spring breakup. This was partially offset by the impact of the decline in activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to operator caution during the hurricane season. Latin America increased by 70 basis points to 18.3%, primarily as a result of efforts to restructure the cost base in the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago geo market and increased IPM activity in Mexico/Central America. These improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in Brazil due to start up costs for new contracts. Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 23.7%, 53 basis points lower than last quarter primarily due to lower activity levels and a less favorable revenue mix in the North Sea and West and South Africa geo markets. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of higher revenues in the North Africa geo market and the more favorable revenue mix in Russia. Finally, Middle East/Asia fell by just 32 basis points to 31.7% as the impact of stronger activity in the Arabian geo market and the favorable revenue mix in Indonesia were offset by effects of lower revenue in the East Asia, Qatar, and Gulf geo markets. In addition, we have begun to see the effect of price concessions across the area.  At WesternGeco, pre-tax income of $61 million reflected a decrease in pre-tax margins of 421 basis points to 13.1%. This decrease was primarily due to lower multi-client client sales.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 19.5%. This was higher than last quarter excluding charges due to less favorable geographic mix of earnings. As a reminder, the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic of earnings, and as such we may experience volatility on a quarterly basis. Net debt was $660 million at the end of the quarter as compared to $990 million at the end of Q2. This improvement was driven by strong cash flow from operations. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $2.8 billion of committed debt facilities and commercial banks remained unused and were available at the end of September. This compares to short-term debt of only $1.2 billion, which, as a remainder, includes $320 million of our convertible debentures which will likely be converted to equity by the end of the second quarter next year. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $467 million of CapEx, $363 million of pension funding, and $276 million for acquisitions and minority interest investments. Additionally, during the quarter we were able to issue $450 million of notes due in 2013 at an interest rate of 3%. The proceeds from this issuance will be used to refinance existing debt obligations.  Oilfield Services CapEx is still expected to approach $1.9 billion in 2009, while WesternGeco is now expected to reach $490 million.  Our balance sheet remains very strong and continues to provide us with a tremendous amount of financial flexibility. And now I'll turn the conference over to Andrew. 
Andrew F. Gould: Good morning, everybody.  Oilfield Services revenue was flat with the second quarter as increases in both North and South America offset a further decline in the Middle East and Asia. As a result of this, coupled with the implementation of cost-cutting programs early in the year, overall margins increased slightly. In terms of technologies, revenue increases in IPM, testing services and well services were primarily offset by revenue declines and completions, drilling and measurements and wireline.  Looking at the areas in detail, activity in North America was unchanged sequentially as increased revenue in Canada from the muted post-spring breakup recovery was offset by decreased revenue in the United States. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico revenue was impacted by a slowdown in activity due to operator caution during the hurricane season and by a further decrease in shelf drilling activity as a result of the continued uneconomic natural gas equation. On land, revenue decreased as an improvement in oil-related activity was more than offset by pricing erosion in gas-related activity in the early part of the quarter. Alaska also recorded lower revenue due to a slowdown in activity for seasonal rig maintenance and operator budget constraints. Sequential growth in Latin America came from the finalization of certain contracts in the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago geo market that led to recognition of deferred revenue in addition to revenue from current quarter activities related to those contracts. Revenue also grew in the Mexico/Central America geo market from the start up of the AGG3 contract and from increased activity on other IPM projects. Europe/CIS/Africa was flat with the second quarter, where a combination of positive currency movements across the area, higher testing services product sales in North Africa, and stronger IPM activity in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea was offset by a number of factors. These included lower revenue in West and Southern Africa from reduced activity that primarily affected well services, a decrease in the North Sea from lower rig count and pricing that mostly impacted drilling and measurement services, and a fall in revenue in Libya on a reduced amount for testing services and well services technology as well as for completion products.  The North Sea revenue also decreased as a result of an incident in the Norwegian sector that resulted in a stimulation vessel being out of action for most of the quarter. The vessel re-started operations in mid-September. As I mentioned earlier, revenue fell sequentially in the Middle East/Asia. In East Asia, completion of several exploration-related campaigns led to lower demand for wireline testing services and well services. In Qatar, revenue decreased primarily due to the completion of several large offshore development projects that resulted in reduced demand for all technologies. In the Gulf geo market revenue fell on lower income that led to a decrease in drilling and measurements and wireline services.  East Mediterranean revenue dropped as a result of lower land activity that reduced demand for well services technology; however, these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the Arabian geo market revenue on strong gas-related activity that resulted in higher demand for well services and testing services. Weaker pricing also contributed to lower revenue.  At WesternGeco, sequential revenue declines were due to lower multi-client revenues in the quarter and the rollover of marine contracts from high-priced legacy backlog into newer lower- priced activity. The combination resulted in lower revenue and margins.  Recent contract awards demonstrate the value of Schlumberger's technology leadership and operational differentiation. These included an award in Denmark from Maersk Oil and Gas for open hole wireline under high pressure/high temperature conditions, in Russia for Artic Gas for a series of services north of the Artic Circle, in West Africa for subsea completion installations, particularly in Equatorial Guinea, and in the North Sea for Apache for electrical submersible pump systems based on previous excellent service delivery.  Two events during the quarter also demonstrated our continuing investment to support operations in growing regions.  First, in Saudi Arabia we announced the opening of a new reservoir completions manufacturing center in the Dammam Industrial City. Representing an investment of $25 million, the center houses a team of design and manufacturing engineers specialized in the production of down hole reservoir completions equipment. The center also provides a collaborative environment in which joint oil company and Schlumberger teams can develop and manufacture completion solutions for application across Saudi Arabia and the greater Middle East. The new center represents a further step in our infrastructure in the area, which includes the Dhahran Research Center opened in 2006 and the new Oilfield Services base in Dhahran commission in November, 2008.  Second, we also announced the signing of a joint cooperation agreement with Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro to build a key international research center on the university's campus. The center will focus on research and development activities in deepwater pre-salt environments, with emphasis on the development of geoscience software for the exploration of production center, new technologies to meet reservoir challenges in pre-salt environments, and the creation of a geophysical processing and interpretation center of excellence covering time lapse seismic and compliant electromagnetic and seismic measurements.  Our outlook for the reminder of 2009 assumes a continued modest recovery in North American gas drilling but no other significant improvement in service pricing. Overseas, while rig activity is stabilizing, seasonal factors, together with pricing concessions made in the first half of the year that are still being implemented, leave some risk of further small revenue declines. WesternGeco's improvement will depend on the level of fourth quarter multi-client sales. Looking further, we said in our second quarter outlook the shape of the economic recovery beyond 2009 and the subsequent recovery in oil and gas demand remain the determining factors for future activity increases. Since then, indications of inventory rebuilding across many industries, together with help from government stimuli, have helped to strengthen demand for both oil and gas. While uncertainties remain, notably the transition from current stimuli to industrial and consumer demand and the extent to which the recovery will be limited by high unemployment, the demand for oil and gas will increase somewhat over the coming months.  As a result, we see continuing stabilization of activity around the world; however, this will not be uniform across either geographies or for services by commodity type. We consider that world gas markets are oversupplied and will remain so for some time absent a strong recovery in industrial demand. Both new LNG capacity coming onstream, as well as ample storage and pent-up supply in North America, will serve to keep prices and activity low. In North America we feel the current slight recovery in drilling to be fragile and not likely to significantly improve service activity and pricing until late 2010.  For oil, the current robust price will lead operators to maintain their spending levels and this, coupled with the lowering of their cost structures, may produce some modest increases in activity. We see continued strength in deepwater areas and some increases in selected land markets. We also feel that a more robust commodity price will lead to some increase in seismic activity, although new marine capacity will continue to depress pricing. The worst, provided the economy continues to show signs of recovery, is behind us. And I'll now hand the call over to Malcolm.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Andrew. We will now open the call for questions. Kent?
Operator:  Great. Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Andrew, if you could provide us with some perspective, if you will, on two markets, one, Mexico. Clearly a lot being discussed in the press and [inaudible] in a period of, let's say, contemplation with regard to Chicontepec. What do you think the likely path Pemex takes with regard to Chicontepec and overall activity in 2010?  And then secondly with regard to Russia, what are your expectations there going forward?
Andrew F. Gould: Let me answer Russia first because that's easier. We think that there will be a fairly substantial increase in feet drilled, which is the measure we use to judge activity in Russia. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: And fairly substantial means what?
Andrew F. Gould: High double digit, from 10% onwards, but pricing will mean that the actual revenue transferization of that will probably be about half. Now in terms of Mexico, everyone has read as much as I've read about the questions that have been asked by the new national hydrocarbons authority and by the congress, so I think there is absolutely no doubt that Pemex will come with a revised strategy for Chicontepec. I do not know what that strategy will be, and if I did I don't think I would be at liberty to say so on this call.  But I think that one should assume that when there's that amount of noise - and as you probably know, Bill, there are articles every day in the Mexican press about this - Pemex will have to look at their strategy.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: And then secondly with regard to seismic, you're waxing a bit more optimistic with regard to activity and sensibly so given what's happening with oil prices. Can you elaborate a little bit in terms of what you're hearing from your customers, tenders that you're seeing, and does your modestly improved outlook for seismic encompass both contract and multi-client? 
Andrew F. Gould: The answer to the last part is yes, contract and multi-client. What we're seeing in contract is the fact that, as you know, operators compiled large portfolios of new licenses during the last four or five years, and there are people who are wanting to do contract seismic because they have commitments and people who want to do contract seismic because they think they can take opportunity at much lower pricing to obtain seismic vessels or crews. And in terms of multi-client, it's always a poker game until the end of the year, but I agree with you that higher prices should give a fairly satisfactory level of spend on multi-client.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Equity income was up pretty sharply quarter-on-quarter. Do we know what drove that?
Simon Ayat: The equity income, we have two things on that line. We have the net interest expense and then equity from the minority shareholder, and this is just the usual thing.  No, I don't have the detail for the quarter-on-quarter. I'll look through it and probably by the end of the call we can give you color on it. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: Andrew, can you talk about the mix this quarter, especially in the Middle East/Asia, where the mix seemed to have gone against you with less exploration as well as the completion of a few offshore contracts, yet margins actually held up pretty well. What does this say about margins going forward as the mix potentially improves?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, if I can deal with the mix question first, Dan, our position in Middle East/Asia in exploration and development means that when rigs go down we suffer disproportionately perhaps compared to a lot of our competitors because of our presence in exploration and offshore development. And in terms of pricing, the Middle East has done a fantastic job of pulling in their costs. So despite the fairly substantial drop in offshore rig count, particularly for offshore development in Qatar, they've done a really good job of managing their cost base.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: Okay, but I would assume that the outlook for margins here is more positive than it was last quarter?
Andrew F. Gould: It will depend to some extent on how the rig mix evolves, but generally it should going forward start to be a bit better, the rig mix. 
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: On the last call you said $70 oil at the end of the year was the threshold that ENPs were looking for to take their budgets higher. We're now at $80, so could you give us some guess at what you would expect international spending to be up next year and what markets you might expect to be the strongest?
Andrew F. Gould: That's a long question, but let me deal with the first part. The first part, don't forget it's not the spot price of oil that encourages my customers to change their spending; it's the notion that an increase in the price has reached some level of stability. So last quarter I talked about $70 to $75, and I think today that most of my customers are still budgeting slightly below that. And I think that, if they gain confidence probably in the first half of next year that this price is sustainable, then they will increase spending. But today I think the increases we're seeing are inactivity based on their capacity to obtain more activity at lower prices within their existing budgets. So, yes, obviously $80 oil would eventually, if it stays at $80, lead them to increase their budgets. I don't think they're ready to make that call yet.  And I'll leave the other one, if I may, Dan.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: The very first question I have is sort of a follow up, I guess, to what you've already been asked, but I see that a number of projects were completed in your Middle East/Asia region. I also kind of wanted to get your thoughts on the recent reactivation of seven of the 35 halted OPEC projects and how this might impact the sector if suddenly all of them, plus the other NOC projects around the world, were greenlighted in 2010?
Andrew F. Gould: Sorry, seven of 35 what projects? I missed it. Sorry.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: Of the OPEC projects that were delayed at the beginning of this year have been greenlighted. 
Andrew F. Gould: In oil or gas?
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: I think they're across the board. They weren't specific in their release.
Andrew F. Gould: The sustained or, if you like, moving forward of projects in Middle East OPEC for gas we're seeing very clearly. And for oil, no, I haven't seen any reactivation of a major project so far. But obviously if prices get sustained at these levels, some members of OPEC - and I think it's very important to say some - will increase their activity, but not the people who have large surface capacity.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: My follow up question to that would be how comfortable do you think the world should be with OPEC's 6 million barrels [inaudible] capacity?
Andrew F. Gould: Comfortable in what sense, Alan? Sorry.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: Being comfortable in it actually existing or it being under a level of decline while sitting there. 
Andrew F. Gould: Oh, I think that the capacity in the countries where it exists is not going to be subject to an extremely fast decline, so the decline is more in other places than in the places where they have the surface capacity. 
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: That's kind of what I meant in the sense of it being the cushion.
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. No, I think the cushion is fairly intact. But that doesn't mean that reduced investment in other places will not eat into the overall production capacity of OPEC.
Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets: And the other follow up I had was on the seismic side. Most people think of seismic as kind of rising in lead cycle and, given the state of oil and gas resources and demand - we ended sort of on a demand side, not on a supply side end of the cycle - I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts on the timing and magnitude of a seismic recovery if we kind of grind higher from here?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that the seismic activity is even more sensitive to the absolute level of the oil price than the rest of oilfield services because seismic, particularly exploration seismic, is a cash expense; it doesn't bring any income. So I would say that the strength of the recover in seismic is really going to depend very much on the absolute level of the oil price going forward. But, as I said earlier, the capacity of the seismic industry to capitalize on that is going to be somewhat limited for a period of time by the new marine capacity that's coming into the market.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Andrew, obviously a lot of moving pieces. If we just would assume that as we step forward into Q4 and Q1 and that revenues were flat, I'm trying to understand the cost-cutting impact. I know we're not doing more, but is there still some follow on impact to be felt from the cost cuts that you've done already and could you help us quantify that?
Andrew F. Gould: I actually think that the impact of cost cutting in the next six months could be outweighed by the concessions we've made in price. Actually, the balance is so fine, Dan, I don't know which way it's going to go.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: So it sounds like basically from here margins would be pretty flatish if activity was flatish?
Andrew F. Gould: That's what we're hoping for. But, as I say, it's very difficult across the spread of Schlumberger, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere, to judge whether or not the pricing concessions we've made are going to outweigh the cost cutting that we're doing, and today I would be a little bit pessimistic on that. Price will overrule cost to a certain extent.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: That kind of plays into your discussion around potentially a little bit of further margin erosion?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, yes.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: You're cash flowing a significant amount down here kind of on the bottom, if you will. Help us understand next year maybe direction of your CapEx budget, and are there any other big requirements for cash next year? We've funded a bunch of pension this quarter. Are there any other big lumps of money we need to spend next year?
Andrew F. Gould: No, I think that you will see CapEx increase fairly substantially next year, if only because the number of deepwater rigs coming on is higher next year than it is this year. Actually, we have made pension contributions this year of around about $1 billion; I don't think we'll be doing that again next year.
Simon Ayat: No, it's [inaudible]. As we said earlier in the year, we dedicated a big part of our cash flow to refund our pensions, and we did so. We don’t have that kind of an expense next year.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: For clarification, Andrew, you said that your CapEx will be up a bunch next year because of deepwater?
Andrew F. Gould: Schlumberger's CapEx will be up, yes.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Okay, so the $1.9 billion in Oilfield CapEx will go higher?
Andrew F. Gould: I think so, yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Andrew, I'll give you kind of an open-ended question and let you kind of run with it. Over the past year I think a lot of us were trying to benchmark the downturn relative to prior cycle periods, and here we are in the early stages of stabilization. I wonder if you can give us your perspective on how you would benchmark recovery, maybe in the context of coming off the lows of '99 or 2001, and if you can kind of give us some breakdown between how you think it might play out internationally in that context as well as in North America?
Andrew F. Gould: So first I think that everyone needs to understand that the state of the general economy in this downturn is much worse even than it was in '86 and bears no comparison to '99 or 2001. And therefore there is this underlying question that everybody needs to ask themselves about demand. And if you remember, if you look back, the collapse in 1986 was due to a huge collapse in the demand for oil in the years before 1986.  So there is this underlying question which is still fundamental to the oil and gas business - what is happening to demand? And, you know, we have seen some encouraging signs, but we're not back into high demand growth and, in fact, if you looked at presentations I've made recently or people are making recently, the assumption on world GDP is absolutely fundamental to where demand is going to go. And if it's 3% or 4% or 5%, the amount of demand for oil, particularly, is going to be substantially different. So that's interesting. The second thing is that, unlike 1986, for oil there is an overhang of 6 or 7 million barrels or whatever it is, but it is nothing like the overhang that existed in 1986 and, as you know, the ability of the industry to renew the production base is a lot less flexible than it was in 1986. So in terms of the need to sustain activity, any growth in demand coupled with a relative modest overhang of production will mean that demand will act as an accelerator on investment. So that's why I made all these remarks in my comments about the level of general investment. So for oil, there's a fundamental difference in the economy and there's a fundamental difference in the supply situation.  Now for gas, I think we're in a new world. I do not know how this world is going to work out. Why are we in a new world? We're in a new world firstly because there's a huge amount of LNG that's coming onstream, and secondly because we have unlocked a new source of domestic gas production in the United States which means that we can turn the taps on gas very fast.  And I think that it is significant and it's really interesting to watch how this is going to play out, but the ratio of gas to oil prices has not been so wide for the last 10 years. And this can have all sorts of implications on demand, but it can also have all sorts of implications on investment because don't forget in Europe gas prices are indexed to oil. Sorry, that's a very rambling answer, but you asked for it.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: So in the overall context of some of the things you put here, though, it seems like there's been - I don't want to put words in your mouth - but it seems like there's been a pretty significant shift in tone because, thinking of our call in the second quarter, there were some concerns about rig activity actually in the international market declining through parts of 2010. Now, if I understand or interpret your comments correctly, it looks like the international rig count is going to stabilize here some in the fourth quarter, with a potential improvement going out into next year. 
Andrew F. Gould: Let me repeat what I said to the previous question.  I don't think our customers have seen this high an oil price stable for long enough for them to change their investment plans yet. But if it stays stable at these higher levels for the next six months, they will change their plans.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: And they'll change them quickly enough to effect 2010?
Andrew F. Gould: The back end of 2010, yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: You described your thoughts about margins over the next six months; can you push it out to the next 15 months, what happens afterwards? Do you think cost measurement - I mean, I understand just from what you've said the activity levels are a little bit unclear, but are you still thinking international margins come down by some multiple 100 basis points? 
Andrew F. Gould: We never said they would. The only thing I said was that we didn't see the same levels of decline as other companies have been putting out.
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Okay. I perhaps misunderstood you.
Andrew F. Gould: And I repeat that, Geoff.
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: So generally speaking, margins look kind of teetering on the edge, maybe down a little bit, maybe up a little bit. You would apply that to throughout 2010? 
Andrew F. Gould: At the moment, yes.
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: On the cycle question, again, maybe I misremember here, but I recall you some time ago speculating about the cycles in the industry maybe changing and becoming shorter and sharper. Did I misremember?
Andrew F. Gould: No, you're absolutely correct, and I think that's exactly what we may well experience provided demand holds up for oil. I think the equation has changed for gas partly because of LNG and partly because of the capacity of the industry to unlock unconventional sources of gas. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: On the cycle question, should we be prepared for this kind of violent cycles to repeat themselves in your mind?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, it's going to depend on the economy, Geoff.  I mean, really, really, the sensitivity of oil demand to 1% of world GDP is huge, so it really depends at what point economic growth accelerates and to what extent it accelerates.  And one of the factors that has changed in the last quarter which is, you know, giving us all a bit more confidence is that GDP revisions for 2010 and even 2009 have been consistently upwards since July. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: And what is the significance to Schlumberger of your view that natural gas markets are structurally oversupplied?
Andrew F. Gould: I think North American gas activity will recover to a certain extent at some stage, but the sanctioning of large new LNG developments overseas is likely to go a bit slower than maybe we thought a year ago. A lot of them will get done anyway because we're talking 25-year projects, but there may be some hesitation to sanction some of them until there's a clearer view on gas. Now if demand for gas evolves as all the forecasting agencies say it will, this surplus gets reabsorbed by about 2013 or 2014. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: And this is good or bad for Schlumberger?
Andrew F. Gould: Anything that reduces activity is not good for Schlumberger, but I would say it's reasonably neutral.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital.
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Andrew, my questions are about Iraq in two parts. Number one, are you happy where you are today in terms of your on the ground presence and infrastructure given how you see the business unfolding? And secondly, about Iraq - and I know we may differ on this - but if there were to be several multi hundred million dollar orders in Iraq next year, would Schlumberger be equipped to service them?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, as I said before, we are currently putting an infrastructure in place. I am very happy with the progress of putting the infrastructure in place. And if several multi hundred million dollar bids emerge, we will be in a position to answer them, yes.
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Secondly, Andrew, I think it was one of your competitors on their call talked about how competitive the Brazilian market had become. Compared with other international markets, how do you see the sort of erosion in pricing on tenders in Brazil and how do you see it going from here?
Andrew F. Gould: I don't think we've noticed any significant difference in the level of competition in Brazil compared to anywhere else. I think the Brazilians are extremely good at procurement, so I'm sure the pressure will continue. But I don't think it's any competitive than any other major offshore market, Jim.  Are you talking about something specific? 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: No, I was just talking in regards to a conference call by a company that earlier had been done. I think they were talking in general that they thought that tenders had become more competitive out there, and I was just wondering what you had observed relative to that.
Andrew F. Gould: No, I don't think we've seen any dramatic increase in the level of competitiveness. Brazil's always been extremely competitive and obviously, with the current interest there is in the country, it is. But I don't think it's something exceptional.
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Okay. And, Andrew, now that the IntelliServ deal has been completed with National Oilwell, could you give your views on what you think the commercial potential is of that technology and how quickly it will unfold?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think the first commercial potential of it is for it to arrive at the same level of reliability as mud pulse telemetry, which it's almost there but not quite. And the second is going to be much longer term - it's the capacity to develop new measurements in string, particularly for drilling optimization. That will profit from the fact that you have not simply an uplink that's very fast but perhaps even more important a downlink that's very fast. Because when we transmit commands today by mud pulse telemetry it takes a long time for them to get to the tool because they have to go all the way down the mud column.  But I wouldn't look for a revenue effect, a substantial revenue effect in the first couple of years. 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Tell me if you disagree, but this strikes me as, over an intermediate to longer term time horizon, something that could be hugely significant for Schlumberger. 
Andrew F. Gould: Otherwise we would not have gone into the joint venture, but yes, the capacity to communicate at those speeds and the capacity to extend the range of what our sensors can do because you have this high bandwidth not only at the bottom of the hole but also all the way up the hole could be - could be - a very significant development. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Andrew, you mentioned pricing pressure in seismic. I presume you refer to contract seismic. Are you offering any kind of discounts at the moment on multi-client?
Andrew F. Gould: No, nothing significant, I don't think.  Discounts in multi-client depend on two things: They firstly depend on which part of the library you're trying to market. If it's a very old totally amortized part of library that you already sold 15 times, you may be prepared to discount it. If it's a new high-value wire survey that you've spent a lot of money doing advanced processing on, you're unlikely to discount it. And you're successful depending on whether you shop the survey in the right place.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: The overlay of EM into a multi-client library, do you think that's going to be much impact on pricing and margins for multi-client relative to your competitors?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I certainly think that some of the images we can produce and are producing in some places through overlaying not just EM but EM and other measurements on our multi-client library give the value of the data a huge uplift.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Are you able to overlay old data with EM and then get an uplift in the value?
Andrew F. Gould: It depends. We will do that selectively where we think the market will buy it.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Then a second question on exploration budgets amongst your customers in general, [inaudible] the most discretionary part of the budgets, do you get a sense that people have been underspending in the first half of the year relative to the full year exploration budget? 
Andrew F. Gould: I think so. I mean, we have seen a very clear pickup in the number of inquiries or the number of requests for tenders. So obviously I think the purse strings have been let loose a little bit as we move towards the end of this year and the beginning of next year. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities: A couple of mentions of Venezuela in the press release here this morning. You also said you've gotten the cost structure there in line, but it also looked like a couple of instances of activity, including, I guess, to quote you, close cooperation with PDVSA. What's the general outlook in that market? It's been quiet, for obvious reasons, for awhile. Are you seeing a pickup there? Are you wading back in? Is PDVSA wading back into the market? And, most importantly, are you getting paid for it?
Andrew F. Gould: I would say that the progress we've made on receivables is extremely satisfactory.  I think PDVSA is coming back into the market for services gradually. I don't think it will have a startling affect in 2009. And probably more than a lot of markets it will be extremely sensitive to what the oil price is as we go forward. But certainly, yes, there's more interest to Venezuela than we've seen for some time.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities: And then I guess the other market that's been troublesome in Latin America has been Argentina. Any signs of progress there?
Andrew F. Gould: Not from our standpoint; not a great deal, no.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mark Brown - Pritchard Capital Partners, LLC.
Mark Brown - Pritchard Capital Partners, LLC: In terms of fracturing in North America, do you have any comments on where you see pricing going and where you see capacity going overall.
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that, as we said in our press release, that pricing has probably bottomed late in the third quarter. I don't think we'll see any substantial increase until the second half of next year. And a lot of the capacity, I think, will overhang the market for another year and a half or so.  But these large fracs eke up capacity fairly fast and actually increase the cost of maintaining the equipment fairly dramatically, so there is a possibility - though it's only a possibility - that we actually work down the backlog of pumps or frac equipment perhaps faster than we've done in previous upturns. But I still think any significant tightening of the market is towards the end of next year.
Mark Brown - Pritchard Capital Partners, LLC: And in North America one of the few markets where you don't have the largest market share for Oilfield Services in general and at the same time your commentary is somewhat guarded in terms of the speed of a recovery, is this a market that you see yourself focusing on in terms of taking advantage of the service intensity going forward?
Andrew F. Gould:  I don't think we have any plans, inclination, desire or anything else to decrease our position in North America. On the contrary, I think that if we were able to do it at a reasonable capital cost, we would increase it because it's an extremely important market in the way that both technology and operational capacity develops. We would always want to be a player.
Mark Brown - Pritchard Capital Partners, LLC: My final question is on the regulations that have been proposed on fracturing and the ingredients used. What is your opinion on what the probability of those regulations getting put in place, and could you comment on your coming out to propose the proactive disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that, like everything else that surrounds this sort of issue, where there is a public concern, which is the regulators, then eventually some form of regulation is going to emerge, and therefore it seemed to us very important to be part of the discussion rather than to, if you like, not cooperate in the process of establishing what a regulation might be. Now, what the final form of it will take I actually don't think we know yet, but I'm pretty sure that there will be some form of new regulation in order to satisfy the authorities and the public's desire to know that what is being done is safe. And that seems to me a perfectly natural thing to want.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: I was wondering just one simple question. On the $276 million of acquisition spending in the third quarter, was there anything other than IntelliServ of significance there?
Andrew F. Gould: No, it would have been very small. There were a couple of things, but they were very small.
Simon Ayat: Minority interests, small ones.
Andrew F. Gould: Very small.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: Then shifting to North America again, one further question. In terms of the prospects for recovery in pricing, we all know if the rig count increases there's really no magic level of the rig count at which you start to having pricing power, but if you're sized today for the market in North America and the rig count begins to increase, activity picks up, and you have to go and hire and begin to incur some expenses in meeting that higher level of demand, is there a potential to get pricing improvement at that point or in your view is it further out until we get to a substantially higher level of activity in North America?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think it depends very much what type of activity it is. If it's a continuation of what we've seen in the Haynesville, for example, where actually the types of service and the complexity and the intensity is quite high, then I think pricing will react quite fast because there'll be a limited field of players that customers will want to use. If it's just general spread across the board, then it will obviously take much longer.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: And your expectation is the type of recovery, would it focus most likely on these high service intensive shale plays like the Haynesville and Marcellus?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, I do, because I think that's where the highest initial production indexes come and are going to continue to come. Until gas prices get much higher, you're not going to have a return to the shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and things like that. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: Andrew, I wanted to just ask a little bit more about Latin America margins. Was there material impact recognized in that deferred revenue on the margins in the quarter?
Andrew F. Gould: No.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: So further, and kind of like Geoff I may have mishead, but I know we were kind of thinking that as IPM revenues grew that because of the pass through component it would put some pressure on the margin in that area. So are we in a position where the incremental activity spread across is expanding margins?
Andrew F. Gould: That's what happened in Latin America in this quarter, yes.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: So your expectation there, while your comments earlier about pricing remain, is that even if you will see an increase, that is not going to negatively impact the margins?
Andrew F. Gould: No. But I would remind you of what I said. We don't know what Pemex is going to do at this stage of the game, and Pemex is by far the largest IPM customer in South America - not the only one, but the largest.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: Shifting to seismic and the comments of potentially commodity prices driving incremental activity, but mixing that with the incremental capacity in marine, we might get activity but would you push out any - now, just contract; multi-client's separate - and that swings the number? What is your commentary on margin on contract further out?
Andrew F. Gould: You know, higher utilization will help margin even from where it is now given the extent to which prices have declined. Obviously we don't have the same leverage effect that we had when we were at fully capacity, but when marine seismic was at full capacity. So there will be some effect, but actually I think for a period of time fairly minimal. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: And would you give us the same kind of perspective on WesternGeco CapEx? I think earlier you were talking about substantial CapEx; that was more Oilfield Services, I suppose. What's directionally 2010?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, don't forget we're still commissioning some Eastern eco boats. So, I mean, I don't know yet, but I'm going to guess that it'll be flat with 2009.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Brad Handler - Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: I guess a few of us are trying to tease you out a little on the margin guess for North America, so maybe I'll just ask that directly, perhaps if you're expecting a little bit of favorable mix just in terms of the exposure to the shale plays? And presumably you're taking share there. Is it reasonable in your outlook to think that you are looking for some decent incremental margin?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think you have to remember that our presence in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater is extremely significant to our margin performance in North America. And to the extent that we had the hurricane precautionary measures in the third quarter, the volume of work in the Gulf of Mexico declined considerably. And all things being equal, it's likely to increase considerably in the fourth quarter, so that can have a positive effect on the overall North America margin. And on land we think we saw the bottom. On the other hand, we think the recovery in Canada is going to be fairly limited compared to what it's been in the past. But if you're asking the question overall, yes, we would say that there will be some improvement in margins in North America going forward. But in volume terms don't forget U.S. land is by far the largest volume, and therefore until that pricing moves they're not going to be hugely significant.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: That makes sense, but I guess, again, whether we define it as just because you're working the Haynesville or perhaps you're optimistic about product mix? 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: That helps the U.S. land outlook too, right?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: Just one follow up on Latin America, then. You reference start up costs in Brazil. Can you help us calibrate how significant that is? Presumably the outlook for the fourth quarter - 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, it's quite significant because, if you remember, we announced in our second quarter press release that we had been awarded an IPM contract to manage initially two and later four semi-submersibles for a Brazilian company called OGX, so mobilizing semis and start ups on that size of project is quite a significant number. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: It sounds like that actually may be going to five rigs?
Andrew F. Gould: You heard that before me. I don't know that yet.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: But in terms of our thinking about the fourth quarter margin, then, it's reasonable to assume that there's a little bit of pressure that's relieved in Latin America that way?
Andrew F. Gould: Absent any immediate reaction in Mexico, yes.
Operator:  Your last question comes from James Carroll - Loomis, Sayles.
James Carroll - Loomis, Sayles : Two years ago, I think, at the last analyst meeting you talked about a couple new products, an in situ fluid analyzer and an in situ coring tool. The coring tool had a unique advantage over existing technology in that it would do quick turnaround of full size cores ready for lab measurement. I'm just curious. We haven't heard anything about it at all. Can you give us a little update on what's going on there?
Andrew F. Gould: I can tell you that the in situ fluid tool is doing extremely well, and the coring tool is still in field tests. 
James Carroll - Loomis, Sayles :  Can you just give us some idea about the speed and likelihood of North American shale drilling and competition technology as it relates to reservoir characterization and enhancement moving into the international markets? Where might it go? How soon might it go there?
Andrew F. Gould: I think that's quite a complex answer, Jim. First, it will go there, right? But secondly, it is no accident that shale gas was first exploited in Texas and Louisiana because in order to do that you need a huge amount of oilfield service infrastructure. And in a lot of places in the world that infrastructure just doesn't exist, which obviously has cost implications for the initial period in which you produce that shale gas. The second thing is if you look at a Google map of Dallas/Fort Worth and you look at the well density, there are a lot of places in the world - for example, in Germany would be a good example - where that just will not be permitted.  So there's going to have to be some modification of the exploitation method for it to really fit into a lot of other places around the world. If I can give you one example of a place where there's no infrastructure, Pakistan has a huge amount of shale gas, but there is not the infrastructure in Pakistan to exploit it today.  So my view is it will happen, it will be more expensive, and it'll probably take a little bit longer than a lot of people seem to be prognosticating at this point in time.
Malcolm Theobald: On behalf of the Schlumberger management team I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. 
Andrew F. Gould: Can you hold on one second, please? Simon can clarify the equity position in the quarter. Simon?
Simon Ayat: This is a question from Bill Herbert earlier on. The net equity did improve quarter to quarter. It is really across the board from the different affiliated company investments that we have, but notably the Arabian Drilling Company, which is a drilling joint venture we have in Saudi Arabia. I just wanted to clarify it.
Malcolm Theobald: Okay, Kent.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time then, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir. 
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Ken. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2009 results conference call. Today’s call is being hosted from Paris where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday.  Before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request.  Joining me for today’s call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew’s overview of the second quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter’s financial results. After the prepared statements, we will welcome your questions.  And now I’ll turn the call over to Simon. 
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter income from continuing operations excluding charges was $0.68 per share, down $0.10 sequentially and $0.48 compared to the same quarter of last year. We continue to actively manage our cost base. In this regard, we have continued to reduce our headcount which resulted in charges of $0.07 in the quarter, primarily relating to severance.  Additionally, as a result of these workforce reductions, we were required to record a non-cash pension and other post-retirement benefit curtailment charges in the quarter of $0.10. These headcount reductions are expected to be largely completed by the end of the third quarter.  Turning to the business segments, oilfield services second quarter revenue fell by 9% sequentially, while WesternGeco revenue increased 1%.  Oilfield services generated $1 billion in pretax operating income, down $233 million sequentially with margins declining by 245 basis points to 20.6%.  By area, oilfield services sequential pretax operating margins highlights were as follows.  North America declined to 1% on the heavy pricing pressure across most of the area and the sharp drop in activity, primarily in U.S. land and in Canada. The sequential margin decline is equally attributable to U.S. land and Canada.  Internationally, margins were at 25.1%, a decline of 170 basis points from Q1.  Latin America decreased by 206 basis points to 17.6%, primarily due to a less favorable revenue mix coupled with cost inflation in Brazil, currency revaluation losses and pricing pressure in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and the impact of the lower activity in the Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobego. These decreases were partially offset by the increased IPM activity in Mexico Central America.  Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 24.2%, which was 172 basis points lower than last quarter, primarily due to the lower activity levels and less favorable revenue mix, Nigeria and [Gulf of Guinea], West and South Africa, and the North Sea. These decrease were partially offset by an increase in Russia as a result of the improved activity levels.  Finally, Middle East/Asia slipped 107 basis points to 32.1%, primarily as a result of the lower overall activity in the area.  At WesternGeco, pretax income was $97 million, reflecting an increase in pretax margins of 739 basis points to 17.3%. The increase was primarily due to higher multi-client sales and improved profitability in marine as cost reductions initiatives more than offset the impact of the lower revenue.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges was 18.2%, and including the charges it was 19.8%. The rate was lower than last quarter due to the substantially lower proportion of pretax earnings in North America. The ETR for the year is expected to be in the lower 20s. As a reminder, the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings and as such, we may experience volatility on a quarterly basis.  Net debt was $990 million at the end of the quarter, an improvement of $537 million from Q1. This improvement was driven by strong cash flows from operations. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $2.3 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remained unused and well available at the end of June. This compared to short-term debt of only $1.6 billion, which includes $321 million of our convertible debentures, which are now classified as short-term.  Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $503 million of CapEx, $229 million of pension funding, and $186 million of acquisitions. We did not buy back any of our stock during the quarter. Oilfield services CapEx is expected to approach $1.9 billion in 2009, while WesternGeco is now expected to reach $530 million, which includes approximately $225 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels.  In summary, our balance sheet remains very strong and provides us with a significant amount of financial flexibility.  And now I’ll turn the conference over to Andrew. 
Andrew F. Gould: Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. Schlumberger's second quarter revenue fell 7.8% sequentially to $5.53 billion. Compared to the first quarter, the overall sequential rate of revenue decline slowed as a further precipitous drop in North America was offset by slowing rates of decline and some recovery in other parts of the world, including Russia, where revenue recovered noticeably due to seasonal trends and improving activity.  In North America, gas drilling in both the U.S. and Canada reached a five-year low as demand remained weak and storage levels remained way above the seasonal averages. While production has begun to show some decline and summer demand has been strong, it will still require a further substantial increase in demand, particularly in the industrial and power generation sectors to stimulate and sustain higher levels of drilling.  Looking at the areas in detail and starting with North America, the U.S. land geo-market recorded a further steep drop in revenue as the rig count declined approximately 27% and as pricing continued to erode.  Revenue in Canada also dropped significantly due to the impact of the seasonal spring break-up, the general reduction in land drilling activity, and the effect of significant pricing pressure.  In the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, however, revenue fell more modestly as lower pricing and further weakening on the shelf drilling activity were partially offset by slightly higher deepwater activity.  In the Latin American area, the Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobego geo-markets were the sharpest sequential revenue decrease as a result of lower activity and a revenue deferral pending finalization of certain contracts. This decrease, however, was somewhat offset by an increase in the Mexico and Central America geo-market as integrated project management activity and efficiency both increased.  With Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue in Russia grew sequentially on the seasonal rebound of offshore activity in the East among generally improved activity levels in both East and West Siberia. This growth was also supported through higher sales of artificial lift and completions products.  In North Africa, revenue grew from strong demand for testing services and completions products. These promising factors, however, were more than offset by reduced demand for drilling and measurements and wireline services in Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea in West and Southern Africa geomarkets, in addition to lower drilling and measurements in well services activities in the Caspian and North Sea geomarkets.  Lower Schlumberger information solutions software sales, as well as reduced demand for drilling and measurements, wireline and testing technologies in Continental Europe also contributed to the overall area sequential revenue decline.  Lastly in the Middle East and Asia area, sequential revenue fell primarily due to lower activity in the Gulf geomarket, as well as in the East Mediterranean, Arabian, Indonesia, Australia, Papua New Guinea and India geomarkets. Pricing pressure also began to impact revenue across the area.  These decreases, however, were partially offset by an increase in revenue in East Asia on strong exploration related demand for testing services, wireline, and well services, and a rebound in activity in the China, Japan, Korea geomarket following the winter slowdown in the first quarter.  At WesternGeco, there was some recovery in multi-client sales both in North America and overseas, although this together with increased activity in land, was offset by weaker Marine revenues. Marine pricing continued to decline due to excess capacity in the market.  Several new marine and land contracts were booked during the quarter, giving better visibility on the next few months. However, multi-client sales remain difficult to forecast until there is better visibility on year-end oil prices.  Against this background, we have continued to take action to right-size our operations without diminishing our capacity to react to market changes. Overall our operating cost base declined approximately $300 million compared to the first quarter as cost reduction programs continued to be implemented.  Careful management of both working capital and investment led to the liquidity improvement that Simon described.  Our outlook for the remainder of 2009 assumes some stability but no major increase in North American natural gas rig count before 2010 and as a result, service pricing will remain depressed. Overseas, further activity declines will occur but will be limited, while the pricing concessions made in the first half of the year will affect revenues in the second half. The current volatility in the oil price makes it unlikely that our customers will sanction any major increases in expenditure.  We are aware that a number of projects are continuing to be postponed or cancelled. We are also concerned that higher finding and development costs of new supply, coupled with lower oil and gas prices and more restricted credit markets, is stifling investment flows. This situation, if it persists, will lead to inadequate supply when demand growth returns.  The shape of the economic recovery beyond 2009 and the consequent recovery in oil and gas demand remain the determining factors for future activity increases.  Thank you and I will now hand the call back to Malcolm. 
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Andrew. Ken, we will now open the call for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Andrew, at the end of the first quarter, you referenced that the cycle was progressing very similar to prior cycle periods and that that would lead you to reason that the international markets from a volume standpoint could lead lower into 2010 and I noticed in the commentary that you had here today that your international reference points were really focused on the second half of 2009, so I was wondering if you could kind of update us on your thoughts as to whether your thoughts have changed and if so, how as you kind of look out beyond 2009 from an international volume standpoint. 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I don’t think my thoughts have substantially changed. If there is an element of doubt in predicting beyond the end of the year, it is the fairly rapid recovery that is taking place in the oil price. As I said in the comments this time, I think that there’s too much volatility in the oil price at the moment to sanction much increase in spending but if at the end of the year it persists at the higher end of the range that we’ve seen so far this year, then I do think that it might, if you like, not lead to the same reduction in activity next year that I was perhaps originally thinking of.  But it really, really, does depend on where the oil price is at the end of the year and not where it is now. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. That’s great, I appreciate that color. Now, my follow-up is you made some explicit reference here to some deferrals of revenues in Venezuela and we know obviously the mess that country has been. Can you give us your updated view on what you see as the prospects of any recovery in Venezuela? And can you update us on the receivable situation there, please?
Andrew F. Gould: During the quarter, we made very satisfactory progress on the receivables situation. And we also made considerable progress on the renewal of three major contracts but we were not able to book the revenue in the second quarter because the actual inking hasn’t been done and therefore there was a fairly large sum of -- fairly large amount of revenue that was deferred to the third quarter.  As to the overall levels of activity in Venezuela over the coming months, it’s a little early for me to say what I think [Pedevesa] is going to do but certainly the general situation in terms of receivables and contracts has shown a marked improvement over where we were at the end of Q1. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: If I could ask quickly on the OGX contract, and maybe talk about the differences between this structure and a typical IPM contract and whether or not there are other offshore opportunities like this out there?
Andrew F. Gould: So the difference is that whereas what we are providing in the OGX contract is very similar to what we would provide in a classic IPM, obviously the size of the amount and the risk involved means that we cannot take the same risk as we do in land IPM contracts. So this is somewhere between IPM and bundled services. So there’s not perhaps the same scope for incremental due to performance but the actual rate, the remuneration is a lot better than it would be in a basic IPM contract and we are providing a lot of the technical services around the development, as we would do in IPM.  And yes, there are other opportunities of this type. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: In terms of market size, if I think about IMP opportunities on land versus this type of thing offshore, is this an emergent market, is this a big market that is just -- you know, you get a little bit of share into? What’s the penetration rate? 
Andrew F. Gould: I think there are two -- so firstly, I don’t think this is a huge market. It’s obviously a very profitable market because it’s deep water. I think that the market falls into two types of market. The first is the OGX type where there is a definite wish to harness this Schlumberger technical expertise. The second type where this occurs is the remote market where a customer doesn’t have any infrastructure whatsoever and rather building a complete infrastructure, so this would typically be more in exploration or the delineation than in development, they will ask Schlumberger to manage a lot more of the process than we would in a normal offshore operation. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Great. Second question on Russia -- I’m intrigued by your comments that the improvement was not just seasonal. Would you care to elaborate and perhaps talk about how you would characterize Russia today in the recovery?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that -- to be honest, there were two events which are not seasonal. The first is the fact that the Ruble exchange rate improved considerably against the dollar. And the second is that the Russian oil companies who count in Rubles, obviously their first quarter results were huge. Therefore, there is more cash to invest and perhaps a greater willingness to invest than there was in the fourth quarter of last year.  So I think that it’s probably very definitely sustainable through the rest of this year; in addition, I understand there’s a probably change in the tax law, so I think that while it’s not going to be gangbusters, there is the scope of considerably more investment in Russia than we originally thought. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: That’s great. Thanks, Andrew. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. Andrew, you mentioned that it sounds like you are quite concerned about the 2010 cost outlook for oil supply, given the current delays in investment trends that you are seeing out there. Would you care to elaborate a little bit more because we just had the IA come out and increase their estimates on an OPEC production and could you just sort of talk a little bit about how you might differ or agree or what you see?
Andrew F. Gould: Well actually the thing that worries me more than anything else, and that’s why when I answered Kurt’s question, I stressed the level of the oil price so much, is our customers’ cash flows because even our very largest customers are having to borrow or dip into their war chests to sustain their spending and they will only go on doing that for a certain period of time. And therefore if we don’t have a fairly substantial improvement in the oil price, or by the end of this year then the risk is that the cash flows will be such that they will not actually increase at all in 2010. So that’s why I am so insistent that it hinges on the level of the oil price at the end of this year.  Now, in terms of supply, you have seen the easy stuff go away, the heavy oil and the tar sands and all the rest of it, which is a fairly substantial chunk of production that was originally included in the 2012 estimate, and I think what we are seeing now is a very definite caution on the part of our customers which leads them to postpone fairly substantial projects and if they don’t see an increase in their cash flow, they are going to go on doing that and my point is that if that happens, it’s just going to accelerate the supply decline and if that occurs at the moment when demand starts to grow, the crossover could be quite valid.  I don’t comment on the IEA’s forecast. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay, so if the oil price continues to drift higher with an economic recovery gaining traction, under that scenario how do you see the outlook?
Andrew F. Gould: Then I think there will be some time in 2010, and please don’t try to tie me down to the exact day, Ole -- some time in 2010 our customers will gain sufficient confidence to start to rebuild activity. But please don’t -- I do not think that’s in 2009 and I do think that’s in function of the oil price and their cash flows as they see them going into 2010. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Just one more follow-up question on WesternGeco, you mentioned for the first time now CSEM and the TM integration with Cube -- could you talk a little bit about the scope to use this as a tool to maybe withstand some of the general margin and pricing pressures that you highlighted in seismic in general?
Andrew F. Gould: I think that the capacity to do the integration is going to lead to a higher value, multi-client product and therefore a better priced multi-client product. That’s the scope I see for it at the moment, Ole. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Andrew, getting back to the roadmap, if you will, for non-North American margins, recognizing that 2010 is certainly opaque and there’s enough uncertainty with regard to the remainder of 2009 but quarter on quarter, you are down about 170 basis points internationally. By year-end, what do you expect within a range, the margin contraction to be into non-NAM realm? And to sort of frame it for you, Andrew, just very quickly, one of your peers suggested that international margins would be down 300 to 500 basis points within the next two to four quarters and I’m just curious as to whether you ascribe to that view. 
Andrew F. Gould: I don’t think that’s an unreasonable position to take. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Okay. 
Andrew F. Gould: I don’t know whether they will go that far but that really is going to depend a great deal on what -- if you say two to four quarters, it’s really going to depend a great deal on what activity looks like in the back-end of that. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Right. Because if I recall correctly here, the first quarter, your prophecy for non-North American margins was a typical eastern hemisphere correction, if you will, 18 months taking to unfold, margins down basically 50% from the recent peak, which would imply margins somewhere in frankly the high-teens and margins to bottom either first quarter or second quarter of next year. And if you are suggesting 300 to 500 basis points from here and you are thinking that that could be on the high-end with regard to the rate of margin contraction, it sounds like you are a little bit less -- what’s the right word -- I guess pessimistic with regard to where margins are going to bottom. 
Andrew F. Gould: I think in what I know today, that’s -- for the rest of 2009, it is probably reasonable to assume I am a little less pessimistic. However, I would put this big, big rider on whether or not that we have another leg down in 2010 because activity -- because our customers’ cash flow or our customers’ consolidating, or whatever else they do, means that there is another leg down in activity in which case, I would become much more pessimistic. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Understood. Second question relates to North American margins -- I mean, clearly everybody is sort of enduring a lot of duress for reasons that we all know. You are taking a lot of costs out of the system. The North American, at least the U.S. recount is groping for a bottom; Canada, seasonal recovery. It looks like most of the pricing woes are behind us, although you are going to get some quarter on quarter flow through. Should we expect margins, assuming that activity basically is not going to take another significant leg down, that margins have essentially bottomed for you in North America?
Andrew F. Gould: I am going to be very bold and say that Canada will improve on the basis of some modest seasonal rebound and North America I don’t think will go any lower. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Pickering with Tudor Pickering Holt.
Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt: Good morning. I just want to clarify a comment that you made, Andrew, in your remarks where you talked about -- or I think Simon maybe said that Canada and the U.S. contributed equally to the correction in margins from Q1 to Q2. Is that -- does that mean they were both down the same amount in dollars or percent or I just -- it would make a very big decline in Canada if it was the same dollar amount. 
Simon Ayat: No, it’s in the percentage term, Dan. If you take the drop that we experienced from Q1 to Q2, the major part of it is split equally between Canada and U.S. land, yes. 
Andrew F. Gould: And in percentage terms. 
Simon Ayat: Yes. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt: Okay. Thank you. That helps. And then Andrew, last quarter I asked you about whether or not we could make more money in 2010, Schlumberger corporate entity than we did in 2009 and you said it didn’t seem logical that you would. As I look at the world today, oil prices are better, as you mentioned. North America is maybe a little bit worse. Pricing issues, there’s a lot of mix issues going on for Schlumberger. I mean, has your view changed? Is it not logical to make more money next year or is it now possible?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, an awful lot will depend what happens in North America, because we could hardly make less. And then again, it comes back to all the -- everything I said to everybody else about what is the oil price going to do towards the end of this year. I mean, there is one element of this cycle that we don’t understand yet and it’s a logical element in every cycle and that is what do our customers do when their cash flows really start getting crimped? So the hedge has run out, they need to go to the bank or cut their dividends or whatever else they need to do to fund their projects. Do they do that or do they cut their projects? And that really is going to depend on their perspective of oil prices towards the end of this year.  You know, then the next logical phase in any cycle is that they start to consolidate. And we actually haven’t seen very much of that. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt: So to be determined. 
Andrew F. Gould: To be determined -- that’s the big rider on where the oil price is in the last quarter of this year. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Kieburtz with Weeden.
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Andrew, you several times described this sort of huge uncertainty that faces us toward the end of the year as to what customers are going to do based on, in your view, what oil prices are doing at the time. How do you manage Schlumberger with that sort of uncertainty? You’ve got cost-cutting efforts going on, you’ve reduced headcount -- do you do more of that and take a chance that you don’t have enough -- if the activity picks up or do you hold on and take the risk that if it’s weaker, your profitability suffers?
Andrew F. Gould: We would I think in these circumstances, having gone where we’ve gone with the headcount, hold on. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Okay. 
Andrew F. Gould: Now, we do have a volume of skilled people who have been put on leave of absence, so I am not going to tell you how many but we could call back a considerable body of people on one month’s notice. So we have a considerable body of people who badly needed a rest, Geoff, because they’ve been working very hard for the last three years, who have gone on an intended leave of absence. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Okay, so you have kind of an option there. And does that option expire?
Andrew F. Gould: After one year, so it’s not -- it’s towards the middle of next year. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Okay, and a second question is as you reference the uncertainty about what your customers do in regard to consolidation, how do you look at the oilfield service market in terms of current conditions and consolidation or M&A opportunities?
Andrew F. Gould: I think if North America remains sort of bumping along the bottom for the next six months, then you will see some consolidation in the industry. I’m not saying it’s going to be us -- I’m just saying that I think the bumping along the bottom for the next couple of quarters will tire -- wear some people out. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Could it conceivably be Schlumberger?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, we are always open for a good opportunity but the opportunity has to be real and material and I’m not sure that we are going to see that because as you know, what we can buy is quite limited. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: Okay. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Urban with Deutsche Bank.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Andrew, I would generally agree with your comment that I wouldn’t expect your customers to reopen ’09 budgets based on where we are today but I am a little surprised that maybe some projects that had been budgeted but delayed aren’t potentially moving forward or delayed maintenance or deferred maintenance not moving forward, because those are pretty short lead times and high impact activities with the oil price, where it is. I was wondering if you could comment on that a little bit. 
Andrew F. Gould: I think if you’re talking about [work over], I think that’s quite -- work over projects, production enhancement, enhanced maintenance, all the rest of it -- absolutely. They may loosen up a few more dollars. I was talking about a net increase in the number of projects. I don’t think you are going to see any major projects sanctioned until there’s a much greater confidence, degree of confidence over the stability in the oil price.  I mean, it’s bounced around by a considerable amount already this year. It’s been up, down, now it’s up again. They are going to want to see some boundaries on it before they commit. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Okay, but some of the marginal stuff is kind of -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Okay. All right, great. And then the follow-up with the -- obviously the international markets aren’t necessarily monolithic and you’ve talked about Russia increasing a little bit, so if you are talking about still a net decline on the major project side, I mean, what’s going to be a little better or a little worse over the balance of the year?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that if the oil price holds up where it is, there will be -- the North Sea will be a little bit better than we thought but that’s from it being way down. Then I think that certain parts of Southeast Asia may be a bit better than we thought. I don’t think it’s -- it may be a little -- it my help North Africa a little bit, particularly Algeria. It may help even parts of South America a bit. But this is -- yes, it’s nice to have but it’s not going to move the needle in the industry if people spend a little more money on work over. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: I was referring to your comment about continued declines in activity level. Some of those things are -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Continued decline?
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Yeah, than what’s worse -- those things are a little better. 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, what is worse is if in some of the very big projects, some of the partners say we don’t want to do the next phase and all the other partners say if you’re not going to do it, we’re not going to do it either. And we haven’t seen a lot of that yet but I have heard some of our customers say if X doesn’t follow, we won’t follow either. So this is where I talk -- this is where I start to talk about strain on the cash flow. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Boyd with Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: Andrew, when we look at the breakdown of international margin pressure going forward, I would assume that some areas such as land may have felt the impact of lower pricing sooner, just because it’s shorter cycle, whereas price concessions on longer term projects such as deep water may have not actually flowed through results yet, as you pointed out, that’s still to come. Can you comment on what you are seeing here and how that might impact geo markets?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think actually you need to segregate it more by customer than by type of project because the IOCs have been very quick to react and quick to implement price negotiations, whether it be off-shore activity or land activity. So it’s more, if you like, where you have strong concentrations of IOC activity that we -- that the price concessions have been greatest than by any particular type of activity. That’s why, for example, you take somewhere like the U.K. sector of the North Sea or West and Southern Africa, which is largely dominated by large companies, that the pricing pressure is a lot greater. 
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that’s helpful. And then as an unrelated follow-up, when we look at North America, can you comment on your ability to remove capacity from the market outside of just pressure pumping? And do you see that as an opportunity?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I mean, we do relocate assets in the other segments, so [drilling] measurements in wireline, a lot of the assets that are in North America are going to fill CapEx requirements in overseas geomarkets and therefore reducing the CapEx that we use overseas.  It’s a lot more difficult with prime movers, so it’s a lot more difficult to more trucks around the world, for example, than it is to move tools. Partly for regulatory reasons and partly because it’s just a lot more expensive, so you might park it. 
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Crandell with Barclays Capital.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital: Andrew, could you give me your current views on Iraq, how quickly you think that activity could ramp up with both the NOCs and the IOCs, and then do you think this business could be a $1 billion business for you in the next year or two? So I think that -- firstly, what are we doing in Iraq. We are currently constructing a base in the southern oilfields on speculation. We don’t have contracts to justify that base. On the basis that when activity does come back in serious amounts, that’s the best physical location to be in.  We are, as our competitors have remarked, talking to everybody. The security conditions under which we are operating are still really at the margin of what we could do safely. We probably on a well site visit will have as many security people as we do people doing operations. And I think that the likelihood is that the first activity we will see is going to be with the Iraqi national oil companies over fields. And I think it’s likely to really only make a difference next year and I think the chances of being at a $1 billion business in two years is zero. 
James Crandell - Barclays Capital: Really? Okay, a follow-up question relates to North American results here in the first quarter, and I guess it struck me that due to your stronger competitive position in deep water and in Alaska that break-even results must be viewed as disappointing to you, and was this in large part because the pricing deteriorated in some of your core businesses a lot more than what you would have thought?
Andrew F. Gould: I think that actually the shelf, the Gulf of Mexico was quite disappointing because of the reduction in shelf activity. I think that we were disappointed with U.S. land. It is largely a matter of pricing and it is across most of the segment. But we are -- we were badly hurt in Canada too, by both activity and pricing. 
James Crandell - Barclays Capital: How did pricing trend -- how was pricing, Andrew, versus your expectations in businesses such as wireline and MWD directional?
Andrew F. Gould: I don’t -- I think wireline, everyone was a bit surprised by the amount that wireline pricing declined but then the decline in activity in [Caste Hole] was so great that we shouldn’t really have been that surprised. And in drilling and measurements, I don’t think there was -- I don’t think that the pressure was nearly as bad as it was in the other segment. 
James Crandell - Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Sanchez with Howard Weil Incorporated.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated :  I just wanted to follow back up and I think you touched on it but just to be clear, you mentioned about the pricing renegotiations that took place in the first half, impacting your second half international results. I’m just curious today, are we at a point in some markets where that has completely abated as it relates to renegotiating existing term contracts or has it just moderated in certain areas? Are there still areas where it’s just as strong today as it was say three or six months ago?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that unless there’s another leg down, we finished -- pretty much finished the price renegotiations with all our major IOC customers. But a lot of those negotiations are only finished during the second quarter, so the pricing effect is going to be seen in the third and fourth quarter.  And that I think largely, those renegotiations are done. The rest of it will I think will be the rollover of tenders, which as you know takes much longer to work through the system, which is why I’ve always said that I think there’s no reason why this cycle would be particularly different from any other cycle and the full effect will take 18 months to work itself through the system.  But for the major customers, most of the renegotiations were done in the first half here. 
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated :  I guess one follow-up -- you talked about your thoughts on IPM, I guess, and on the last quarter call and the balance between owning rigs and not owning rigs and successes you could have in IPM going forward, any changes there to your thoughts? I know potentially there’s another competitor, I guess, on the service side coming in on [Chinkotep] now. Just your thoughts maybe in Mexico incrementally going forward, just kind of your IPM views going forward in terms of owning rigs versus I guess using more of a managed services approach here going forward. 
Andrew F. Gould: Firstly, I don’t think there’s one answer to the thing because as the world develops, particularly in countries where the economies are becoming more sophisticated, the issue of local content is going to become greater and greater and the capacity to import particularly a piece of equipment like a right that’s available on the market is going to become more and more difficult. So generally, we will favor a managed services approach.  In terms of [Chinkotep], we have an exposure which I would not want to increase. I feel quite comfortable where we are for a number of reasons and therefore I’m not surprised -- and I’m not at all surprised to see more and more contractors trying to break into that market. 
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated :  Thank you, Andrew. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wagar Syed with Tristone.
Wagar Syed - Tristone Capital: Andrew, could you comment on the timing of Saudi gas initiatives, when do you think they could pick up rigs as they have laid off some oil rigs but on the gas side, they’ve been talking about it. When do you think that actually could materialize?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think there already has been a considerable shift of rigs, land rigs to gas exploration. That’s taken place. It took place in the first quarter on the end of last year and offshore, there is no doubt that the bulk of the rigs and any increase they do in offshore rigs is going to be focused on gas development, as they have a number of reasonably successful discoveries. So I don’t think -- I think it’s happening. I don’t think  it’s about to come.  
Wagar Syed - Tristone Capital: And in terms of revenue per rig, how does that compare in Saudi Arabia between oil well and on a gas well, how does the revenue and margins kind of change between the two?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, like anywhere else, if the gas wells tend to have more revenue per rig, not necessarily the same percent, level of profitability or return on sales, and in terms of Saudi, in terms of oil wells, it depends very much what type of oil well you are talking about. If you are talking about a 6,000 foot development well on [Gola], the revenue is not very high. If you are talking about a very complex horizontal well on [Manufir], it’s a very different point of view. So you can’t draw a general rule.  But as a general rule, the same ratio of better revenue on a gas well applies in Saudi Arabia as it does anywhere else. 
Wagar Syed - Tristone Capital: Okay, and then on [unconventional] gas outside of North America, what are you seeing in terms of activity and how do you -- when do you think it’s going to become a material business? 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that there’s no one answer. For example, you can see already that a lot of the coal bed methane work in Australia is already being tendered. If you are talking about shale gas, North America type, the cost of development overseas is going to be very different from what it is in North America. And the chief reason is because North America already has the most developed oil field service infrastructure in the world and therefore rigs, frac fleets, water carriers, all the rest -- and the availability of water for this business is something that’s very well understood, whereas that is -- with perhaps the possible exception of Germany and Austria, that is not at all the case overseas and therefore we think it will happen but we don’t think it’s something that’s going to spread everywhere very fast. If it does start reasonably quickly, we think it’s probably going to be in Eastern Europe. 
Wagar Syed - Tristone Capital: And how about the [tight] gas initiative in Saudi? Is that -- how advanced is that? 
Andrew F. Gould: Sorry, what do you mean?
Wagar Syed - Tristone Capital: Saudi Arabia was looking at drilling the [tight] gas reservoirs and has the process started -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, we have had a tight gas center of excellent in our research center in [Dahran] for over a year now, staffed largely by specialists from North America, so -- I mean, we consider that something that is thoroughly underway. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: Could you please speak to the CapEx, modestly lowering of CapEx guidance for ’09 relative to last quarter? Are we looking at cost savings or have you made some adjustments to the CapEx program?
Andrew F. Gould: I think we are largely looking at back-filling with transfers from idle CapEx in other markets. And I don’t think you can talk about cost-savings yet. I do think actually that it is possible that that continues and it drifts a bit lower over the balance of the year. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: That’s helpful. That seems to make sense on the oilfield side. On the seismic side, the WesternGeco, are you deferring some of the CapEx on the new vessels?
Andrew F. Gould: No, we’re not hurrying but we are not deferring them -- we are completing them as and when it’s reasonable to do so without incurring additional cost. So we haven’t -- with the exception of certain vessels that we did not take delivery of on the leases, we are not deferring any of the CapEx on the owned vessel. 
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: And for the follow-up, or unrelated follow-up, on the M&A side, $186 million in the quarter, I think we saw a press release on [Texia] -- can you give us some information about -- I’m going to guess that that wasn’t all for [Texia]. Can you give us some information on what else you bought?
Andrew F. Gould: The rest was a couple of small technology related companies in Russia. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: Thank you. Andrew, I wanted to ask if in your comment about the postponement of projects, or delay or cancellation, do deep water drilling and development projects, are they also in that category?
Andrew F. Gould: They actually have been surprisingly resilient, so yes, we’ve seen some postponement but not cancellation. So for example, we do see a lot of contracts that will actually come into operation in deep water in the second half of 2010 and in 2011. There’s been very little actual cancellation.  Where there has been -- another movement which I think I talked about last quarter, Robin, is a shift from exploration to development on the basis that development produces cash flow. 
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: Okay, and just staying on that theme then, in your position, market share in deep water prospectively with the rigs that will be entering service over the next couple of years, how do you feel about your market share in various product lines with regard to the installed equipment and awards that may not have already been made?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I don’t know about awards that have not already been made. What I can tell you is that on awards that have been made for known, for projects that are known and have been tendered, I am very, very satisfied with the market share that we have. 
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: Okay. All right, that’s good for me. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Conner with Capital One.
Pierre Conner - Capital One: Andrew, on the premise that your answer to Dan’s earlier question about capacity in North America was excluding pressure pumping, I wanted to get your take on that, on North America pressure pumping capacity. Other players in this market have discussed retirements and would you care to talk about your plans?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I mean, we do some retirement and we are doing some mothballing, so -- and as I think my competitor described, that has a lot to do with the condition of the equipment and the cost of refurbishing it or not refurbishing it, and the fact that some of these massive frac jobs chew up equipment, as I think they put it, much faster than traditional fracs.  But today we have a mix of retirement and mothballing. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One: And my assumption is that that retirement and mothballing then has increased with the current market and a shift towards higher intensity fracking?
Andrew F. Gould: Yeah, and it’s still going on. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One: Okay, and then my unrelated follow-up actually is to do with the pricing in marine. I wanted to understand -- you know, you have a backlog and I am assuming you are executing against that backlog. Is there active renegotiation on contracts underway or -- help me understand the mechanics of that. 
Andrew F. Gould: Actually, there has been very, very little attempt on the part of our customers to renegotiate seismic contracts that are being executed. They have of course pushed them out or trying to shorten -- where they can do it, shorten the duration but actually renegotiating price, they have not really been trying to do that, probably because they have a fairly clear optic of how far they are committed. But obviously when they re-tender or when they do tender, and in fact there is quite a surprisingly high level of marine tendering going on, then they expect much lower prices. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One: Okay. 
Andrew F. Gould: So the backlog is being renewed but at a much lower price, Pierre. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One: I understand. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Thanks. So Andrew, I am going to ask you a very macro question, an opinion which maybe you’ll want to duck -- is that price that you are speaking of in and around $60 for West Texas or whatever light sweet crude which would give them a $10 cushion, or can it be somewhat lower?
Andrew F. Gould: In my opinion, it’s higher, Kevin. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Higher than 60?
Andrew F. Gould: In my opinion, it’s more like 70. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: So if we -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Because their costs have gone up, because they -- you know, borrowing costs have gone up, government tax take has gone up, 60 is okay but it’s not going to lead to a rash of new activity whereas I think 70 might be a lot more encouraging. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Okay, and then an unrelated follow-up as well -- the uptake of your value-added technologies relative to prior down cycles, it seems like you are holding up better, maybe with the Petrel platform a little more integrated into the decision-making process. And then the same with a differential edge and data acquisition. I mean, would you -- what’s your take on -- 
Andrew F. Gould: I think so probably a bit better but not much, Kevin because our customers have become extremely cost-sensitive and therefore the first thing they do is tell their engineers they are not allowed to buy the bells and whistles.  But certainly in the domain of software, Petrel, the penetration of Petrel in the market continues to be extraordinary because it brings our customers immediate efficiency. It’s not price sensitive because it brings them immediate efficiency.  But under more traditional services, I would say this is pretty much like any other cycle. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Okay, so a little better on some of the incremental software. But okay, thank you very much. That’s it for me. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Guilome Delabe] with Société Générale.
Guilome Delabe - Société Générale: I think my questions have already been answered, so no need to ask it. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert MacKenzie with FBR Capital Markets. 
Robert MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Thank you. Andrew, I have a question you may not want to answer, given the sensitivities but I’ll ask it anyways -- there’s been a lot of talk in Washington, the D.C. area here around potentially increasing regulation on hydraulic fracturing, still very unknown what the outcome is but can you give us a handicap as to where you see that issue going and the potential effects, i.e. potentially even positive or negative, positive potentially for wireline and other analysis tools and negative obviously on pressure pumping. 
Andrew F. Gould: I think that obviously the situation with natural gas in the United States is such that having discovered or unlocked this enormous, huge resource, there’s going to have to be a solution to be found. Now, whether the solution will be positive or negative I don’t know because the one thing you can be sure of is it’s going to increase the cost.  To the extent that the solution goes through some form of reporting and monitoring and all the rest of it, I am pretty sure that it will get pushed off onto the service industry. But whether or not we will be able to charge for it I think is going to depend on market fundamentals.  But common sense normally prevails and unlocking this resource is a huge positive for the United States’ domestic energy balance and therefore I am sure that some form of solution will be reached. 
Robert MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay, thanks. That’s all I had left. 
Operator: Thank you very much and that does conclude our question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would like to turn the call back over to Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir.

Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger’s earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Chairman and CEO Mr. Andrew Gould; Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Simon Ayat; and Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Mr. Theobald, please go ahead.
Malcolm Theobald :  Thank you Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2009 results conference call. Today’s call is being hosted from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place yesterday.  Before we begin with the prepared remarks, I’d like to remind the participants that some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. Joining me for today’s call from Saudi Arabia are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew’s overview of the first quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter’s financial results. After the prepared statements we will welcome your statements. And now I’ll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat:  Thank you Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter income from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $0.78 per share, down $0.25 sequentially and down $0.28 compared to the same quarter of last year. We are continuing to focus on managing our cost base. In this regard we have largely completed the headcount reduction we announced last quarter. In order to better match our costs to the lowered activity and pricing levels, we will likely have a further similar reduction over the coming months. Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services first quarter revenue fell by 13% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue dropped 8%. Oilfield Services generated $1.3 billion in pretax operating income, down $344 million sequentially with margins declining by 248 basis points to 23.1%.  By area, Oilfield Services sequential pretax operating margins highlights were as follows. North America declined by 858 basis points to 13.7%, primarily due to the impact of the rapid and deep reduction in U.S. land and U.S. Gulf of Mexico shelf activity coupled with heavy pricing pressure. Latin America improved by 168 basis points to 19.7% due to project efficiency gains on IPM projects in Mexico/Central America and a favorable mix of higher margin exploration activity offshore Brazil. These increases were partially offset by reduced gain share from an IPM project in Peru/ Colombia/Ecuador and the impact of reduced activity in Venezuela/Trinidad and Tobago. Europe/CIS/Africa was essentially flat at 25.9%. Higher margin activity in the North Sea and in Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea largely offset the combined impact of lower activity in North Africa, the less favorable revenue mix in west and South Africa, and reduced sales at [from]. Finally, Middle East/Asia was also steady at 33.1% as the more favorable revenue mix in several geo-markets offset the impact of lower activity overall in the area. At WesternGeco pretax income of $55 million reflected a decline in pretax margins of 483 basis points to 9.9%. This decrease was due to the sharp decline in market client revenue primarily in North America as customers continued to reduce their discretionary spending. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate of 21.1% was in line with last quarter after adjusting for the Q4 charges. The ETR for all of 2009 is still expected to be in the low 20s. Net debt was $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter as compared to $1.1 billion at the end of Q4. This increase is largely seasonal as we typically experience stronger Q4 tax collections on our receivables and we pay profit sharing and other related benefits in Q1. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $2.1 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remained unused and were available at the end of March. This compares to short term debt of only $1.6 billion, reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet and leaving us with more than enough liquidity to meet all corporate and operational requirements. In addition, during the quarter we established $3 billion near to medium term [north] program which provide for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in euro or U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies.  In March we issued 1 billion euro of 4.5% notes due 2014 under this program. The issuance of these notes was extremely well received. The proceeds from these notes will be used to refinance existing debt obligations and for general corporate purposes and will even further increase Schlumberger’s financial flexibility. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $273 million of pension funding and $748 million of CapEx. Given the current economic environment we have temporarily suspended our stock buyback activity. Oilfield Services CapEx is expected to approach $2 billion in 2009, while WesternGeco is expected to reach $600 million which includes $270 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels. And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould:  Thank you Simon and good morning or good afternoon everybody. Schlumberger first quarter revenue declined sequentially as activity continued to weaken around the globe in response to reduced customer spending as the global economic recession reduced demand for both oil and natural gas. The rate of decline in Oilfield Services accelerated considerably compared to the fourth quarter, largely due to the precipitous drop in North American natural gas recount. Outside North America, low activity in Russia and the fall of many foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar remained the principal causes of weakness. Looking at the areas in more detail and starting with North America, the U.S. land geo-market recorded a significant decrease in sequential revenue as low natural gas prices and a lack of available credit for some customers resulted in a rapid and deep reduction in activity that was coupled with heavy pricing pressure. Offshore, revenue in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico geo-market fell through weak shelf drilling activity and associated pricing erosion, although expected deepwater projects began operations much as expected. In Canada revenue fell as winter drilling activity was unusually low and the spring break-up came unusually early. These decreases however partially offset by high seasonal expiration related activity in Alaska. In Latin America, the Venezuela/ Trinidad and Tobago geo-markets saw the sharpest sequential revenue decrease as a result of lower activity and related demand for drilling and measurements, well services and wireline technologies, coupled with reduced IPM activity. In Peru, Colombia, Ecuador revenue fell following the year-end sales in the prior quarter of SIS software and [offshore] lift products while the Argentina/Bolivia/Chile geo-market decreased on lower activity related demand for wireline drilling and measurements and well services. Area revenue was also reduced by 2% due to the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar. These decreases however were partially offset by increased revenue into the Mexico/Central America geo-market due to efficiency gains on IPM projects and in the Brazil geo-market as a result of robust demand for high technology, drilling and measurements and wireline services on offshore operations where IOC activity grew as originally scheduled. Within Europe/Africa/CIS, the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Russia and the North Sea, reduced area revenue by 5%. In addition, Russia experienced a sharp drop in revenue as a result of seasonal weather related slowdowns, further reductions in customer activity and heavy pricing pressure. Revenue for the North Africa geo-market was down due to lower demand for well services technologies and software products, while the Caspian geo-market experienced reduced demand for well services, drilling and measurements and wireline as customer activity slowed. Weaker formal revenue also contributed to the sequential decline in the area. These decreases were partially offset by improved activity in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea that resulted in increased demand for wireline services.  Lastly, in the Middle East and Asia area sequential revenue fell primarily due to reduced customer activity in the Arabian/Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, Thailand/Vietnam and East Mediterranean geo-markets, in addition to seasonal weather related slowdowns in China/Japan/Korea geo-market. These declines in activity mainly affected demand for well testing, wireline and drilling and measurement services. At WesternGeco the rate of sequential revenue decline slowed to 8% as continued weakness in North America multi-client revenue was partially offset by improved marine, with the start of several new proprietary contracts. Data processing also reported a sequential decrease across all areas except Latin America, while LAN was down due to completion of projects in the Middle East. Overall backlog decreased by $319 million to $1.5 billion, partly due to delayed contract awards pending the results of licensing runs in several countries. Looking at Schlumberger as a whole we have already taken actions to right size our operations without diminishing our capacity to react to market changes. Our operating cost base has declined sequentially by more than $450 million due to prompt action over all variable cost categories until the effects of favorable exchange rate movements. Recent economic forecasts have yet to show any positive trends in GDP stabilization or growth, with the major forecasting agencies lowering their demand expectations accordingly.  Our visibility on 2009 has therefore not materially changed from the end of the fourth quarter. We do not see any significant recovery in North America gas drilling before 2010. Overseas, while activity declines will be limited, customers are actively seeking and are obtaining price relief to improve the economics of current projects. At the same time, exploration expenditures are being deferred in favor of projects that produce immediate cash flow. We are encouraged to see offshore deepwater activity resisting fairly well to the current budget cuts.  As we indicated on our fourth quarter comments longer term we remain convinced that any demand recovery for oil will need to be accompanied by increased investment to offset decline in the aging production base. 
Malcolm Theobald :   Okay Greg. Thank you Andrew. We will now turn the call over for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  I guess maybe I’ll start with just the general commentary, deepwater as you said is sort of the one thing that still looks good. Do you see any green shoots anywhere other than deepwater? We’re definitely decelerating but any signs of growth anywhere?
Andrew Gould : Are you talking about the oil and gas business, Michael, or?
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  Yes. Well, I’m just talking about your business. I mean, Saudi Gas, you know there’ve been sort of pockets of growth. Algeria. Can you talk about? Because your overall tone just sort of seems to be that the market as a whole is decelerating still, you know, this is a market that’s contracting and I’m just trying to sort of see where the signs of recovery and life might be.
Andrew Gould : Well, there are always pockets that are different and you know, but if you ask for a global judgment yes, it’s still decelerating. And you know the – as we all know the overseas cycle takes 12 to 18 months to work itself out which is why I commented that I don’t have a great deal of clearer vision than I had at the beginning of the year.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  Okay.
Andrew Gould:
 : So you know yes, there are always pockets of resistance. There’s gas in the Middle East, there’s Brazil, there’s Australia, there are little pockets of resistance all around the globe. But I think the pockets of resistance today are more linked to the commitment to long term projects that customers have taken which is more expensive for them to stop or slow than to continue.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  And are those pockets of resistance feeling pressure from the general slowdown in terms of pricing and competitiveness on those contracts, etc.?
Andrew Gould:   Well I think that on large projects where not only the operator but also the service company has a considerable investment and in conducting smooth operations the tendency is for the operators want to re-negotiate price rather than re-tender and disturb the whole operation. So yes. Are all the majors and large independents and some of the NOCs aggressive on asking the service industry to reduce price? Absolutely. And as I said in my commentary it is better for all parties to negotiate rather than to run to re-tender.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  And then lastly on the deepwater side if I guess there was some uncertainty in past calls about what the gross versus net rig additions would be. Do you have any thoughts there in terms of capital allocation, pulling equipment from idle rigs and putting them on the new rigs or I guess I’m generally referencing the CapEx down 10% in the company to deepwater.
Andrew Gould:   Sure. There is a lot of CapEx associated with deepwater that you cannot pull from other rigs. So for example the cables, the [capstons] that are used in deepwater, they’re unique to deepwater and some of the units are unique to deepwater. But to the extent that we can pull tools from other theaters where activity is declining and put them on deepwater rigs absolutely we’re doing that. As far as the CapEx, you know, I wouldn’t say the whole amount but some of the CapEx savings will be due to rationalization across different parts of the world.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  I was wondering if you might be able to give us some range of magnitude of the pricing relief that your customers are asking for in the international markets and just in context could you also give us some general sense on what product lines are most vulnerable and which may be least vulnerable?
Andrew Gould:   Well I think the best way I can say this because I don’t want to give you a number is that it is much less than some of our dear customers are announcing. Some of the announcements they’ve made as objectives they are not achieving in terms of price reduction from the service industry. I would say that anything to do with deepwater probably has the most capacity to resist. Anything to do with bulk land markets has the least capacity to resist. And jack ups would be somewhere in between.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  And service lines related to working with jack ups, is that what you mean?
Andrew Gould:   Well, I’m saying all service lines. I’m not going to distinguish between one service line or another because the pressure is fairly general. What I’m going to distinguish is type of activity. So I’m saying that in deepwater there is more capacity to resist. On land, you know, big bulk land operations, lots of land rigs, lots of competition, there’s much less capacity to resist. And jack ups and third generation semis would come somewhere in between.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  My follow up would be that you had a phenomenal performance in Europe, Russia and Africa in the quarter and I was curious as to how much of that was related to activity or business vis-a-vie how much of that can be contributed to the cost cutting efforts that you already referenced?
Andrew Gould:   I think in activity I think that the serious decline was obviously Russia. The rest held up probably slightly better than even we expected, particularly the North Sea in West Africa. And the capacity to offset Russia largely came through pretty prompt action in last quarter of last year on cost reduction.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  So a mix of all?
Andrew Gould:   Yes, mix was good and the cost reduction efforts took place early.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  And I just want to clarify one last thing, when the comments were made on cost cutting, the cost reductions that we saw $450 million in the quarter, did I hear you guys right in saying you expect to see a similar impact as we move into the second quarter?
Andrew Gould:   I’m going to let Simon answer that Kurt.
Simon Ayat:  So Kurt basically the $450 represent mostly valuable costs. There is a lot of cost associated with the revenue drop that you know naturally disappears, like cost of product. We had some favorable exchange gains but this has not much impact on the bottom line because a similar amount also was dropped in the revenue. So what we’ve got to see going forward is the impact on the reduction in headcount that as I mentioned, it’s almost completed, the first wave that we announced. So you will see a cost reduction although it will be from a different nature than the one that you have – we have already seen in the first quarter. This is mostly valuable element and the fixed costs will take a little bit longer to adjust to.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on your views with respect to a global oil supply response to this very steep slowdown that we have seen in global activity, something you talked about before? And I think if anything this slowdown seems to have been steeper than anybody could have imagined. Or maybe not. But give us some clarification on what you see there and how you see it relative to what you saw half a year ago?
Andrew Gould:   Well actually I’m still very much in the mood I was at Howard Wheel, Ole. That is that we need to see a stabilization of demand before the supply decline is really going to bite. And it’s the timing of – to me it’s more the timing of the stabilization of demand and even if there’s a slight increase in demand that is going to tip the scales rather than the decline in supply. Now obviously if the decline in supply goes on long enough, beyond the rest of this year and all the rest of it, that’s going to start having a material impact. But we really, really need to see the stabilization of demand I think to get to the situation where it’s likely to tip.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  With the GDP remissions having sort of started to turn positively again, at least not the same freefall that they’ve been through over the past six months should be –
Andrew Gould:   I think that the oil industry as a whole service providers and our customers will be making a judgment in the third quarter. And that judgment will be very material to what our activity is likely to be in 2010 and that judgment will be made on the basis of how they see GDP progression at that point in time and what the oil price is at that point in time.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  So with that Andrew, any positions in any major markets where you’re concerned about Schlumberger’s safe and also elaborate a little bit on a lot of technologies mentioned again in your press release, whether there are any new trends and what these things could mean relative to the volume you see in business, the mix and the world pricing trends? I mean, how is this all going to shape out? 
Andrew Gould:   You know, there are always out of the 30 odd geo-markets there are always one or two that we’re worrying about, but not – none of them are really something that we – you know, we worry but not in any way losing sleep over it. In terms of technologies I said before that we have divided our portfolio into three. There is first the technology to match competitive threat that we will introduce as and when it is ready. Secondly there is technology to reduce customer costs which we will introduce when it’s ready. And thirdly there is some technology that we consider this is not the right market to introduce it in, because you will be introducing it at a lower level of pricing and therefore we will take the time to perfect that and bring it back to the market when we see activity starting to increase again.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Alan Laws - BAS-ML.
Alan Laws - BAS-ML:  Your margins were better than your peers. You attribute a lot of the margin preservation to mix. I was wondering how much has to do with the established footprint in market share position? Essentially are you kind of the last to feel any pain in most of the markets other than maybe North America?
Andrew Gould:   Actually given our size I think we’re the first to be attacked. So I don’t think you can attribute to that. It is true that our footprint helps in these circumstance, but I am afraid I have to compliment the management team. We made the decision that we’re going to have to cut costs in October last year and they have done an excellent job.
Alan Laws - BAS-ML:  Do you still see this as a typical cycle and do you think that the pace of margin compression with your backdrop that you laid out there is going to be smooth? Or do you think it’s going to be choppy?
Andrew Gould:   Actually I don’t have any reason today not to think that this is not like any other eastern hemisphere cycle. So let’s leave aside North America. Eastern hemisphere cycles typically take about 18 months to roll over, and if you consider that this cycle started in Q4 of last year, then if it follows the pattern of all the previous cycles it will rollover in Q2 of next year. Now there are always factors that can influence that one way or the other, positively or negatively. You know negatively would be that the recession deepens, positively would be what Ole just mentioned that supply starts to rollover sooner than you think. But I don’t have – we don’t have, in fact I was discussing this with Chakib just before we came on the call, we don’t have any reason to believe this is not going to be a normal cycle.
Alan Laws - BAS-ML:  On the deepwater side a follow up because of the impact of the Brazilian expirations seem to have on your related mix and on your results. With the general shift away from exploration that you’ve mentioned in the last few releases, can you comment on the decline in your kind of revenue or your profitability expectations versus what you may have been anticipating last fall? I guess what I’m really trying to get at it here is what the incremental expiration means for Schlumberger in a normal market if –
Andrew Gould:   That’s a good question, Alan, and I think that obviously I don’t have to describe the effect on seismic to you. It’s dramatic. And in terms of the other high end measurement services that we perform, principally well and testing, obviously any reduction in exploration is unfavorable to their revenue mix. But it’s not dramatic at the level of the company. It makes our margin performance more difficult and it’s generally unfavorable.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.:  Andrew, several people have commented margins in eastern hemisphere held up extraordinarily well, but your kind of outlook comment emphasized the degree to which customers are getting price relief. I’m just having a little difficulty reconciling the strength of the margins and this comment that customers are getting price relief. Is there something about the first quarter that held up margins better than you would expect to be sustained? Or is this just a timing issue?
Andrew Gould:   I think timing issue is a good way to describe it, Geoff. We started cutting costs in Q4. The customers started negotiating with us in Q1 and therefore a lot of the price concessions that we have given will flow through in the subsequent quarters.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.:  And given that you had a sounds like one quarter head start on the cost cutting side, how do you feel about your chances of being able to preserve these margins as the pricing rolls in but then the cost benefits also are being realized?
Andrew Gould:   I think that to repeat Q1s performance will be extremely difficult.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.:  And just on the cost cutting side, Simon made a comment about the second quarter and I wasn’t quite sure I got it correctly. Is there another round of headcount reductions planned for the –
Andrew Gould:   Yes, I mentioned it at Howard Wheel but basically we said that we think over the coming months there will be an equivalent to the initial number which was 5,000 which will take place. But this will be much less noticeable because it will be spread all over the world. In other words, the first one was very much North America and the second one will still be North America but a lot of it will be spread around the world, so it won’t be noticeable – quite so noticeable if you like.
Operator:  Your next question comes from James Crandell - Barclays Capital.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  What would be your best guess as to when you would see the bottom in eastern hemisphere revenues and margins by quarter?
Andrew Gould:   Well I think that assuming the economy stages some form of recovery towards the end of this year, then this will be as I mentioned earlier a classic cycle that is likely to be in the first half of next year.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  From both revenues and margins?
Andrew Gould:   As soon as revenues pick up if our cost base has been cut the way we think it’s been cut, then the first few quarters it will flow through nicely.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  Can you talk to the overall profit outlook for WesternGeco from here?
Andrew Gould:   Well I said in Q1 that they would be profitable and they will have positive cash flow. I don’t think I can change my outlook, Jim. The huge uncertainty as always is going to be multi-client in the second half of the year and we really – we have quite a good feel for overseas multi-client but North America multi-client is going to be an unknown until the last minute.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  Do you think that the world is moving increasingly on land toward an IPM model and do you think having a fleet of land rigs is going to be essential toward being the leading participant in that market?
Andrew Gould:   Well you know I think over time that package drilling is going to become far more common all around the world. And I’m deliberately saying package drilling and not IPM. And the issue with land rigs is they’re very nice when the market is strong and they’re awful when the market is weak. So I don’t – we still don’t think that it is in all cases essential to own land rigs to participate in package drilling projects.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  But you do expect the package drilling projects will continue to grow as a percentage of all the land business outside of North America?
Andrew Gould:   Over time. If you look at the well density per square kilometer or square mile or whatever you want in North America and you compare it to overseas and you say that the U.S. industry is 40 years ahead of the rest, over time if you want to recover oil you have to drill. So you know there’s going to be more holes drilled and therefore yes I do.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt:  I guess Simon could you talk a little bit about the working capital draw in the quarter? Pretty big number. Is that just Q4 good collections getting some of that in Q1 or is there something else going on there? And what should we expect for the rest of the year in working capital?
Simon Ayat:  Well normally Q1 we do deteriorate in working capital as comparing to Q4. And in Q4 we have as we do every year good collections. There are certain customers that pay their cash allocations. And if you look back at Q4 we performed extremely well on receivables which reversed the situation in the Q1. The other item is the payment of the incentive bonuses and the profit sharing that takes place in Q1. So if you add these two it’s almost 70 to 80% of the deterioration in working capital. So we did expect it to be at this level as a matter of fact.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt:  So it was in line with your expectations?
Simon Ayat:  Yes.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Then I guess Andrew as we look at Schlumberger in its entirety as you look through the rest of the year, international margins outperformed our estimate this quarter, North America in line, you’ve got all sorts of mix and pricing issues going on. Kind of how do you think about the magnitude of margin compression for Schlumberger as a whole as we move through 2009? I mean, are we going to be able to hold margins steady?
Andrew Gould:   I don’t think overseas we’re going to be. North America I just don’t know. And overseas I don’t – we had a timing where we cut costs before we renegotiated price so I don’t think we can hold Q1 margins through the rest of the year.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt:  So the decrimentals that you’ve talked about generally in the international market, you haven’t really changed your expectation there it’s just the timing is a little different?
Andrew Gould:   No. It’s just the timing, yes.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt:  Last thing related to that I guess would simply be given what you’ve said it sounds like North America doesn’t get better until 2010, international is mid-2010. Can Schlumberger make more money in 2010 than 2009?
Andrew Gould:   You know I haven’t even thought about that. It’s too early to tell, Dan. It’s too early to tell. It doesn’t seem logical, so it really depends on the strength of the economic recovery.
Operator:  Your next question comes from William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  Andrew, forging ahead here with regard to international margins again, recognizing again that you have prophecy to your that pricing concessions are going to roll through the income statement and margins are going to decline, assuming a relatively stagnant drilling environment in which international as a whole isn’t going down significantly and you do witness some kind of stabilization if you will by mid-point of next year, do we witness a similar margin path internationally that we witnessed in the late ‘90s? In terms of magnitude?
Andrew Gould:  In terms of the magnitude of the decline? I really don’t know, Bill. I haven’t thought about that a lot. I’m trying to think –
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  For example, we went from 20% to 10% I think, assuming my model’s right.
Andrew Gould:   I’m going to be uncharacteristically optimistic here and say that given the importance of offshore, given a broader, much broader presence than at that time particularly in Russia, and given the service mix we have today I would be amazed if it went that low.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  How about degree in terms of rate of change?
Andrew Gould:   Oh, I don’t think the rate of change will vastly vary from previous cycles. You guys are almost done, right? And they then we’re talking about national oil company tenders rolling over which takes 12 to 18 months.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  We lost money in WesternGeco in 2003. Do you foresee being able to make money at WesternGeco through this adjustment period? And if you do envision making money during the entirety of this adjustment period, what adjustments are you making in order to do that?
Andrew Gould:   So let me deal with the last part first, okay? So we are cutting costs in WesternGeco, particularly variable costs around the vessels and the land crews proactively and we actually will lay off some vessels. Not very many but we will lay some off. So what are the differences between now and 2003? The first is 2003 was still quite shortly after we had merged Western Geophysical with Geco Factor and at the height of that we had 28 boats and we gradually worked up those boats so we were much more exposed then than we are now in the marine market. The second thing is and this is going to be a question for the whole seismic industry, not just for WesternGeco.  In 2000 and that period, everybody went out and shopped multi-client or speculative seismic on the basis of being able to borrow from the banks. Now hopefully this time around the banks will have the good sense not to lend everybody the money to go and choose a lot of speculative seismic which will encourage a must faster reduction of the marine fleet than we had in that cycle, Bill. The other thing is we had inherited a huge combined library from Western Geophysical and Geco factor and today our library is tiny. The balance sheet value is $285 million whereas I think, Simon, it was well over $1 billion, no?
Simon Ayat:  Close to $1 billion, yes.
Andrew Gould:   Close to $1 billion last time around. But we are very hopeful that we will be able to make money through the cycle.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  Given the strength of your balance sheet and given your past sort of proclamations that were prices to contract by a sufficient magnitude that you would be more opportunistic from an M&A standpoint, how savory is the environment now with regard to acquisitions? Are seller expectations reasonable or is the environment pretty sort of inflexible and you’re not optimistic about doing something?
Andrew Gould:   There are certain markets where we have made acquisitions in the past. For example Russia, the state of credit markets is making aspirations much more reasonable than they were even a couple of months ago. I think it will take time to work through the system and other places. For example, North America I suspect it’s going to take another quarter or so before people really realize, feel a little choked. So I would say expectations are adapting themselves, they’re not all there yet.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities:  In the Russia specifically market that has hurt you of late, there’s some view that that market is at least bottoming out. One, would you agree with that? And two, if so is it going to stay at low levels for some period of time or is there any hope of a recovery there and relatively near term?
Andrew Gould:   I would agree that the Russian oil companies because of the devaluation of the ruble against the dollar have made huge ruble profits and will over the next few months. I also think that the decline in Russian production is now becoming a recognized fact. And without being in any way certain because there are a lot of uncertainties still to be resolved, it is not impossible that towards the end of the year we see some mild recovery in western Siberian activity. Even this year there is a lot of seasonal related effect in the first quarter Russia revenue. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities:  I’ve kind of been polling folks on this one, so sort of interested in your view. Does the level of the oil price matter so much as the stability? So at $50 oil in 2008 costs maybe not but with costs coming down the way they are and if you have even stability at these levels does that change the outlook of your customers just more from a confidence standpoint?
Andrew Gould:   Well obviously yes it does change the confidence of the customers, but I still think that given the nature of many of the projects that our customers want to undertake, even with the cost reductions, $50 oil is going to be tough.
Operator:  Your next question comes from William Sanchez - Howard Weil Inc.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Inc.:  Andrew, just a follow up question on the pricing concessions. This is strictly something that you’re only offering or giving up on the traditional delivery of your services or are you seeing your clients wanting price relief on the existing IPM contracts you signed even though those are turnkey in nature?
Andrew Gould:   I don’t think we have seen any requests for price relief on an IPM project, Bill. My colleagues are confirming that to me. We have not.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Intl.:  Is there an expectation for that here as we move through the year or no?
Andrew Gould:   No. I think that however the scope of the amount of IPM work that’s going to be available could well be affected by budget cuts in some of the customers who use IPM.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Inc.:  One follow up as relates to Latin America. I guess another quarter really no start up costs impacting margins. Just curious as we move through ’09 and the incremental Chicontepec award gets started, do we expect to see some margin pressures as a result of start ups or we pretty much are entrenched there and shouldn’t expect anything detrimental to margins?
Andrew Gould:   I think our footprint in Chicontepec now is sufficiently mature that we can start the next APG without any significant start up costs. There may be some usual mobilization of rigs, that sort of thing, but apart from that no.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Brad Handler - Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  Can we come back to WesternGeco please and would you help us with I guess a little bit more some quarterly outlook. So for example first question, if there is typically some seasonal weakness in the second quarter as boats transit north is that something that we can expect to see again this year?
Andrew Gould:   Yes. I think so. Yes. I’m not quite sure it will have such a dramatic effect as it did last year but we’ll certainly see it again.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  But there’s boats in transit for some summer work in the North Sea and that’s –
Andrew Gould:   Yes and you know one of the things which I said before I’ll repeat it not because it’s useful for everyone to know is during the time that the fleet was flat out, we postponed dry docking boats which the classification societies will let you do for a certain period of time. But however now that we’re in a different market, we are going to do the dry docks that are required for the certification of the boats. So it is transit and dry docking.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  Last quarter you mentioned $1 billion in backlog in WesternGeco expected to work off in ’09. 
Andrew Gould:   $1.8 billion.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  I think that was total, and I was looking back and it was $1 billion that you thought would be worked off in ’09, right?
Andrew Gould:   Probably yes. Sorry, total backlog was $1.8 billion.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  So is there any change to that $1 billion?
Andrew Gould:   No. Not really. I mean there are parts of the part that were eaten up in Q1.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  Right. But there’s no delays of projects per se?
Andrew Gould:   No. We haven’t seen – we have some pressure but we’ve not yet seen any radical cancellations or requests for major price relief. What we are seeing is our customers are pushing surveys out. In other words the backlog may last longer than we originally thought.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  So into – but the 2010, the remainder of that backlog might stretch out even longer?
Andrew Gould:   It might stretch out a bit yes.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  You mentioned a commercial project for Coil shooting which sounds interesting and we’re aware of that technology a bit, I guess it’s interesting you mentioned three technology categories and this one might have been considered in that third one where pricing would not have – you might have waited to a different market? Just to take advantage of the tightness in boats because you’re actually loosening up supply effectively, right? So it’s an observation but if there’s any color you’d give us in coil shooting –
Andrew Gould:   What I have to give you is that we had already performed extensive field tests with customers of Coil shooting. It would have been perhaps very difficult for us to take it off the market now.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  Is it an unfortunate truism that you do affectively add some capacity back into the market by –
Andrew Gould:   No, because we reduced the number of boats that are required to do [y-asm] or [full-asm] of shooting yes, but we’re not giving away Coil shooting.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  Andrew, care to weigh in on Iraq and possible opportunities that may emerge over the next 6 to 12 months?
Andrew Gould:   Well I’ve been in the Middle East for the last eight days and everyone agrees that Iraq is going to happen, but nobody I’ve met can agree on the exact timing. So we will be in a state of preparedness on the basis that we think something will happen in 2010 but what’s going to happen and with whom we really don’t have a good view today Michael.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.:  If we could get back to Latin America, a lot of moving parts on the margin issues. You mentioned mix and offshore activity Brazil which should be a positive, efficiency gains I guess from rolling off the start ups on some of your IPM but then we have additional IPM start ups and so just good performance in the quarter in margins and I know that you’ve kind of addressed this a little bit but the additional IPM start ups will those tend to take margins down sequentially as you have more past due in there?
Andrew Gould:   You know the – so let me hear where the margin question on IPM. When projects are stable, margin improvement comes through performance and in Mexico that means how many wells you deliver to Permanex and Permanex accept per month. It’s a cycle, right? So Q1 we did a lot better than Q4 probably because we were doing better in [bogas]. I suspect that – and in the south by the way. I don’t as I said before I don’t anticipate large start up costs in Chicontepec and the only question in Chicontepec is going to be how quickly we can get to the same levels of efficiency as we have in the current contract.  And then in the rest of Latin America you know we have lower activity in Peru/ Colombia/ Ecuador and Venezuela/ Trinidad and Tobago; higher in Brazil; lower in Argentina. It’s a complete mix. So the dominating factors upwards in Mexico and Brazil and the dominating factors downwards were Peru/ Colombia/Ecuador and Venezuela/Trinidad and Tobago.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.:  So the mix in Brazil, the improvement in that mix, should continue and there should be continued growth in – I’m talking about even –
Andrew Gould:   Well certainly as long as IOC exploration continues the mix should continue to improve.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.:  Relative to consolidation opportunities in North America and it seems like in this up cycle we’re muted on margin expansion through competition, particularly in pressure pumping. But what is your appetite? You mentioned a couple of quarters for some people to see a choke point. So what is your appetite for consolidation for the sake of consolidation or versus for technology gains, North America specifically?
Andrew Gould:   We’ve never been – we’ve not been and I don’t think we would be doing acquisitions purely to consolidate market share. There has to be something more to it. So but you know we will as I said before be opportunistic.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.:  So even with a different complexion of the growth this time from expansion of all the players it’s still your strategy?
Andrew Gould:   Yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup:  One of the comments you made at a recent conference, one of the areas that you cited as not economic at current oil prices is ultra deepwater and I wanted to ask you what specifically – where you make that cutoff in terms of deepwater and ultra deepwater? And what kind of oil price is required to make the ultra deepwater play more economic?
Andrew Gould:   Actually I think that ultra deepwater is probably north of 8,000 foot of water or something like that, deep is 10,000. It’s really huge stuff where the rigs are very expensive. And actually I think that the oil price we need is obviously to make the project economic, but it’s also to de-risk the projects. Because obviously the risk is much higher when you’re doing that sort of work. So I think we’re going to have to get back to the $70 to see a big resurgence of things like ultra deepwater or very remote Arctic for example.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup:  You mentioned heavy oil, enhanced oil recovery, ultra deepwater not profitable at current levels. And how critical – I mean in the overall sense how critical are all of those areas to Schlumberger’s ultimate rebound from – 
Andrew Gould:   I think ultra deepwater for us would be icing on the cake. I think enhanced oil recovery was a growth business and therefore at the moment doesn’t play a big part in what we do, but could play a big part in the future. So to the extent that it restarts it will provide a growth opportunity. And heavy oil depends. If it flows we have a role to play. If it doesn’t flow naturally, then our role is somewhat reduced. So heavy oil not being I think needing prices way north of $70, particularly in Canada, it’s likely to take quite some considerable time. But it does not have a huge effect on us.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup:  And then in Russia is this another factor in this slow or recovery that you expect there is mostly that kind of activity? I’m talking about enhanced recovery, sorry.
Andrew Gould:   When I see EOR I was thinking more in terms of CO2 floods. So just the production enhancement activity in Russia we think will come back quite fast eventually.
Operator:  Your last question comes from Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs:  Andrew I’d like to just follow up really quickly on North America and with margins. I recognize there’s a lot of uncertainty out there. Could you just add some comments on the expectations for further margin declines and once the recount and activity flatten out, would you expect margins to flatten out and intentionally pick up as cost savings roll through? Or would you expect there to be a further decline at that point?
Andrew Gould:   So firstly I think that everyone is going to have a really rough time in the second quarter with North America margins just on the basis of very low activity. And actually I think that cost reduction will allow the industry, will allow us to stabilize North America margins but it’s going to take either removal of capacity or a fairly substantial increase in the rig count to move pricing power back the other way.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs:  But you would expect a bottoming of margins in Q2 or potentially 3Q and then they should be on the upward move in 4Q?
Andrew Gould:   I don’t know what’s going to happen in North America this year and I will not know and I don’t think I’ll have any idea until we see some improvement in industrial demand for gas.

Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations for Schlumberger Limited. Please go ahead sir.
Malcolm Theobald :  Thank you [Shelly]. Welcome to today’s fourth quarter and full year 2008 results conference call for Schlumberger Limited. Before we begin I’d like to review the logistics and format of today’s call.  Some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request.  And now for the call participants and format. Sitting with me for today’s call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew’s overview of the results and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the financial results. After the opening comments, we will open the call for questions. And now I’ll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat:  Thank you Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. Schlumberger’s fourth quarter income from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.03 per share, down $0.22 sequentially and down $0.08 compared to the same quarter of last year. As announced, we are taking actions to reduce our global workforce as a result of the recent decline in activity in the Oilfield Services sector. We therefore recorded an exceptional charge of $0.08 per share during the quarter primarily to reflect these actions and create a solution relating to a client with liquidity issues. Depending how the market situation evolves, further actions may be necessary. Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue fell by 2% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue dropped 33% sequentially. Oilfield Services generated $1.6 billion in pretax operating income, down $100 million sequentially with margins slipping by 117 basis points to 25.6%. By area, Oilfield Services pretax operating margin highlights were as follows. My comments are on a sequential basis. North America pretax margin improved by 115 basis points to 22.3% with a strong offshore recovery in the Gulf of Mexico after the hurricane impaired third quarter and strong activity in U.S. land west and in Alaska. These increases were partially offset by the impact of pricing pressure in the U.S. land central and U.S. land north geo-markets.  Latin America pretax margin declined 211 basis points to 18%, with lower activity levels in the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago geo-market, and unfavorable activity mix in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico central geo-market. In Europe/CIS/Africa, pretax margin reduced 295 basis points to 26.1% as Russia experienced its seasonal decline in activity offshore in Sakhalin combined with significant reductions in activity in other areas due to lower customer spendings. Less favorable revenue mix in the North Sea and Nigeria and Gulf of Kenya geo-markets also reduced area margin.  Finally, Middle East/Asia pretax margin declined 199 basis points to 33.5% on lower oil activity and less favorable technology mix in the Arabian and India fuel markets. WesternGeco pretax income of $88 million reflected a decline in pretax margins of 25.1 percentage points to 14.7%. Marine decreased from direct third quarter results through lower vessel utilization and a high number of transits while the low level of multi-claim sales depressed margins significantly. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate before the impact of the exceptional charges was 21.5% which was in line with last quarter. The ETR is expected to be in the low 20’s for 2009. Net debt was $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, presenting a sequential improvement of  $600 million. Further we ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $1.8 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remain unused and were available at the end of December. This compares to short term debt of only $1.6 billion reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet and leaving us with more than enough liquidity to meet all corporate and operational requirements. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $154 million of the stock buyback program; $234 million of pension funding; and $1.25 billion of CapEx including $83 million multi-client surveys capitalized. During the quarter we bought back 2.7 million shares for $154 million at an average price of $57.05. Given the current credit and economic environment, we anticipate that the total dollar amount of stock repurchases in 2009 will be significantly less than the $1.8 billion spent during 2008. This anticipated reduction will serve to increase Schlumberger’s financial flexibility during these uncertain times. Our stock buyback activity during 2009 will continue to be targeted to offset any dilution caused by our stock-based compensation programs.   Oilfield Services CapEx is expected to approach $2.2 billion in 2009, while WesternGeco CapEx is expected to reach $800 million in 2009. This includes $385 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels. And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould:  Thank you Simon. Good morning everybody. Oilfield Services full year 2008 revenue of $24.28 billion increased 20% versus 2007, driven by area growth of 28% in Latin America; 24% in Europe/CIS/Africa; 18% in Middle East/Asia; and 11% in North America. All technologies experienced double-digit growth, most notably in well services, drilling measurements and wireline. Sequentially, however, Oilfield Service revenue declined in the fourth quarter, largely due to the weakening of many local currencies against the U.S. dollar, as well as to lower activity in Russia and with the exception of North America generally weaker activity around the globe. This general weakness was partly due to seasonal weather affects and partly to initial client curtailment of spending. As a consequence, with the exception of North America, pretax operating margins declined. Looking at the areas in more detail, sequential performance in North America was led by the U.S. Gulf of Mexico geo-market, as activity recovered from the slowdown of the hurricane season in the third quarter and as higher, ultra deep water rig comp led to strong demand for wireline well testing and well services technologies. On land, revenue in the U.S. land west geo-market increased on demand for well services and drilling and measurement services and artificial lift products, while the Alaska geo-market saw a seasonal build-up in activity that resulted in robust demand for well services and drilling and measurement technologies. Also on the positive side, Schlumberger Information Solutions experienced growth from seasonally strong year-end software and hardware sales. These increases however were partially offset by the U.S. land central and northern geo-markets, where the reducing rig comp that accelerated in the [courser] end resulted in lower revenue. In Canada, revenue was lower primarily due to the weakening Canadian dollar. Sequential revenue in Latin America fell, with activity for wireline and well services technologies and completions products in the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago geo-market decreased and as the Mexico/Central America geo-market suffered lower activity and integrated management operations. These decreases however were partially offset by strength in the Brazil geo-market from higher offshore expiration related demand for wireline, well testing and drilling and measurement services, and in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador geo-market from strong demand for artificial lift and information solutions products. Overall area revenue was reduced by an estimated 4% due to the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar. In Europe, CIS, and Africa, sequential revenue declined by 5% due to the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in the North Sea, continental Europe and Russia. Russia also saw significant reductions in activity from lower customer spending, in addition to the seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin.  Activity however increased in the Libya geo-market with strong oil demand for artificial lift products and for drilling and measurements, well testing and wireline services. The continental Europe geo-market also grew with higher demand for wireline and drilling and measurements technologies. In the Middle East/Asia area, revenue decreased as a result of seasonal weather related effects in the Australia/Papua/New Guinea/New Zealand and in the China/Japan/Korea geo-markets. Lower activity in [Gata] as projects were completed and less favorable activity mix in Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, and reduced customer spending in China, Japan, and Korea in the Arabian geo-markets all affected revenue. While these declines primarily affected wireline drilling and measurements and well services activity, they were partially offset by growth in the Gulf geo-market for artificial lift products, well services, and drilling and measurements technologies.  At WesternGeco the sequential 33% decline in quarterly revenue was largely due to decreases in marine which was affected by vessel transit, dry docks and project start ups. Multi-client revenue also decreased significantly as customers reduced discretionary spending. Margins suffered in consequence. At the end of the year, however, WesternGeco benefited from an all-time record backlog of $1.8 billion, underpinned by a number of long term contracts. The sharp drop in oil and gas prices due to lower demand, higher inventories and the belief that demand will erode further in 2009 as a result of reduced economic activity, is leading to rapid and substantial reductions and an expiration in production expenditure. At current prices most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources are not economic to develop. It would also take time for inflation to be removed from the system and to bring refining and development costs more in lower with lower oil and gas prices. We therefore expect 2009 activity to weaken across the board, with the most significant declines occurring in North America natural gas drilling, Russian oil production enhancement, and mature offshore basins. Expiration of offshore will be somewhat curtailed, but commitments already planned are likely to be honored. Seismic expenditures, particularly for multi-client data, are likely to decrease from last year and pricing erosion will compound these effects on revenue. In this market we are taking the necessary action to adjust our operating cost base while preserving our long term commitment to technology to element, key skill sets, and service and product quality. The key indicator of future recovery in Oilfield Services activity will be a stabilization and recovery in the demand for oil. The recent years of increased expiration and production spending have not been sufficient to substantially improve the supply situation. The age of the production base, accelerating decline rates, the smaller size of recently developed fields will mean that any prolonged reduction in investment will sow the seeds of a strong rebound. We have no doubt that Schlumberger will emerge from the current downturn a stronger company, better positioned to participate in the subsequent upturn. And I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.
Malcolm Theobald:  Thank you Andrew. We will now open the call for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  Andrew, I was wondering in your view how does this cycle compare to other cycles you’ve experienced in your career? Would you put this more closely aligned with the ’97 to ’99 period or more like the ’80 to ’86 period?
Andrew Gould:  Actually I think it’s a bit different from both because the precipitous drop in the oil prices combined with the contraction of the general economy. So actually the biggest difference I see from both sort of the mid-80s and as well as ’97, ’98 is the speed with which everybody’s reacting. Our customers are reacting at a much faster pace than they probably did even in ’97, ’98 which was a very sharp cycle.  I mean my general comment is these cycles as I experience them are getting much sharper in their amplitude and shorter in their duration. Now of course that depends on the general economy. But I would say the big difference that I see so far is the speed with which everyone’s reacting.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  Just in the prior periods it always had taken longer for the international markets to adjust to the changes relative to North America and a lot of that has to do with long term contracts, but again on what you just said about your customers acting more quickly, do these contracts still provide that chance that the international markets could bleed lower and extend out into 2010? I don’t want you to get specific but just trying to get a general – I’m trying to handicap it myself, so I don’t know if we’re going to bleed lower like we did the last couple cycles or if you think ’09 is really the ultimate trough here.
Andrew Gould:  I think the simple answer is I don’t know. I think that our customers they are not going to break contracts but they are going to pressure us to swap price for volume or price for duration or things like that. So where they have an opportunity they’re definitely going to act on price. But I don’t think that they’re going to break contracts.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs.
Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs:  Andrew, I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about your conversations with the national oil companies. I know they all probably have different goals and breakeven points on various projects, but if you could generally just talk about what you’re seeing from them. They’ve obviously accumulated a lot of cash over the last few years. How are you seeing them spending through this cycle?
Andrew Gould:  Well, I don’t think there’s – it’s very difficult to generalize on them like that. But you know the ones that are mixed, in other words they have some private ownership, I think they will react to very much as private industry does. The ones that are entirely state owned, if they have cash I think they will spread out their programs but I doubt they will cancel them, because they don’t want to really compromise their long term position in this industry. So I think that there’s a very mixed reaction. But if I had to generalize it, if they can spread their programs over a longer period of time they’re likely to do so.
Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs:  And can you just give us a sense globally or internationally? You talk about a little bit at the markets that you see, and you mentioned earlier Russia slowing down. Can you touch a little bit on Latin America and the different parts of Europe where you see maybe holding up a little bit better versus slowing down a little bit more?
Andrew Gould:  Well I think Latin America will be a mixture. There are at least two geo-markets in Latin America that will remain very healthy and two that will probably weaken fairly dramatically. So I think overall there is a good chance that Latin America will be flat, flattish over the whole year. But it’s very early for me to commit to that, but that’s the way we would see it today. If you look at Europe then you know parts of central Europe will hold up, the North Sea will weaken, a lot of weakness – actually almost all of our weakness is quartered in North Sea came from the devaluation of the pound against the U.S. dollar. But it will weaken over the year. If you look at Africa we see some Bolivia, Nigeria, North Africa access will hold up pretty well. And offshore West Africa the big guys will hold up really well, but some of the small independents who were doing expiration will probably drop off. So you know there is a reasonable – I think overall I have to – I hate to go on being negative, but overall I suspect Europe, Africa, CIS will be down. And there will be pockets of strength with the big customers offshore, Algeria, Libya, but the rest will be fairly weak.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  Andrew if I could ask you to clarify your comment on the inflation and the unwinding of it, particularly I think when we think F&D inflation we tend to think oilfield pricing and clearly the biggest components there were rigs and steel, two businesses you’re not in. So first I guess clarify that with respect to oilfield pricing. And then secondly, how you could be actually benefiting from inflation unwinding in terms of Europe.
Andrew Gould:  Well, actually my remark was you don’t drill without a rig and you don’t build a platform without steel. So the really high inflation ticket items in projects are undoubtedly what our customers are going to want to come down. Now the traditional arm wrestling with the rig contractors and how they run one, I know what that’s like, will take some time to work itself through the system. That’s what I meant, Michael, okay?
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  Okay.
Andrew Gould:  The steel stuff, the input to our manufacturing be it steel, [kanel], chrome, copper, the pricing effect is fairly immediate. As soon as we’re through our inventory we see the pricing effect come in very quickly. In fact we have some of our IPM contracts with the tubular element price has been dropping by a very substantial amount on a monthly basis. So I think – but for it to really work its way through our system, in terms of material costs you’re probably looking at a year.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  I’m not putting words in your mouth then to say that this was not a statement about your own pricing structure?
Andrew Gould:  No. No. Our pricing structure will be negotiated, renegotiated as I explained in answer to an earlier question. But for my customers it’s getting the cost of the really big ticket items down that’s going to make projects become economic again or not.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Allan Block] – Bank of America.
Allan Block – Bank of America:  In a slowdown the next kind of focus usually moves to the receivables. I wanted to know if you could comment on recent pressure the Port of Vaasa owing somewhere near $8 billion and they stopped paying. Are there other areas in the world where you’re seeing this type of pressure from your customers where they’re running out of money and extending you on the receivable side?
Andrew Gould:  No, not significantly. I think there’s a bigger risk from some of the smaller independents than there is from the other international companies. Terms will undoubtedly extend, they always do in a downturn. But since I’ve been in this business we’ve never not been paid by anyone.
Allan Block – Bank of America:  When they stretch out they do – usually they catch up on them –
Andrew Gould:  Well, never say never but when I first joined Schlumberger one of the NOC’s didn’t pay us and they paid us seven years later. But Simon we’ve never not been paid, no?
Simon Ayat:  No, I confirm. As a matter of fact in the Q4 we improved our receivable situation. That’s part of the improvement in net debt that I spoke about.
Allan Block – Bank of America:  Your expectations are then that most will stay current right now, or there like I said before are there areas in the world where you’re worried about this happening as well?
Andrew Gould:  We’re not, no we’re not. We haven’t seen any – well we’ve seen an improvement as Simon said. But if we look at specific companies I don’t think we’ve seen any significant deterioration yet that leads us to worry. I have to say that we put our field people on credit watch back in September, so they have been doing a lot of quality operating of the customer exposure since last September. 
Allan Block – Bank of America:  Given the changes in the dynamics of demand, are you changing your marketing or pricing strategies at all in any particular markets?
Andrew Gould:  Well, I wouldn’t want to say that over the phone. My competitors are undoubtedly listening. But yes everybody has to adapt to the current market circumstances.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  Andrew, just going back to what you said about coming after this downturn and a stronger company, what is your reflections of how the whole cycle is playing out? And is there any specific Schlumberger there relative to competitors? And will there be consolidation or market share gains into that?
Andrew Gould:  I think it’s much easier for companies with very strong balance sheets to operate in this environment because we can still make investments that we think are going to pay off in the long term. As I said last October we will be more opportunistic in acquisitions than we’ve been perhaps during the period when we felt that valuations were out of hand. And generally we will not – we never adjust our R&D in any significant way during these downturns which means that when you turn up again, you have been able to renew a considerable part of your product and service portfolio. So if that recipe still works, that’s what I meant, Ole.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  What do you think of the terms that when we come out of this downturn that the competitive landscape will have meaningfully changed?
Andrew Gould:  I don’t know. I mean I think that – you can see already that some of the smaller companies that went with private equity are struggling, so they may get snapped up. Whether there will be a larger consolidation I don’t know, Ole.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  If I can just move onto block 31, it was kind of buried in the middle of the press release. And by the way your press release seems to be particularly aggressively sprinkled with the contract awards on technology this time around, so just wondering if we should read anything into that specifically. But particularly block 31, could you talk a little bit about just you seem to have gone sort of full house there on the service side and what part of that was incumbent and what was new awards?
Andrew Gould:  I actually don’t know off the top of my head. I certainly know that wireline was incumbent. I’m not sure about drilling and measurements, and well services we were partly incumbent. I would say we were incumbent on quite a lot of this. But don’t forget, this is moving to the development stage so the scope is very different.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  And then you’ve been successful in completion in deport in West Africa versus some of your previous competitors. Has completion been awarded yet on block 31?
Andrew Gould:  Yes.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  Has that been announced?
Andrew Gould :  I don’t know. But it’s not in our press release so it’s not us, Ole.
Operator:  Your next question comes from J. David Anderson – UBS.
J. David Anderson – UBS:  Andrew getting back to some of the past downturns, I’m just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on applying some of the lessons you learned during the last downturn to now. Just curious if that was a factor in the timing of your decision to cut your workforce. I guess my question is did you move the timing up because your outlook is really becoming more negative and your looking at the past and you decided to make a decision here?
Andrew Gould:  Actually when I compare the way we’re managing that to ’97, ’98 we actually today have much, much better data. That’s the first difference. The second difference – and data about our own workforce, I mean. Where it is, who it is, you know – what the loading is, all the rest of it. The other thing is that in previous cycles, including ’97, ’98 we used to listen to our customers about what we thought was going to happen in the market. And since then where we suffered really badly from listening, we make up our own minds. So I would say that the decision that we had to make a workforce cut was probably made in November. And you know the actual – we don’t make press releases about these things but the cut actually concerns about 5,000 people worldwide.
J. David Anderson – UBS:  So have you become incrementally more negative over the last two months?
Andrew Gould:  Yes.
J. David Anderson – UBS:  You also talked about the speed of the spending cuts being faster than in past downturns.
Andrew Gould:  Yes.
J. David Anderson – UBS:  Do you see much of a difference between the IOC’s and the NOC’s reacting right now? And is this more of a credit issue? I mean I’m hearing it seems like credit can be more of an issue than commodities. I don’t know if there’s any way you can comment on that.
Andrew Gould:  I think credit is an issue for the sort of ecosystems that grew up, particularly in the London A market, maybe in Russia a bit and also in the U.S. where people spend. You know I don’t have any cash flow like the expiration companies in London who traditionally spent 125% or 150% of their cash flow as the case in North America. So obviously the credit crunch has had an effect on the speed of the contraction, yes.
J. David Anderson – UBS:  With regards to the offshore sector you talked about a lot of contracts in place, you keep that work out there. Just wondering if the customers have their rig rates locked in already and they’re looking to cut costs in other ways, does that mean it comes down to you guys? Are you guys starting to get a lot of pushback on your pricing right now? And how is your pricing structure offshore? I mean, how flexible is that?
Andrew Gould:  Well I mean of course we’re going to get pushback from the pricing. But the factor in the pricing of an offshore development is tiny compared to some of the other ones. And what they will do is some of the big, new expensive rigs that were slated for expiration will be moved to development if they can’t get out of their contract. Because an expiration rig does not produce cash flow. A development rig does.
Operator:  Your next question comes from William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  Russia not getting a whole lot of attention with regard to the potential I guess production response to the implosion and drilling activity that we’re seeing real time. Can you comment on that in terms of what you’re seeing ground level and what your expectations are as the year unfolds with the continued collapse in rig activity?
Andrew Gould:  I think from the reports the production is dropping now. I think that were drilling activity to remain as low as it’s been coming for a year or so it would be a very significant decline in production. I don’t want to give a number, but a very significant decline though.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  Could you – again, a difficult question to answer because it’s about depth and duration, as you look out into 2009 what are your expectations with regard to a year-over-year decline in [inaudible] capital spending in Russia on a percentage basis, if you will.
Andrew Gould:  Actually we haven’t – you don’t – so you have to divide the Russian market into three. The IOC’s particularly in Sakhalin there will be no decline. The small Russian companies that depended on credit markets will probably just not drill. And what we’re looking at at the moment the hypothesis we’re working on is that there will – I can’t give you this in money, but in the total meters drilled we’re looking at a drop of somewhere between 10 and 20%. Total meters drilled.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  That’s for the whole market.
Andrew Gould:  Yes. For the – essentially for the western Siberia and southern Russia market. Let me put it this way, Bill, the mature market.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  I would suspect that the pricing pressure that the service industry is encountering in Russia is fairly acute, no?
Andrew Gould:  Yes it is.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  We have a decent slug of new build [inaudible] vessels coming into the market this year, the eastern eco-boats. What is the plan with regard to your resisting fleets, your older vessels? Do we plan on stacking those or mothballing or do you not know at this stage?
Andrew Gould:  No, actually when we bought Eastern Eco we made a contingency plan. We didn’t think we’d have to use it but we may have to use it. And if we do have to use it the first thing is we still have some leased vessels and luckily a lot of those lease vessels we can release in ’09. That would leave us with almost 100% owned fleet and in that case if we have to stack we will park them in a field somewhere.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  With regard to your receivable policy I hear you with regard to national oil companies eventually making a hole, but what is the policy with regard to the carrying value of these receivables on the balance sheet? Is there a certain threshold at which you have to start writing them down, call it six months to a year?
Andrew Gould:  I’ll let Simon comment but we have a policy, yes.
Simon Ayat:  So basically we have a policy where we look on an item by item basis. We don’t take general provisions. We do analyze our receivable divided by areas. Geo-markets have very good visibility. And we look at our receivables item by item basis. So we don’t take a general provision like we announced now. We took a particular provision that related to a specific client. And this is how we look at it. So we don’t have a general policy that based off on aging. It is more particular to the client and what we know from the client and the discussion with them and the timing to be paid.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.:  So for example if you were to have some vulnerabilities attended to NOC yet they historically have made you whole with regard to receivables, how would you – how would the carrying value of those receivables adjust if any?
Simon Ayat:  We will look at our experience with the NOC, the discussion that’s ongoing with them. And we’ll make the decision on those basis. Now if it goes beyond a certain timeframe, yes, a prudent accounting approach we might take a provision. But this again would be dependent on the circumstances.
Andrew Gould:  Bill, historically the payment patterns of our NOC customers tend to get reflected in the pricing we practice.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Byron Pope - Tudor Pickering & Co. Securities.
Byron Pope - Tudor Pickering & Co. Securities:  Andrew you speak to pricing erosion and your U.S. land central and north geo-markets. I’m assuming that refers primarily to well simulation or are you also concerned we could see it in some of your other product and service lines in those specific geo-markets?
Andrew Gould:  Well essentially those. It would be pressure pumping.
Byron Pope - Tudor Pickering & Co. Securities:  With regard to your Oilfield Services CapEx being down roughly 28% year-over-year, historically your CapEx spend has been fairly consistent with kind of your revenue mix. As we think about that decline year-over-year is it fair to think about North America bearing more of the brunt of the reductions? Or is that not a fair characterization?
Andrew Gould:  Yes, I think that’s probably a fair characterization. Yes. The brunt no, but proportionately more yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from James Crandell - Barclays Capital.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  Two questions. One, I understand that Pemex intends to move forward with as many as eight, 500 well packages that Chicontepec in 2009. Could you comment on that? And also talk about when your contracts expire, when you end your current stage of work at Chicontepec?
Andrew Gould:  Well the only [co] ones I’m prepared to comment on are the 8TGE three and four, which have been announced. Beyond that I’m not prepared to speculate on what Pemex might or might do. And we have – our current contacts actually we have been awarded some extensions to make up for some of the shortage of wells that Pemex feel they have, and therefore I think our Chicontepec contract with its extensions will carry us through most of this year.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  Secondly and I was even given all your explanations I was still surprised over the magnitude of the drop in seismic profitability relative to the revenues. Could you perhaps expand on that? And given where you were in the fourth quarter, where would you see the overall direction of profit margins from the fourth quarter levels in your seismic [inaudible]?
Andrew Gould:  Well I think you have to remember that the third quarter is the strong quarter in the North Sea, and the North Sea has the highest seismic pricing in the world. So you’ve got a compounded effect of the boats moving to lower priced contracts outside the North Sea, transit times, and you also got – we had a number of boats in dry dock during the fourth quarter. So I – the magnitude is surprising. I agree with you, but it’s quite logical. There’s nothing particularly startling. I mean obviously in a port where you have transits and dry docks you can’t reduce your fixed costs very much in marine. The other portion of it was the, which we had somewhat anticipated, was the absence of multi-client both in North America and overseas during the fourth quarter.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  So some of this at least going forward at least should lessen, so would you expect overall your relative profitability in that business in terms of margin should improve over the next couple of quarters?
Andrew Gould:  Yes. I’m not sure – Q1’s not a good proxy like Q4 but certainly in the second quarter yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Presumably the cuts that you put in place in terms of headcount expense and CapEx stem from your planning process. At that level of employment and spend what does that imply or what are you planning on in terms of activity levels? Just trying to get a sense for where your head’s at and are you staffed for that expected level or is there just kind of a Part B if things deteriorate further?
Andrew Gould:  While we obviously have an overall plan at the level of Schlumberger Limited, as a feel for people’s visibility beyond Q2 it’s still very poor. We’ve asked them to make a plan in two parts. So first half year plan, second half year plan. And we will revisit the second half year plan in April, May. The headcount adjustment we made now which as I pointed out in an earlier question was planned in November was to adjust to what we felt activity levels were likely to be in the first quarter if not half year. Now in fact we’re seeing – the situation is so dynamic, that I cannot rule out that we would not make another headcount adjustment in the first half year. And secondly depending on what comes in as the plan in April, May for the second half we will probably have to look at it again. It’s so dynamic that I’m not going to say that an adjustment we made is for anything beyond the visibility we have over the next three to six months.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities:  And shifting back to the seismic business, at least one good day to point there to backlog up again. Roughly how long does that carry you? Does that get you halfway through ’09, through three-quarters? 
Andrew Gould:  Actually what happened is Dalton and I agreed earlier last year that the time was to go long. And so roughly half that backlog will be executed in – no, slightly more than that, sorry. North of  $1 billion is in the next 12 months and the balance will be in the following year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.:  Just to pick up on that last question if I could. You clearly have a great deal of confidence in WesternGeco backlog. Can you help us understand why?
Andrew Gould:  Well, because with the exception of one or two contracts who are with very reputable contracts, the work has already started.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.:  And you feel like once they start they’re going to complete the program as originally conceived?
Andrew Gould:  We’re talking about very reputable companies breaking contracts. They might shorten the program but I don’t see them breaking contracts, Geoff.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.:  Could I ask you to just elaborate a little bit on the comment in the press release about at current prices, most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources are not economic to develop. What are you referring to in terms of new categories of hydrocarbon resources?
Andrew Gould:  Advanced EOR, Ultra Deep, Heavy Oil, [Tarsands], let alone coal to liquids or gas to liquids. There’s a very good graph, Geoff, in the International Energy Agency 2008 Outlook that shows the cost as of the time they did it in November, which each of these categories can be developed.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.:  And then kind of a follow-on, the deep water market – what are you expecting? You made a couple of comments already this morning. There are a lot of new rigs coming out. Do you expect that deep water activity, defined however you want to, will in fact increase in ’09 versus ’08 with the [inaudible] new rigs?
Andrew Gould:  Yes. Yes. Definitely. I think some of the rigs as I said in an earlier question will be pushed – instead of doing the expiration they were planned for will be pushed for development because development brings cash flow. But I don’t see any huge reduction in the deep water commitments that people have already undertaken. I think it’s far more a question for 2010, Geoff.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.:  And the combination of volume increase but a mixed shift for development translates to an impact on Schlumberger how?
Andrew Gould:  Well, we don’t make as much money in development as we do in expiration as you know. So you know to the extent that there is a shift – the service intensity in development is much less than in expiration. So it actually reduces our scope to sell to a certain extent.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Brad Handler - Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  I guess first question I come back to the U.S. market, can you give us an update on kind of the contract renegotiation status? You know a year ago we heard a lot about the process of negotiating pricing particularly in pumping but I think it was broader than that for the U.S. market for the coming year and it sounds like that has been delayed to some degree. Can you update us on that?
Andrew Gould:  I think that it’s best to say that customers knowing they were going to lay down rigs and therefore would have more bargaining power pushed out the contact renegotiation into much later than they normally would have done. I would think that we’re probably about 70% through it now for the key product lines, yes.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  So just to key on that, to the point that we will start to see the impact of those discussions in Q1 or is it more of a Q2?
Andrew Gould:  No, I think you’ll see them in Q1. But you know sorting out the effect of the new contracts from the drop in rigs and all the rest of it is going to be quite complicated.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  On a relative basis versus the prior year for a percentage of work and again your comment makes it more complicated to answer this, but to the percentage of work that you expect will prove to be under some form of contract versus the spot market?
Andrew Gould:  I don’t think it will change very much, no. So you know 60, 70% will be under contract. Now what the scope of those contracts is going to be, I don’t know because rigs are dropping so fast it’s difficult to tell.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  Are they presumably of the same nature? Are they sort of covering a certain area? For what work is done, here’s the price –
Andrew Gould:  Yes.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  Can you comment – would you be willing just to make a comment if the consensus EPS is sitting at $3.50 can you comment on how you all feel about that consensus number, just to try to get it out there?
Andrew Gould:  Well, given the way I’ve been talking this morning, I suspect that the consensus number will come down from $3.50.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.:  Simon, there was a decent sized jump in the post-retirement benefits line. I wondered – I guess I hadn’t really looked at it and so maybe it’s been moving up through the year, but I wondered what the explanation for that is. Is that a number that goes higher in ’09?
Simon Ayat:  So there’s two explanations for that. One big part of the increase was related to a decision we made in the fourth quarter to convert a pension scheme we have for our international mobile staff from a defined contribution to a defined benefit. In other words, we given the market condition, we felt that we would take the risk and convert it to a defined benefit. It was a target benefit associated with the average carrier. Now the other part is no secret. It’s the value of the assets due to the market condition dropped. Now overall including the international mobile pension plan, we are about 70% funded. So this is why you see this big shift between the two layers.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.:  So then obviously x stock market conditions, the number now of the $2.37 billion is representative of where you’re going to be going forward?
Simon Ayat:  Well, I mean, this would be dependent on the first as you said the value of the assets, the market condition. But we also plan to fund some of these shortfalls. In a few quarter we put some money, $230 million and we have spare money to fund the different plans during 2009. So it will be hopefully less.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.:  And then is the aim – you know, obviously huge uncertainty here in terms of how far down, but pretty still lower but fairly robust CapEx program. Is the aim to be cash neutral this year or is that possible I guess in the [inaudible] environment?
Andrew Gould:  Let me comment on that, Kevin. We planned to be cash neutral but we have a lot of options to stay very cash positive.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.:  And would that include cuts in CapEx?
Andrew Gould:  Yes. Did you hear him explain we did an H-1, H-2 plan? So we do the H-2 plan in May we’ll look at the CapEx again.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.:  So actually post the 1Q conference call.
Andrew Gould:  Yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.:  Just a little bit of follow up on seismic. If you could talk about sort of the difference in you commented about it, a rapid decline in library demand but yet the increase in the backlog. Is it customer mix or is it basically a data driven demand?
Andrew Gould:  No, the backlog is not – there’s very little multi-client in the backlog. The backlog is marine and land acquisition or third party processing. Actually there is a very interesting difference between this cycle and the last down cycle in seismic. Because the last down cycle in seismic, WesternGeco had a balance sheet library value of approximately $1.1 billion. And this time it’s less then $300.
Simon Ayat:  It’s $282.
Andrew Gould:  It’s $282, and the multi-client that we are going to shoot through the first two-thirds of this year is already very adequately pre-funded. Because you know one of the dangers of the seismic business is everyone goes off and starts shooting multi-client without funding. I think this time around most of the seismic companies’ balance sheets are such that they won’t do that unless they have pre-funding.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.:  My follow on to it relates to the margins and I imagine just from the magnitude of the revenue contribution from the marine versus the library, but the margins in the library significantly better because of the depreciate just as you point out. Was that a large contribution to the decline, the decrements, because of less library? Or really all driven mostly by they had dry docks and transit times?
Andrew Gould:  I think it’s far more driven by the choppy quarter in marine, you know. The fact that we had dry docks and transits and you can’t cut the fixed costs when you’re just moving boats around.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.:  As pointed out earlier that’s the biggest driver, depending on –
Andrew Gould:  Yes. Yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup:  Andrew as you plan for the North America – the continued drop in North American activity you mentioned that this downturn is different from previous ones in several respects. Do you expect a kind of a B-shaped bottom to the North American drilling decline as we’ve seen in the last two downturns? Or is this something in your mind possibly very different?
Andrew Gould:  The answer, Robin, is I don’t know yet because so much of what happens in North America is going to depend on a recovery in industrial [inaudible] I guess. And there are some things out there that could make it very positive. For example, if the new administration decommissions some coal-fired generating plants, that could increase gas demand fairly dramatically. The other unknown is what is the true decline rate of some of these new Shell Gas horizontal wells? So the answer is I don’t know at this point in time. But I would say the key factor is when demand starts to recover.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup:  On all the various currency impacts that you mentioned, and I assume some of the big ones are the pound, Canadian dollar, the Russian currency, do you have a aggregate impact of based on various markets of what that was in the negative sense in the most recent quarter?
Andrew Gould:  Simon.
Simon Ayat:  Basically we highlighted the impact of the currency on the top line. And the fact is, we don’t have impact of those currencies on a profitability. Our as a matter of fact, the stronger dollar overall is a slightly positive for us. But definitely on the top line as you highlighted, certain countries like Canada and North Sea, we have a high portion in the local currency. And some other markets much lower. But overall we are quite balanced between the income between these currencies and our costs and on a profitability basis there is no impact.
Operator:  Your last question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  I appreciate the opportunity to follow up and it’s related to CapEx. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the priorities of the $2.2 billion in Oilfield with respect to replacement capital, new technology deployment, project related, etc.
Andrew Gould:  There’s an awful lot of project related deep water CapEx. There is a lot of CapEx related to gas overseas. And after that I would say those probably if you like the new categories, Michael, then I would say its replacement and new technology.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  So if I think about a Plan B on the CapEx side in the second half it would really be subject to potential deferrals on gas and deep water, probably the biggest areas?
Andrew Gould:  Probably. Yes. Or the fact that there had been some idling in the offshore market that allows us to take CapEx from other offshore rigs and put them on new ones.

Operator:  Welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Malcolm Theobald. 
Malcolm Theobald:  Before we begin I'd like to review the logistics and format of today's call.  Some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. And now for the call participants and format: Joining the call from New York City are both Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the third quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results.  And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat:  Schlumberger third quarter income from continuing operations was $1.25 per share, up $0.09 sequentially and $0.16 above the same quarter last year. These results include a $0.04 impact from the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Oilfield Services third quarter revenue grew 5% sequentially, reflecting strong growth in all geographical areas despite the impact of the hurricane season. WesternGeco revenue grew 33% sequentially, reflecting the seasonal strength in Marine operations that was boosted by strong multi client data sales. Oilfield Services generated $1.7 billion in pre-tax operating income, essentially flat as compared to the second quarter, with margins slipping by 155 basis points to 26.7%.  By area, Oilfield Services pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows. My comments are on a sequential basis. North America pre-tax margin decreased by 283 basis points to 21.1%, where the recovery and activity in Canada was more than offset by the hurricane effects on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico activity and the seasonal slowdown in Alaska. Latin America pre-tax margin declined 287 basis points to 20.1% as more favorable activity mix in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil were insufficient to offset increased third-party managed services in IPM projects in the Mexico/Central America geomarket. This effect was amplified by start up costs [inaudible] Burgos 7 project in Mexico. For ECA, the Europe/CIS/Africa area, the pre-tax margin improved 86 basis points to 29% as Russia experiences strong seasonal activity rebound offshore East Russia. This improvement, however, was partially offset by the impact of declines in the North Sea for both exploration and development operations. Finally, Middle East/Asia pre-tax margin moderated by 89 basis points to 35.5% as a more favorable activity mix in a number of geomarkets was insufficient to counter the effects of a less-favorable mix in Indonesia and a shift to lower margin workover-type activity in the Gulf. WesternGeco pre-tax income of $355 million, reflecting an increase in pre-tax margin by 10.6 percentage points to reach 39.8%, showed a strong growth over the second quarter and surpassed the performance of the same quarter last year.  Marine had a strong quarter, with higher activity at better pricing while multi client margins improved with higher sales. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 21.4%, which was slightly higher than last quarter due to the geographic mix of earnings in WesternGeco. The ETR is expected to be in the low 20s for the total year. Net debt was $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, representing a sequential improvement of $300 million. Further, we ended the quarter with approximately $4 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $2.1 billion of committed debt facility agreements with commercial banks were available at the end of September. This compares to short-term debt of only $2.2 billion, reflecting the strength of the Schlumberger balance sheet and leaving us with more than enough liquidity to meet all corporate and operational requirements. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $545 million for the stock buyback program and $1 billion for Capex, including $75 million of multi client surveys capitalized.  During the quarter we bought back 5.96 million shares for $545 million at an average price of $91.45 per share.  Finally, the quarter earnings included $44 million of expenses relating to share-based compensation costs. And now I'll turn the conference over to Andrew. 
Andrew F. Gould:  The strong continuation in sequential revenue growth in the third quarter was led by further strengthening of gas drilling activity on land in the U.S. and Canada, a very active summer drilling season in Russia, and continuing growth of IPM activity in Latin America.  Margin performance was generally satisfactory apart from the heavy impact of the hurricane season on North America and higher than usual third-party managed services revenue at low margins in Latin America due in part to the start up of the Burgos 7 contract. Among our technologies, growth was strongest for well services, wireline and drilling and measurement services. Looking at the areas in more detail, performance in North America was led by the Canada geomarket, as activities strengthened significantly following last quarter's spring breakup. Demand was strong for a range of technologies, from well services, wireline and drilling and measurements on land in the U.S., and improving weather in the North and expanding rig count across all geomarkets yielded a solid result. These positive effects were partially offset by a sharp reduction in activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico resulting from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike as well as by the seasonal slowdown in Alaska for rig and infrastructure maintenance.  In Latin America, sequential revenue growth was strong across the area, led by Mexico/Central America geomarket due to increased IPM activity. In addition, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador continued their robust performance of the second quarter on a more favorable mix of wireline and drilling and measurements technologies, while Brazil grew as exploration activity led to more demand for wireline logging services. Sequential revenue growth in the Europe/Africa/CIS area was driven primarily by activity in the Russian geomarkets, particularly in the East, with the summer exploration campaigns in the North and South. Through demand for well services, pressure pumpings remain strong as well. Exploration was also responsible for the strength in the Caspian through both activity and service mix. In Africa, Libya was particularly strong, as activity grew in both exploration and development work, and Western Southern Africa also recorded exploration-related growth.  These positive factors were somewhat tempered by a decrease in North Sea activity in both exploration and development that matched an effective rig count reduction.  In the Middle East and Asia area, sequential growth was led by Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines geomarket, with increased exploration activity resulting in robust demand for exploration led wireline and well testing services. The geomarket also benefited from strong completions product sales. Good results in Qatar came through service mix that outpaced rig count, while the East Mediterranean and Arabian geomarkets also saw improvement. The area's sequential growth was, however, blunted by a decrease in the Gulf as activity shifted from drilling to workover-type services.  At WesternGeco, sequential revenue grew significantly, led by excellent Marine results and a strong recovery in multi client data sales. The third quarter is seasonally the strongest in Marine, and the results were backed by strong activity in the North Sea and the transfer of three vessels from multi client to proprietary service during the quarter.  In multi client, increased sales were seen in North America, Latin America and Europe, with the result in North America underpinned by a significant sale in the U.S.  Data processing also recorded higher revenue, particularly in Europe, North America and India. The positive combination of this performance, however, was partially offset by a decrease in land revenue, with activity reduced and contracts were completed in North Africa and Latin America.  At our investor conference on September 30th, we highlighted a number of unique Schlumberger technologies that both singly and together offer marked benefits in helping our customers improve performance and reduce risk. The manner in which these technologies can be integrated also offers substantial customer benefit, and a number of these were evident during the quarter.  I would draw particular attention to the StimMAP LIVE real-time fracture mapping and stimulation as well as to our full-azimuth Coil Shooting Q-Marine data acquisition as examples. I would also point out the continuing uptake of PeriScope and other members of the Scope family of technologies, with jobs performed in Texas, Alaska, Italy, Ecuador and Brazil.  As we enter the fourth quarter, the recent rapid deterioration in credit markets will undoubtedly have an effect on our activity, though we anticipate this will be largely limited to North America and to some emerging exploration markets overseas. The strengthening production profile of North American natural gas has also led a number of customers to reduce spending early.  At the present time, the rate at which the world economy will slow has become increasingly uncertain. We have always maintained that the one event that could slow the rate of increase in worldwide exploration and production spending would be a reduction in the demand for oil caused by a severe global recession. At the moment it is still too soon to predict to what extent current events will affect global activity in 2009, but we anticipate a slowing in the rate of increase of our customers' spending. However, the weakness of the current supply base, the age of the production profile, and the decrease in reserve replacement ratios - all of which we have indicated on many occasions are such that any significant drop in exploration and production investment would rapidly provoke an even stronger recovery.  Schlumberger has an unparalleled technology position, a strong balance sheet, an unmatched global presence, and an excellent and highly motivated work force. I have no doubt that we will emerge from the current turmoil even stronger than before. We will now take questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Anderson - UBS.
David Anderson - UBS:  Andrew, I was just wondering, just looking at International land, is it fair to say the majority of your projected 2009 business is already locked up, either through contracts or long-standing agreements?
Andrew F. Gould: Specifically land, Dave?
David Anderson - UBS: Yes, just International land.
Andrew F. Gould: I would say for the drilling programs that certainly the first half year to nine months are locked up. As you know well, that's not true for workover programs. In other words, they're on a much shorter time scope and could eventually be canceled. 
David Anderson - UBS: And then if I look more just towards offshore work, is it fair to say there'd be probably a much larger percentage of that locked up because it can be linked with drilling contracts?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. I mean, I think that the fundamental cycle of three-year contracts overseas hasn't changed a great deal, so you can assume that one-third will rollover in 2009.
David Anderson - UBS: But with the contracts that are existing in place, can you envision any scenario in which you start to see contracts being broke? I think that's a pretty big concern in the investor community right now.
Andrew F. Gould: Well, the operators don't break contracts. They shut down rigs. You know, normally a contract is for a specific or an envelope of rigs, and they can always shut down rigs within the contract. So it depends on the drilling contract, Dave.
David Anderson - UBS: And then if I could just ask one more question, looking back when oil prices peaked back in 1998, it looks like it took something like 12 months until OPEC activity really started to come down. I'd like to get your perspective on whether we should start to expect a similar pattern on OPEC and other NOCs this time around. I recognize there's a lot of changes in the market and there's not a perfect historical comparison, but perhaps you'd just give us your perspective as to how long you think it's going to take or how long oil prices have to stay low until you really see a dramatic reduction in their spending.
Andrew F. Gould: I think I would be dishonest to say that I know. I don't know, but I will give you my opinion.  My opinion is that this is 1998, but the same basic rules would apply and the period of time before they meaningfully impact activity is probably not dissimilar from what you just quoted, Dave.
David Anderson - UBS: So you think something like 12 months or so from the peak, just roughly. You think 12, 15, something like that?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. It depends because there's no such thing as two OPEC members who behave the same way, so it's very, very generalized, what I'm saying.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering & Co.
Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering & Co.:  Andrew, I just want to understand a little bit better your thoughts as they are today. Maybe six months ago, a couple of conference calls ago, we were looking at International as a 15% to 20% kind of top line growth market for you guys in '09. I realize we don't know at this point, but I'm just trying to understand order of magnitude around your comment on the rate of growth slowing. Do you think it's - I mean, are we a single-digit growth rate now? Is it a few hundred basis points softer? Kind of ballpark for us.
Andrew F. Gould: Dan, I don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know. And we're going to take this quarter by quarter, but today I have a little bit better visibility on North America because you know as well as I do what's been happening very day. But on overseas, I just don't have a good visibility to allow me to look at a number.
Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering & Co.: I guess the follow up then would be for both North America and International, you're talked historically about kind of Plan A and Plan B. Plan A is usually the markets continue to grow as you expect. Plan B is they soften. When do you pull the trigger on a Plan B in North America or on International? I mean, what's the timing? Walk us through the thought and evaluation process?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that Plan B in North America, we will be thinking in Plan B mode unless the temperature drops and heating days become such that it's obvious that gas supply, coupled with the cuts that people have made in expenditure, means that we're going to get to the end of the winter with a low storage situation. But today we're certainly thinking in Plan B mode.  So Plan B mode means that we're careful on headcount increases, we're careful on Capex. We're extremely careful on discretionary expenditure. But we have, you know, when we have Plan B in place, we're working on Plan A at the same time. So if something does change in the spring, we can react. Overseas, it's very, very different because no two areas behave the same, therefore we can't, if you like, apply a universal plan the way we can to North American gas. So I would say that the Plan B overseas, we haven't evoked any of it yet. We are being more careful. You know the areas we'll make a Plan B other than when things start to become a bit clearer.  But, you know, I have to say, between Simon Ayat to myself and Chakib Sbiti, this is the third time we've been through this. So we have quite a lot of experiences how to manage the different reactions of the different parts of the world not only on behalf of our customers, the reactions of our customers, but also the internal measures that need to be taken.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan :  Simon, maybe the first question I can throw your way and maybe ask you to expand upon how the credit crisis is impacting your business specifically and maybe some of the things that you're doing differently in light of that to make sure that Schlumberger doesn't end up with any liquidity pinch.
Simon Ayat: Michael, as I mentioned in my comment earlier on, we have $4 billion of cash. We have established credit lines committed from the banks, although unused, about $2 billion. Our cash flow this last quarter, if you noticed, we made almost $1 billion after spending $1 billion on Capex. We never rely too much on the credit market. We did - so opportunistic when we felt that it is more cost-effective to borrow than using our cash. So we're going to live off our cash flow like we did before, and we don't see this credit market to be very severe as far as our needs for cash because we have a good balance sheet and we also work very conservatively. Now as far as the receivables are concerned, we haven't experienced any delay in collections. Now this might start to affect us if there are delays for payments by our clients, but we know how to handle this and we mobilized our entire organization to make sure that the cash flow continued to come through. So we don't have any immediate concern over the credit market.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  And even specific, you mentioned receivables, any counterparty risk in terms of customers, issues related to their letters of credit, anything coming back your way?
Simon Ayat: We do reestablish the credit limits on some of the smaller clients, and the relationships with the normal, usual clients are contractual. And we have no issue with it for the time being.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  Second question, Andrew, if I can put it to you, pricing in the business I think is in general predicated upon maintaining a perception of scarcity. As we start to talk about lower utilization rates for everything from rigs to tools, etc., we lose some of that scarcity premium. Can you maybe talk about the mix shift in terms of revenue growth over the last few years, price versus technology? You've used in the past an [IEA] chart showing 70% of the [MP] Capex as being inflationary.  I would assume that Schlumberger doesn't have that kind of price inflation embedded into its revenue growth over that time frame, but I'd like to get a sense from you in terms of where you feel vulnerable in terms of pricing. 
Andrew F. Gould: Right. If you go back, I don't have to explain the dynamics of supply and demand on North American pressure pumping, I hope, but if you look more broadly across the segments in which we participate, they are not generally wholly driven by pure supply and demand. Obviously they are to an extent, right? So if you look across well services in North America, we know the answer.  Overseas, we've had similar dynamics in the pricing market in Russia for the last two years, supply/demand. If you look at wireline, drilling and measurements, I think that yes, there is, particularly in drilling and measurements, an element of pricing, particularly in 2006 which was purely supply/demand driven and it was also true to a certain extent for wireline, though to a lesser extent. But in the last two years I would say that in those services it is technology that has driven pricing more than pure supply/demand. Now I have to say as a word of caution that in tight markets when money is short, our customers tend to use a little bit less technology and it's up to us to prove that using technology is cost-effective for them. But I think that the answer to your question is that the big price sensitivity to inflation in the services where we participate, apart from pressure pumping, was really in 2005 and particularly 2006.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  Andrew, you highlight the credit environment and how certain of your customers are - they're not able to spend the same amount of capital as they otherwise would, but how about some of your competitors and particularly North America stacked up competitors in pressure pumping in wireline and workover. I mean, we've seen an army of these little companies enter the market over the past couple of years with huge ambitions and borrowed money. Are you seeing any signs that this is getting shut down now?
Andrew F. Gould: To be perfectly honest, no, not yet. I haven't seen any distress signals, Ole. You mean real distress selling type signals, right?  I think we are getting more phone calls than we got three months ago. I think we can see some deals that were made that are probably in negative equity territory and how those will unwind I think is still completely unknown. But there's not an avalanche yet of distressed people calling or sending people around to sell us stuff.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  Well, they've [inaudible] the offshore market? I mean, you highlighted quite a few offshore rigs that were coming into the market. It appears that a lot of these rig projects are relying on a lot of debt and very little equity and very few of them have gotten funded. Have you had any thoughts about how that could develop?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think it's going to - I think that both for seismic boats, by the way, and drilling rigs that the people who were financing these at the margin, they're not going to build them. They won't get built until their shipyard slot gets bought by a serious player. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  So on the seismic side, again, I certainly see your point there, but in terms of your own revenues, exploration Capex was meant to be the driver of much of the growth over the next couple of years. Historically, '98 for example, exploration Capex was one of the first things to get shut down. Could you discuss a little bit your [expulsion], how you see the seismic business or the wireline business evolve over the next 12 to 18 months?
Andrew F. Gould: So I think that the seismic business will undoubtedly be affected, but there are two ways that it can be affected. The first way is that, if operators decide to slow programs, in which case it will be moderately affected, not catastrophically. The catastrophic scenario is they start going into M&A activity. So if my customers start buying each other, then they shut exploration down altogether for a year or so while they evaluate the portfolios and the re-decide what they're going to exploit and all the rest of it. So yes, there is a risk that exploration revenue in the next year goes much lower.  But I am now going to restate the caveat, and that is that the supply balance is extremely fragile. Nobody knows how deep the drop in demand is going to be, but there is a limit to the drop in demand unless we have a sort of worldwide depression that's going to last 10 years.  And to the extent that - Dave Anderson's first question - if they shut down worker activity, non-OPEC production is going to start sliding even faster than it is at the moment. And to the extent that they shut down exploration now, they are going to increase the reserve replacement problem that the customers already have, and I'm not just talking about IOCs, I'm talking about everybody.  So the extent that they actually shut everything down, which they may well do, the recovery is going to be all the stronger at the first sign that demand is picking up again.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  But if oil demand is flat for the next several years, how long a time do you think it will take until we're back in balance?
Andrew F. Gould: If oil demand is flat, not very long, 18 months, I would say.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International:  I was wondering if you could actually specify a little bit more, I mean, you talked about workover being the first sort of threshold of activity adjustment. Regionally speaking, what areas should we expect to see the first rates of adjustment in terms of spending growth to take place internationally?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, Bill, I hate to do this to you, but I'm not going to answer your question directly because I consider that as almost proprietary information. But it's not regionally, it's the type of customer you need to look at. So that's why North America is such a pure market, is because the customers rely on capital mechanisms to fund activity.  So, you know, then if you look across to the North Sea, there is a whole group of customers in the North Sea now who rely on capital markets to fund activity, and, as you know, there were a lot of small companies on the A market in London that grew up on the basis of funding from capital markets. It's a little bit true in some parts of the Far East, and it's certainly true on the West Coast of Africa today. But, you know, beyond that I really don't want to go into how I think the various NOCs or big guys are going to react.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Well, let me get this reaction from you. In the current environment, where we've had a retrenchment in oil prices and it's a much less certain macroeconomic environment, isn't it reasonable to expect really almost across the board, even from an NOC standpoint, that the sense of urgency just abates a bit at least?
Andrew F. Gould: I totally agree with you, but the reading of a sense of urgency will be different in function to the type of customer.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Next line of inquiry, North America. I mean, you know, I think you've been sort of consistently candid about the fact that we're in the Plan A and Plan B world here for a period of years.  And in the current environment, given the fact that we've already had such a significant collapse in, for example, pressure pumping pricing, and we've had an adjustment in general, lower with respect to pricing paradigm for North America oil services, in the event that we get, call it, I don't know, a 200 to 400 rig adjustment in the U.S., what should we expect with regard to your North America margins? I mean, they've already adjusted lower significantly. How much lower can they go from here? 
Andrew F. Gould: I don't, you know, it's a very difficult question to answer like that, Bill, but there's obviously, you know, in 500 - you said 500 rig drop?
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: No, I mean, pick a number; 500 is fine, but [inaudible] anywhere from 200 to 400 rigs relative to the recent peak.
Andrew F. Gould: Well, you know, initially they're going to drop quite a lot because - I don't know exactly how much because, you know, then you get all the people that Ole was just talking about going to work for the bank. You know? So, I mean, I don't want to give you a number because I don't know but you probably have to look back at our results. Do you remember what they went to '99, 2000, Simon?
Simon Ayat: No, I don't recall exactly.
Andrew F. Gould: The question though is - 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Well, but - 
Simon Ayat: The cost of operation is going to go down as well.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Yes, but I mean, I guess the difference is so - here's what I mean: We already had an adjustment here from your North American margins compressing from, call it, north of 30%, to in the low 20s. A lot of that came from pricing, and I'm just - you know, clearly absorption is going to get hurt with regard to an activity adjustment; some pricing as well. But I guess, you know, how severe will the rate of margin compression be in the event of a fairly meaningful pullback from this point forward? 
Andrew F. Gould: Look, I can't say more, Bill. It will still be severe and I don't know how much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: My question has to do with the Latin America region. Lat Am's sort of been an area of strength for many in the sector. It's a big IPM area, you noted in your release, and talked about the rising costs in the area. And you insinuated in your recent comments that peers have been bidding aggressively in these areas under IPM.  First could you talk about the sources of the inflation and then comment on the rising price competitiveness for IPM work relative to the cost issues? Actually, maybe throw into that also sorry to layer it on - you know, the financial needs or the ability to finance of the companies in that area, so what the step down in grown expectations from Lat Am region overall might be.
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think the step down due to lack of funding is going to be balanced against the production performance of many customers in that area, which means that they really can't afford to step down a great deal. I think that the inflation in the area is everything. It's materials as well as - particularly - as well as wages. And that will abate. I mean, it's quite obvious it's going to abate in some of the larger items right now, particularly in materials. Wages, I'm not so sure.  And I don't really want to comment any further than I've done in the past on the entry of other competitors into the IPM business in Latin America. Their pricing is one thing. Whether or not that affects the pricing of the overall IPM market depends how they perform.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: Are margins headed back towards the teens, though, in that region given all this mix of factors?
Andrew F. Gould: No, no, no. You must separate Mexico from everything else. If you're trying to use - read across from the IPM [inaudible] editors to overall margins in the region, no. And also, the other thing that is very necessary if you want to expand in IPM is a very strong balance sheet because there's a lot of upfront investment. 
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch:  Sure. An unrelated follow up and I won't layer on a bunch of details to this one, just in the Middle East you notice a change in mix and I just wondered if going forward are we seeing a change in activity overall in the Middle East that it's going to move toward this?
Andrew F. Gould: No. Listen, don't read across from this quarter's decline of 85 basis points or whatever it was. We have this every other quarter. I mean, it's just a shift in mix and, you know, we have no signs today - I'm not ruling out that we may have them in the next six months - but we have no signs today of a major shift in mix.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital.
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital:  Could you talk about, Andrew, opportunities for Schlumberger in the current credit crisis? And under your possible scenario of exploration revenue going much lower if we see widespread mergers in the oil industry, do you think this would lead to material consolidation in the Oil Service sector?
Andrew F. Gould: I don't think that an M&A amongst our customers would necessarily lead to a consolidation in the Oilfield Services sector. It is correct, I think, to assume that some of the startup or recently formed Marine seismic companies will get merged into other Marine seismic companies because they won't be able to survive at the size they are in a down market. But I don't think that necessarily reads a consolidation amongst our large customers and a drop in exploration spend means that the rest of the industry will feel the need to consolidate.  In terms of us, as I said in the analysts meeting in Houston in the Q&A, in this market in terms of what we might do and not do, we will be more opportunistic than we've been perhaps in the last two or three years.
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: And my one follow up is if activity in North America holds in relatively well here in the fourth quarter, do the discussions with your U.S. customers on one-year contract renewals, are they materially changed by the drop in natural gas prices and the credit crisis?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, you know, our customers are probably smart enough to know that if activity's going to go down they should delay the re-tendering until they think that they can see what activity's going to be. But I actually - I haven't any signs of that yet, Jim. I'm just saying what I think they would probably do.
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: And one last question. Can you give us your thoughts on the Russian market? And I noted one of the big customers announced half a billion to a billion dollar cut in their budget here for '09.
Andrew F. Gould: Which one was that, Jim?
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: BP TNK.
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, I - yes. I wouldn't make a read across to the whole industry from that. But, you know, in Russia we will have the same problem with small customers as we have in the United States, exactly the same, and the large ones, I don't know how all of them are going to react yet, but I very much doubt, given Russia's current production profile that they will go in for massive cuts straightaway.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup:  Andrew, I know you don't want to talk about areas of the world where you expect to slow down. That's proprietary and so forth. But in the past two downturns that you've lived through, the North Sea has been one. That's a high cost area that usually lead the way. And I just wondered if you would comment on what you're seeing in that market.
Andrew F. Gould: The only thing we've seen in that market so far is some very small startup companies or small new players who needed to call their credit lines have been delayed. That's the only thing we've seen so far, Robin.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: Let me just ask one other question, then, unrelated. Is there any inclination of the Board to reconsider the share buyback program in light of what's transpired with your stock price and where you've been buying stock? And also if you could comment on the outlook for capital spending in '09.
Andrew F. Gould: Well, so I think that on the buyback we will honor our commitment to not allow share creep. But until credit markets settle down and we have a clearer view of where we're going in '09, I don't think we will be doing much more than that. And in terms of the Capex for 2009, it's too early to say for all the reasons I've outlined to other callers, but obviously we are looking at - we have a six to nine-month cycle; we're basically talking about the Capex in the second half of 2009. And we will be looking at that very closely over the next couple of months.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Andrew, I wanted to clarify some of your comments. On one hand you said that the credit crisis and the credit issues are primarily a North American issue so far, and then you did go on to say though that overall you're anticipating a slowing in the rate of [break in audio]. Is that a Q4 versus '09 comment or I was just wondering if you could clarify that.
Andrew F. Gould: No, let me be totally clear. It is clear that the North America credit situation will have an effect on Q4 - not a huge effect, but an effect nonetheless. But when I talked about the credit crisis worldwide in '09, all I was saying is that it is going to have an effect, but we don't know what it is yet. And in fact the credit crisis, I think, by the time we get to '09 is going to be far less of a factor than what actually has happened to world oil demand because of the general economy.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities: And than an unrelated follow up. You addressed the cost inflation issues in Latin America, but more broadly, as things perhaps slow down a bit - and certainly we've seen commodity prices come in - would you expect your costs and the cost inflation to come in a little bit globally?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, absolutely. I think that it's going to be true for our customers, it's going to be true for us that a lot of the sort of really excessive inflation that we had is going to abate. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Doug Becker - Banc of America Securities.
Doug Becker - Banc of America Securities:  Andrew, I don't want to get too focused on semantics but I know you treat your words very carefully. Does your comment regarding a slowing in the rate of increase of customer spending imply that you still expect spending to be higher in 2009 versus 2008 as we sit here today?
Andrew F. Gould: As we sit here today, though I could be proved completely wrong in a week's time, that's what I meant, yes. But it's so dynamic that, you know, in two weeks time it could be completely different.
Doug Becker - Banc of America Securities: And then Capex guidance was lowered ever so modestly for Oilfield as well as WesternGeco. I don't want to read too much into it but was that a function of the outlook that you see or just the timing of the projects that are in queue. 
Andrew F. Gould: I would say it is our capacity to deliver coupled with a little bit of prudence, and actually - well, probably this year what we're doing is just slipping some of it into next year because, as we're on the six to nine-months cycle, we know what we're going to get. It's just a question of when you get it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.:  Andrew, my question's on Marine seismic and you've mentioned that your customers could slowdown there if it were a significant prolonged decline in prices. So, amongst that backdrop, recap your vessel delivery schedule from here and what of that is currently contracted as it's delivered, maybe what is your variability on changing the delivery, for instance, of some of the Eastern Echo vessels?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, next year we get two vessels in Q1 and then a vessel a quarter for the rest of the year. We're not anticipating any issues getting - some of them have contracts already. We don't yet see that getting the others contracts is a problem. And I think it will be difficult to delay shipyard delivery, but it would be possible, if the market gets really bad towards the end of next year, to mothball them rather than market them. We will probably [inaudible] and mothball old vessels and put the new ones into service.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: On the multi client sales, nice increase there in this quarter but obviously most of us concerned about what the future holds. You mentioned a large North American sale. Is that the majority of the sequential increase?
Andrew F. Gould: No, it's not the majority but it's a very large chunk, so we quite deliberately mentioned that to put you on notice, Pierre, that there was one very large chunk in it. But it's not the majority.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: Is there a component of library sales that are somewhat on a continuous basis, somebody that has a contract for a certain amount of sales, regularly or is it really completely variable? 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, there is a number of customers who have continuing multi client sales across a period of time. But don't forget there's always this year end Christmas shopping spree that takes place in the last five or six days of the year every year. And, you know, it's almost impossible to guess or to know how much that's really going to be.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: And then kind of unrelated but if I could, on some of these issues of what's contracted for the future, you addressed right on the first question right up the bat for the International. What about on the pressure pumping horsepower that is currently contracted for what duration for next year?
Andrew F. Gould: In North America, specifically?
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: Yes.
Andrew F. Gould: I don't know. I would probably imagine that about something like half is contracted now through the middle of next year. But, you know, in this market it's so dynamic that I could be completely wrong, Pierre.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.: And I understand contracted at price, but obviously activity depends on the customer.
Andrew F. Gould: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs.
Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs:  Most of my questions were answered so I just wanted to touch on one topic. You highlighted the establishment of a seismic data bank in Saudi to explore for natural gas. I was just wondering if you can give us some color on that, maybe timetables on when you think there could be some drilling activity out there for natural gas or when's the project going to be planned. Is that something we can be looking forward to as a potential positive offset down the road?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, I think that - we didn't discuss this in the context of - I have discussed this in the past, so I'm quite happy to discuss it now, but while I don't think you should relate it to the establishment of a national data bank in Saudi, it is true that the gas programs in the Middle East - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait - are very likely not to be affected by this because they are for domestic usage and in many cases to be substituted in place of oil that is currently used domestically. So I think the gas programs will be much less affected.
Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs: Can you just remind us on the timetables for those? Is that a '09 event or beyond?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, some are and some aren't. I mean, Oman is starting now a lot of the work. Saudi is probably '09. And the UAE, a lot of the UAE work is probably '09 as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co., LP.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co., LP:  Andrew, earlier in the call you said this is not 1998. Could you elaborate on what you meant by that?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I meant by that that there's a really positive factor and there's quite a negative factor. So the quite negative factor is we don't know how far demand is going to drop. And obviously the economic crisis is much more widely spread than it was in 1998 where, you know, basically it came out of Thailand or the Far East or Asia. So that's the, you know - so we don't know how far demand is going to drop. That's the slightly negative unknown. The positive is that the supply situation is much, much worse than it was in 1998. You know, I am very serious when I say that a decrease in exploration and production spending at this point is going to accelerate non-OPEC decline, which means that as soon as demand flattens or turns around, the price of oil is going to go right back up again.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP: And I guess you, I think with Ole you gave an answer in terms of 18 months we would be back in balance if - and that was - what conditions do you see oil - 
Andrew F. Gould: I'm saying that demand would stabilize some time in the first half of next year.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP: Okay, if demand stabilizes in the first half of next year, 18 months you would expect to see a rebalancing and I guess you mean upward direction in - 
Andrew F. Gould: You would see a tightening in supply/demand which would change the momentum of the price.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP: What if we had a scenario - if we had a scenario like the early 80s where actually we had three consecutive years of declining oil consumption, cumulatively something more than - well, roughly 10%. I mean, would that be, you know, I mean, do you see the supply situation being so fragile that we could get back into balance even in the context of that kind of demand decline?
Andrew F. Gould: No, I don't. But then I think you have - I must point out the differences between now and the early 80s. And the first is the level of interest rates. In other words, at the moment we don't have a desire to control inflation through interest rates in the world system and probably it's a good thing. The second thing is that the capacity for oil substitution in the developed economies in the early 1980s was huge. So, you know, a lot of that drop in the use of oil in the early 1980s or the mid 1980s was the substitution of other sources of power generation for oil. And today that just doesn't exist or it exists only to a much lower extent.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP: And my last question - you may or may not be willing to answer it - but what would you put the probability that Schlumberger's earnings in '09 are lower than they are in '08?
Andrew F. Gould: Personally, I don't know how to answer it and I'm not going to, Geoff.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brad Handler - Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  Just a couple of maybe sort of smaller picture follow ups, I guess. Can you comment on perhaps I don't know how to ask it exactly, but comment on multi client interest versus contract interest within WesternGeco? Is that somehow affected by all of the events that we're sort of thinking about currently?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think one has to have a clear policy on multi client. Our library is actually very small and we have had a very strong discipline of not shooting multi client unless the cost of it is prefunded to a certain percentage. And the danger with a seismic company in a downturn is that people will shoot multi client just to keep the boats active, and I think that it's incumbent on us to be extremely disciplined and not do too much of that.  So, you know, it's not really a question of just expanding the library for the sake of expanding the library. It's only expanding the library where you're sure you have a definite customer interest in what you're doing.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: Is it relative to your efforts to shift your library, I guess, and your customers' interest in shifting the library to rich azimuth? Does that impact kind of how much you expect to be able to do in '09? Do you expect that trend will remain fairly stable or your comment about - 
Andrew F. Gould: No, all indications at the moment are that - but it's early days - but all indications are that the '09 trend remains, for proprietary seismic, remains pretty positive at the moment. And a lot of that is to do with wide azimuth or rich azimuth, as you say.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: An unrelated follow up, please. You have helped us in the past by thinking about third-party content in IPM sort of on a quarterly basis.
Andrew F. Gould: Yes.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: Can you comment on what the fourth quarter outlook is?
Andrew F. Gould: Simon?
Simon Ayat: Well, this has remained the same. We are about the 40% to 50% azimuth frac this quarter because of what we mentioned of the startup of Burgos 7. It was a bit higher, meaning towards the 50%.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: So the outlook for the fourth quarter remains higher than - it remains in that 40% to 50% ban, which is higher than it has been in some quarters in '08, I think. Is that right?
Simon Ayat: Correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Gengaro - Jefferies & Co.
Stephen Gengaro - Jefferies & Co.:  Two seismic follow ups. The first: Is your sense that the more conservative accounting standards kind of across the board will help kind of overshooting a multi client in this cycle?
Andrew F. Gould: I don't know how to answer that, Stephen. I know that we, you know, at WesternGeco we have extremely strong guidelines in place not just on the accounting but on the approval of the prefunding in order to even start one. At other companies, I don't know whether there's been a big change in the way they account for multi client.
Stephen Gengaro - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, it seems like they have. But then as a follow up, can you give us a sense for your expectations, if you have any, for multi client investment in '09?
Andrew F. Gould: I don't think we have them. We haven't completed the planning cycle, so I would give you a wrong answer if I answered, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  If I could ask a quick question on M&A opportunities outside of North America, if the change in operating environment increases the opportunities. 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, it does, Michael. But as you know, there are not nearly so many, particularly for Schlumberger, targets outside North America that are very attractive, yes - attractive from a company strategy standpoint, I'm saying, not from a price standpoint. But yes there are, but far less than in the U.S. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  So if we look at distressed assets, probably the bigger market is still the U.S. 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan:  If we look at maybe technology sort of niche opportunities that are in need of capital, would they be more outside?
Andrew F. Gould: I would say they could be either in or out.
Operator:  Your last question comes from Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein.
Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein:  Andrew, given the low level of visibility you seem to have on 2009 EPS and cash [inaudible] share and the fact that we obviously have down oil and gas prices and a weak credit market, do you not think it's prudent here to be cutting Capex more aggressively in the expectation that the environment could possibly worsen further?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, as I've said on several occasions this morning, we have a six to nine-month cycle, so basically that means out of the six to nine months, 80% of that has already been ordered and therefore - we're not in a phase yet where our needs are so low that we start to cancel that. But beyond that we have not finalized a plan. But yes, obviously we're taking into account what we think the activity scenario is likely to be.
Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein: And just on a last macro question, you talked about the 1980s. In the 80s one of the things we'd seen was that the supply really turned out when the rigs and service capacity turned up. And we've seen in the gas market recently supply growth turn out when the [inaudible] of the service capacity's turned up. Do you think there's a genuine risk here that we get to 2009, 2010 and we have significantly more supply growth than most of us have estimated because that's when the capacity for services and rigs actually hits?
Andrew F. Gould: In oil?
Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein: Yes.
Andrew F. Gould: You're assuming that people keep spending?
Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein: Well, I'm assuming that margins drop and volume improves.
Andrew F. Gould: That's possible, but it's a long, long way from stabilizing. In other words, it's going to, you know, it's - the run up we've had in the last five years has been so inflationary that in fact if you relate the amount spent to the number of wells drilled, the activity increase has not been that huge.  Now to the extent that prices drop and that the customers spend more and activity increases, yes. But you're really talking about beyond 2010.
Malcolm Theobald: On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. 
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today.

Operator: Welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Malcolm Theobald: Welcome to today’s second quarter 2008 results conference call for Schlumberger Limited. Before we begin I’d like to review the logistics and format of the call. Some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our web site or upon request. And now for the call participants and format. Today’s call is being hosted from Paris where I am joined by both Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and also Simon Ayat, our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew’s overview of the second quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter’s financial results.  And now I’ll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat: Second quarter income from continuing operations was $1.16 per share up $0.10 sequentially and $0.14 above the same quarter of last year. Oilfield services second quarter revenue grew 8% sequentially reflecting strong growth in all geographical areas despite the impact of Canada’s spring break-up on North America. Outside of North America oilfield services revenue grew 11% sequentially. Oil technologies grew sequentially with IPM completions, this year’s testing SIS, and drilling and measurement are showing double-digit growth rates while WesternGeco was essentially fast for the first quarter. Oilfield services generated $1.7 billion in pre-tax operating income up $202 million from the first quarter with margins improving by 129 basis points to 28.1%. Outside North America operation margins improved by 218 basis points to 29.4%. By area, oilfield services highlights were as follows with comments on a sequential basis. North America pre-tax margin declined 167 basis points to 23.9% with improvements in the US land GecoMarkets which witnessed strong well services and one-line activities and in the US Gulf Coast which saw increased demand of high margin blending in measurements technologies were more than offset by the impact of the spring break-up in Canada. Without the impact of Canada, North America margins improved sequentially despite the continued increase in cost of operations. Latin America pre-tax margin rebounded by 296 basis points to 23% primarily due to increased demand for high margin technologies offshore in Mexico/Central America together with a more favorable activity mix in Brazil. In addition lower IPM project start-up costs on land in Mexico/Central America also contributed to this improvement. For ECA, the Europe/CIS/Africa area the pre-tax margin improved 181 basis points to 28.2%. The North Sea experienced a record quarter with high margin drilling and measurement technology is gaining from higher drilling activity and one-line benefitting from the drilling of high-pressure high-temperature wells. In addition the rebound of East Russia following the slowdown in the winter and the more favorable activity mix in West and South Africa GeoMarkets also contributed to this improvement. This performance was partially offset by operational delays in the Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea GeoMarkets. Middle East Asia pre-tax margin increased by 148 basis points to 36.3% most notably due to an increased demand for high margin wire line, drilling and measurement, and well services technologies in the China/Japan/Korea, Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, and Gulf GeoMarkets. This performance was also driven by a more favorable activity mix for exploration driven services in Australia and Thailand/Vietnam. However, these increases were partially offset by a slowdown in India and Qatar. WesternGeco pre-tax income was $196 million and a margin of 29.2% well in line with the previous quarter as improvements in land and data processing performance were partially offset by the impact of the market/client sales mix in North America. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 20.9% which was higher than last quarter due to the geographic mix of earnings in WesternGeco as well as the positive impact in the prior quarter of the favorable resolution of tax examination in a number of countries. The ETR is expected to be in the low 20s for the total year. The earnings for the quarter included $41 million of expenses relating to stock-based compensation and costs. Net debt was $2 billion at the end of the quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $555 million for a stock buy-back program, $1 billion of cap ex including $107 million of multi client surveys kept alive. During the quarter we bought back 5.45 million shares for $555 million at an average price of $101.90 per share. And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.
Andrew F. Gould : The strong sequential growth seen in the second quarter throughout the Eastern Hemisphere led to the improved performance in all areas except North America where the effects of strong growth in the lower 48 states and the US Gulf of Mexico was more than offset by a prolonged spring break-up in Canada. Growth was helped by increased drilling efficiency in the North Sea, improved performance and lower mobilization costs on IPM projects in Mexico and Russia, and a favorable expiration mix particularly in the North Sea, Eastern Siberia, and Southeast Asia. The quarter also saw increased demand for well placement technologies and rigless work as operators strived to increase production from existing fields. Looking at the areas in more detail, the Lewis Land GeoMarkets in North America reported strong revenue increases driven by a robust demand for well services and wire line technologies in addition to a rebound in activity following the end of the seasonal winter weather restrictions. Offshore the US Gulf Coast also registered strong growth through demand for drilling and measurement services and a surge in completion product sales. These increases were largely offset by the seasonal slowdown in Canada. In Latin America sequential revenue growth was strong across the area led by Mexico/Central America GeoMarket due to the ramp up of IPM projects as well as the higher offshore activity. Peru/Colombia/Ecuador saw significant improvements due to the higher demand for wire line and drilling and measurements technologies together with increased gain share of an IPM activity in Colombia while the Venezuela/Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarkets benefitted from strong demand for well services and wire line technologies. In the Brazil GeoMarket growth was driven by higher expiration activity and increased SIS product sales. The Argentina/Bolivia/Chile GeoMarket improved on strong demand for well services and wire line technologies; however, growth was partially offset by operational delays in Argentina. Sequential revenue growth in Europe/CIS/Africa was driven primarily by demand for all technologies across the North Seas GeoMarket particularly by drilling and measurement and high-pressure high-temperature wire line services. Strong activity for all technologies in West and Southern Africa together with increased demand for expiration related activities in East Russia also contributed to growth. In the Middle East Asia area sequential revenue growth was led by the Arabian GeoMarket with high demand for well services and testing services technologies together with increased completion system product sales. The China/Japan/Korea GeoMarket experienced a robust rebound in activity following the winter slowdown in the first quarter while Australia/Papua New Guinea grew on increased offshore expiration activity that resulted in strong demand for wire line and drilling and measurement services. Growth was also recorded from expiration related wire line services in the Thailand/Vietnam and from wire line and well services technologies and SIS product sales in the Gulf GeoMarket. Well service technologies and artificial lift products were particularly strong in Indonesia. Activity declines in India and Qatar partially offset these positive factors. Oilfield services bidding activity during the quarter was strong particularly for drilling and measurements, wire line and testing services. This led to a number of significant contract awards particularly in the area of drilling services where advances in rotary-steerable systems and well placement technologies coupled with increased reliability are critical to operators in today’s environment of very high-spread costs for offshore rigs. Our WesternGeco sequential revenue is essentially flat but increases in multi client sales and data processing were offset by the seasonal drop in marine activity. Significant increases were recorded in the backlog for land operations while marine contract bidding activity remained robust. Newly awarded activity included a contract in Indonesia for the proprietary WesternGeco coil shooting as a [azimuthal] acquisition technique that uses a single Q-marine vessel to acquire [azimuthal] data thus significantly increasing operational efficiency. Also a contract in Kuwait for the largest Q-land acquisition and processing contract ever won that is expected to last for two years. Turning now to other events, we made a number of acquisitions during the quarter that increased our capabilities or added specific technologies to our portfolio. In Canada shareholders of Saxon Drilling voted to accept the Schlumberger offer made jointly with First Reserve Capital to acquire the company. Schlumberger has enjoyed a long association with Saxon which has included operating joint ventures in Mexico and Colombia that deliver drilling services to support integrative project management activities. Also in Canada we acquired the business of Extreme Engineering Limited a leading supplier of unmanned MWD systems to land markets in the US and Canada. This acquisition will help facilitate the rapid uptake of rotary-steerable systems technology in these highly cost-sensitive drilling environments. Other technology acquisitions included integrated expiration systems, a Germany-based technology leader in petroleum systems modeling, Staag Imaging a Houston-based provider of leading edge imaging technologies for seismic data processing. Both these acquisitions add further strength to our seismic offering in an expiration market where we expect to see more and more demand for technology integration. At the beginning of the year we predicted a more complex growth pattern for 2008. Notably we were uncertain of the evolution of North American natural gas activity and the extent to which delays in the completion of new built offshore rigs would affect growth. We anticipated solid increases in the Eastern Hemisphere land rig count. But at half year the uncertainty around the direction of natural gas drilling in North America has been removed and extremely high commodity prices have led operators to increase their budgets overseas. We anticipate that approximately 35 new offshore rigs will enter the fleet in the remaining half of the year. The overseas land rig count has evolved much as we predicted. It appears that customers are responding vigorously to the current commodity price levels. Inflationary pressures particularly for certain commodity supplies and some categories of personnel are increasing worldwide but particularly in North America where the rapid ramp up in activity is exaggerating the trend. Improved pricing will be key to further investment in some markets. In the longer term we remain convinced that absence in deep worldwide recession leading to a steep in demand, higher levels of investment will have to be sustained to bring some equilibrium to the market. We therefore reiterate our stronger for longer view of the current cycle of expiration and production spending. It is significant that during the quarter an additional 28 new offshore rigs were reported ordered from shipyards with delivery dates out to 2012 increasing the total on order to more than 180. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.
Malcolm Theobald: We will now open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Andrew, how much conviction do you have in North America beyond year end given the rapid increase in production and do you think you’ll be able to book some net pricing gains across all your product lines before the end of the year?
Andrew F. Gould : I actually haven’t even tried to make myself a full conviction on 2009. I think it’s too early. I think that there is some pricing power going forward in the stock market and I think that how much pricing power we have in the big contract cycle towards the end of the year is going to depend on the view of 2009. But I think it’s a bit early for me to; I would be dishonest if I said I thought I knew what was going to happen in 2009 yet.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: On the international you state in your comments that you’re seeing a ramp in international E&P spend, so would you be comfortable with international revenue growth in the mid 20s for 2009?
Andrew F. Gould : I have no reason to believe that it won’t be above 20% but don’t try and tie me down further than that.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: In terms of the geographics from higher to lower, how do you think the geographic markets will rank in growth?
Andrew F. Gould : Well I think in 2008 Latin America will be the star and 2009 actually I think it’s going to be very much influenced by the arrival of a lot of the offshore rigs which is North Seas, West Africa, Gulf of Mexico and to some extent Brazil. And on land I actually think that Russia will be very strong again.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Cap ex at the beginning of the year you highlighted at that point in time was 13% and we felt at the time the conference call was made that it was low. Now you’re going up to 29% year-over-year which seems to say very confident tone for how you see your business. Could you talk a little bit about exactly what product line, what regions that you have grown more confident on to have this type of a cap ex increase relative to the beginning of the year?
Andrew F. Gould : I would say the beginning of the year cap ex was very much orientated to how we saw the evolution of the offshore rig fleet. But what is coming in supplemental now is probably the big increases in land activity that we had not foreseen, and actually it’s being affected by some of the contract wins we’ve had.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley:  Anything there on the product line? More exploration? More development?
Andrew F. Gould : I think the bulk of our cap ex is the four big ones, so it’s wire line, drill and measurements, testing, and well services.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Are we seeing the biggest price increases in anything to do with metals whether it’s [inaudible] TG or drill pipe? I would imagine that other form of products like completion or rental tools or anything to do with the metal in the well work could be getting some pricing. How do you see those segments of the market now?
Andrew F. Gould : I mean you have to remember that in most of our tools we’re using specialty alloys. We’re not using - the steels are they type one uses in drill pipe or casing. So the price increases in specialty alloys are horrible. Look at chrome 25 and stuff like that, the price has doubled. But there’s not an availability issue. So there is a cost issue but not an availability issue in the alloys that we use mostly.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So you have the ability to raise prices to compensate for this?
Andrew F. Gould : So far it’s too early to say definitively that it’s okay but it’s going quite well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: Andrew, I need a little bit of perspective here and speaking boldly about international margins, they were nicely improved this quarter. But going forward, reconcile the tension for me between on the one hand increasing drilling and technological intensity and rising offshore content with an environment in which is still fairly competitive on these bigger projects and some of these projects are being won, not necessarily from you, with sort of seemingly start pricing and bids, and also cost inflation seems to be relatively be unabated. So given all those elements, where do margins go from here internationally?
Andrew F. Gould : I think if people want to maintain or increase their international margins, they’re going to have to pay attention to inflation particularly in any sort of project that requires a great deal of third party supplies. In a technology sense of projects, big offshore drilling or stuff like that, I think that the operators spread cost of rigs is so huge compared to the marginal increase in pricing that we need that it’s not a big issue. Reliability is becoming more important every day. So I don’t think that people will win very large offshore drilling projects on price necessarily.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: So specifically, do you expect international margins to continue improving?
Andrew F. Gould : I said at the beginning of the year that it will be lumpy. So in a quarter where we have really good exploration activity and really strong drilling activity like this quarter, there’s no doubt that margins can increase. In a quarter where you have seasonal weather in the North Sea or China shuts down for the winter, then you probably have margin decline. So I don’t think there’s going to be a constant linear increase over quarters but on an annual basis provided the exploration holds up, I don’t see why we shouldn’t still have some room to run.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: The follow up here with regard to North American pressure pumping, I was wondering as to how successful you were in the second quarter and how successful you are on a leading edge basis with respect to getting fuel surcharges implemented and cost inflation as it relates to fuel addressed?
Andrew F. Gould : For fuel surcharges we are more than reasonably successful.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: North American margins came down relatively sharply quarter-on-quarter largely due to Canada.
Andrew F. Gould : No, no. As Simon said at the beginning of his thing, North American GeoMarket margins increased in every GeoMarket except Canada but the effect of the long break-up was such that that nullified the effect of the global North America level.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners.
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Andrew, I just want to make sure I understand your commentary around the international operators. You said a vigorous response. That combined with kind of the 20+%, I think you had been talking about high teens international growth rates. It does sound like internationally clearly has picked up within the last two-three-four months.
Andrew F. Gould : I was surprised, as I think we all were, by the strength of the rebound coming out of the winter so part of that was just the normal huge pick up in drilling efficiencies in the North Sea, stuff like that, but part of it was a real effort to where people could increase activity particularly on land where as you know it’s much easier to increase activity than offshore. But we were surprised by the strength of the rebound.
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Could you generally comment, your joint venture partner in MI is now in the directional drilling business, Smith Klein WHQ. How does that affect your thinking about the MI joint venture going forward and what are the mechanics associated with that JV?
Andrew F. Gould : I’m not quite sure what you mean by the mechanics Dan, but MI is and I hope will remain a very strong partner. There will be competitive situations which will be quite difficult to manage but they’re not very common and I don’t’ see any reason why we shouldn’t continue to enjoy a good material relationship with MI.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: First, Andrew I was struck by the comment in the press release concerning the continental resources with the shale job. I was wondering, you’ve talked in the past about the technological evolution within the North American pumping business and it feels like reading that comment here in press releases or seeing press releases from operators talking about an 11 or 12 stage frac, etc. that there’s perhaps more of a technological revolution going on in that business. Can you talk about the pace of sort of technology uptake and what that could mean for margins just beyond pure pricing?
Andrew F. Gould : Actually Mike I think that like any new play, operators will not pay for technology until they understand what it can do for them and now we’re getting to the stage in shale gas where a combination of horizontal wells and stage fracturing together with this capacity that we have to monitor fracs in real time. And it’s very different. If you monitor it and then just give the result to the customer afterwards, it’s what we call internally a “so what service.” “You told me what you did but you can’t do anything about it.” If you do it in real time, it allows you to start to look at modifying the engineering of the frac as you’re performing it which is really quite important. So I think there’s no common, not just Schlumberger by the way but the leading players in pressure pumping are now getting to the stage where there is some differentiation in what they can do. And to a certain extent in a tight market that will reflect well in pricing. In a very slow market it will allow them to maintain pricing. But there’s absolutely no doubt that the technology of contact, reservoir contact or contact with well bore is improving fairly dramatically at the moment.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: How would you characterize the uptake today versus what you might have thought 12 months ago?
Andrew F. Gould : It suddenly accelerated. I mean, 12 months ago we were experimenting with a lot of this stuff but it’s now I think accelerating. I think our issue is going to be providing it.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Second question, a lot of discussion on mix internationally, obviously a shift towards exploration helpful. Are you seeing a discernible difference in the oil/natural gas mix on the exploration side given the tightness in the global gas market?
Andrew F. Gould : Regionally yes. In other words there is a lot of gas exploration in the Middle East for example. Globally I would say it’s still reasonably balanced between oil and gas. What we are seeing more and more is that as you point out, the shortage of worldwide gas means that people are starting to look at unconventional sources of natural gas overseas which is something we thought would come much later. You must have seen some of these deals in Australia where operators are going after coal-bed methane for example even to feed [LNG] sometimes. So this is really very different.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Pretty massive. And if I understand it correctly, the revenue process for rigs and process for rigs in international gas is even greater than the difference in North America. 
Andrew F. Gould : In the big [LNG] projects, that’s undoubtedly the gas. The point being that most of the development have penalties attached to late delivery of the gas and therefore execution of the development projects is key.
Operator:  Our next question is from Charles Minervino – Goldman Sachs.
Charles Minervino – Goldman Sachs: I just wanted to talk a little bit about in your comments in the press release and your comments this morning you talked about rig list work a number of time and I was just wondering if you could give us a percentage of your total revenue is rig list and how those margins kind of stack up a little just to the overall business.
Andrew F. Gould : What I don’t know is the honest answer today because it varies very much by country by country and area by area. When we have campaigns of rig list work the margins, they’re really very good because we normally get to control the execution which means we can be extremely efficient in the use of our resources. So, we mentioned for example one or two contracts in the press release where we have 300 wells to do. If we control the logistics on that the margins are very good.
Charles Minervino – Goldman Sachs: Then I guess in Latin America on margins typically, and it looks like you’re getting closer to those peak levels you reached in 2007, is it safe to say that the startup costs in Mexico are pretty much behind the company at this point? And, could you see margins potentially go higher in Latin America as those Mexico costs are completely wound out? 
Andrew F. Gould : Actually, I think the margins in Latin America were obviously, less the startup costs now, will be driven by the drilling performance. We still have room to improve there so to the extent that we improve margins would improve. But, I would also say that in Latin America there is the same shift as everywhere else towards more drilling, particularly of expiration wells and therefore the actual revenue mix is going to improve, not just IPM. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch.
Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch: A question on the directional drilling side, direction drilling continues to be a freestyle product line for a number of years here globally and you’ve recently made a small penny in directional acquisition. Could you comment on maybe how tight the directional drilling market is today? And, more specifically, maybe how you see the North American market for directional services in the context I guess of higher directional rig count and then a rising rig count?
Andrew F. Gould : Well, I think that if you watch the rate of growth in the horizontal rig count in the US competitive oil directional rig count, for all sorts of different reasons, be they geological reasons or be they infrastructure reasons, there’s no doubt that directional drilling will go on increasing. But, directional drilling in North America has to be provided at a cost that is effective otherwise it’s not going to grow the way it should be. So, our purchase of Extreme Engineering brings us a service where we can use NWD without manning it probably by monitoring it from a centralized drilling center. So, we still think it has, in the land market both in the US and overseas, a long way to run.
Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch: When you look at that as a growth driver, how are you assessing that for Schlumberger? Are you looking at is as more investing in maybe the lower end directional tools? Or, is this an acquisition [inaudible].
Andrew F. Gould : No, we could have built one ourselves but the fact is that Extreme Engineering is the company that was originally funded by Shell with technology from Shell and the decision of having it available through buying the company rather than developing our own became clearly obvious because of the rate of growth in the market.
Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch: Last question will be on the bit side, you talked about wanting back in the bits business. Can you talk a little bit about, no pun intended there, about strategic thinking behind this and what aspects of the product line that are most important to you?
Andrew F. Gould : Well, access to bit technology because of the interface between bit technology and the BHA and the steering capability. So, yeah we need access to bit technology, you don’t necessarily need to own a bit company.
Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch: So when you’re planning to address this desire is it more through joint venture or technology sharing?
Andrew F. Gould : Well, we actually do own a small bit company where we can build our own prototype and we would probably like to have the manufacturing of those prototypes under license with one of the existing bit companies. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers.
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers: Andrew, would you expect your seismic results in the second half to comfortably exceed those of the second half of 2007?
Andrew F. Gould : I would expect them to comfortably exceed the first half of 2008 and yes, we think they would comfortably exceed the first second half of 2007. 
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers: Then I just have two questions about two specific contracts. You mentioned that people will not win these big offshore contracts on price. I wanted you to comment on Intec’s big win down on the Petrobras work down in Brazil, what you make of that? And then secondly, I wanted to ask you about Chicontepec area in Mexico, Weatherford obviously bidding less on APG-1 and APGI-2 than you bid on Chicontepec-3 and whether you think you’ll have to bring your prices down on future Chicontepec work?
Andrew F. Gould : Well, I don’t like commenting on competition’s pricing policy Jim. I don’t think Intec is a good competitor. I don’t think that their Brazil win was on price. And, Chicontepec you know, all I can say is that the big companies bid roughly the same price and somebody bid very low and I wish them the best of luck in execution. 
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers: But, would you think that would impact your prices that you would have to work for Pemex in the future?
Andrew F. Gould : It depends on how well they execute.
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers: So if they execute well and they continue, you would think that Pemex would come to you and expect you to lower your price.
Andrew F. Gould : Then, in future bidding rounds prices would definitely go lower, yes.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank.
Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank: A couple of regional questions, the first one is on Russia, you’ve had some favorable and some improvement in the upstream tax regime there. How quickly do you think that will translate in to [taxtivity] improvements in Russia?
Andrew F. Gould : A little bit at the end of this year but much more next year.
Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank: So an 09 event for them?
Andrew F. Gould : Yes.
Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank: Second one is in Saudi where you had spoken about activity levels in Saudi kind of leveling off here over the next year, 18 months or so. Given the rapid increase in the oil price we’ve seen and some of the comments out of the Saudi themselves in terms of potentially once again taking up their capacity has your view on that changed at all?
Andrew F. Gould : Not for oil, for gas yes. In other words, the Saudis I think will probably undertake some major gas development programs inside the kingdom. But, not for oil.
Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank: So oil kind of leveling off, gas rising so on average and in the aggregate I guess and continued increases in activity on Saudi?
Andrew F. Gould : Yes.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co., LP.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co., LP: I want to come back because I’m trying to connect the dots Andrew in terms of the big increase in the cap ex. You talked in the press release about the strong bidding activity but it seems like that comment was tied to offshore and you said in the press release that the international land business is developing as expected but then in some of the other responses to questions it seemed like it was the international land that was driving the big increase in cap ex. So, can you help us understand that a little bit?
Andrew F. Gould : Well, I was answering the question in function of what Ole asked us on how we planned our cap ex for 2008. And, actually 2008 we plan the actual cap ex pretty much but we expected land to respond, we didn’t expect the US to respond and therefore globally on land we need more cap ex.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co., LP: Is the international land also stronger than you had expected?
Andrew F. Gould : In some places, yes. Okay, no, generally yes Geoff, generally yes. It’s not dramatically stronger expect in the US. But, generally it’s a bit stronger than we probably originally anticipated.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co., LP: The size of the cap ex increase would suggest that you have confidence in that continuing in to 09 I’m inferring?
Andrew F. Gould : And, as I mentioned, we have had some contract wins which means we’ve had to revise some of the numbers for offshore as well.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co., LP: Second question, you said that the development of unconventional resources internationally was progressing more quickly than you expected. Does that raise the prospect of frac capacity issues immerging internationally over the next year or two? 
Andrew F. Gould : I think we’ve known for some time that the growth in the frac market overseas is going to be much stronger than people would have imagined two or three years ago. So, I’m not sure whether that produces a capacity crunch or not because it depends so much on North America.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co., LP: The nature of the capacity required for the international projects in terms of the equipment, the technology type, is it similar to what’s used in North America?
Andrew F. Gould : Except you don’t have the same logistics therefore you need a lot more support than you do in North America.
Operator:  Our next question is from Douglas Becker – Banc of America.
Douglas Becker – Banc of America: Andrew, I just wanted to touch base on third party revenues for IPM. The first quarter release talked about third party accounting for about 35% of IPM revenues during full year 2008. The first half has been running somewhere between 33% and 34% implying a big pickup in the second half of the year. Is that still the case or has something changed there?
Andrew F. Gould : I’m going to ask Simon to answer that if that’s okay.
Simon Ayat : I mean it depends on the area, overall what you’ve seen is its 34%. This is the current level of third party revenue IPM. As we go forward and the projects ramp up is increasing we will see an increase in the third party. For example, in Mexico obviously it is more than 34%. But, as you see the project ramp up increasing in the future we’re going to see this percentage slightly increasing but not significantly.
Douglas Becker – Banc of America: So it sounds like the 45% for full year 2008 is a little high?
Simon Ayat : It could be high because we are increasing IPM revenue in other places where the third party is less significant than what we have in the Mexico market.
Douglas Becker – Banc of America: And just based on previous commentary it suggests that even with third party revenue increasing in Latin America, specifically Mexico, that margins can still be expanding?
Simon Ayat : Two elements in Latin America increased the margin this quarter was the less startup as Andrew mentioned and as we mature in to projects, also as Andrew mentioned, and the efficiency increases, the margins increase.
Operator:  Our next question is from David Anderson – UBS Securities.
David Anderson – UBS Securities: Also kind of an IPM related question here, how big do you think the IPM market is from your standpoint on an annual revenue basis? In other words, what is your annual revenue opportunity that you are going after and how do you expect to see this evolve over the next several years?
Andrew F. Gould : David, we don’t look at it on that basis, we look at it on a project basis so we don’t pre-calculate a revenue target that we’re aiming for. We actually keep a portfolio of projects that we’re going after and normally apart from Mexico where the market is mature, the sales cycle is two to three years. So, actually, I don’t even want to disclose a number because it will only encourage my friends in other places. Talking about my friends, I have to issue an apology to my friends at Baker. Apparently I said Intec is not a good competitor when I was answering a question on Brazil. I of course meant that Intec is a good competitor which is why I don’t think they want it on press.
David Anderson – UBS Securities: I guess one other question I have for you there is you mentioned some time ago you had about $5 billion in IPM backlog, do you care to tells us out there what the number is now?
Simon Ayat : It hasn’t changed very much.
David Anderson – UBS Securities: Then you also mentioned on Russia you were much more confident on the activity increasing in Russia next year. Is that because of IPM work coming through or do you see something else out there?
Simon Ayat : It’s Russia going forward will be a mixture of IPM and service contracts.
David Anderson – UBS Securities: So do you have confidence that the government is going to be lowering the taxes to a point that’s going to spur more activity?
Simon Ayat : Yes.
David Anderson – UBS Securities: I guess on a different related topic, on new build. If you see the deep water new build, deep level water well runs around $100 million or so in total costs how much work of that is potentially Schlumberger? 
Simon Ayat : Well potentially it’s our four big product lines, so it’s oil lines, well services, drilling and measurements and testing. Please don’t ask me for a number because a huge amount depends on whether that well is dry or if it has a find. The actual scope of the revenue could change by a factor of two or three in function of whether or not the will finds anything or doesn’t find anything.
David Anderson – UBS Securities: When you were talking about your cap ex before, I assume a big chunk of that is going to building out rotary steerable in anticipation of this new drilling and measurements.
Simon Ayat : I think actually there is another in drilling and measurements and that is that with rig’s spread cost at 1.2 double a day rate, so $1.2 million a day, people don’t fish for stock tools very much, they just cement them in and sidetrack which means that the build out of cap ex has to be adjusted for that.
David Anderson – UBS Securities: My last question, just on rotary steerable, when you talked about your cap ex before, I assume a big chunk of your cap ex is going to building out rotary steerable based on the new build surge. Can you quantify it? Can you quantify for us how much capacity is expected to increase year-over-year in rotary steerable?
Simon Ayat : We’d rather not. I’m sorry, I’d rather no.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: Andrew, just on this – you’ve mentioned several times on the call the number of offshore rigs being delivered in the next few years, how far along are we either on the 35 rigs delivered this year or the 180 in terms of allocating contracts for oil field services on those new rigs and kind of what’s your strategy to maximize your presence on each of those new rigs?
Andrew F. Gould : First I would like to point out that the 35 this year are very much loaded on Q4. It may actually slip some in to 09. So, if the equipment has to be bolted down, so cementing units or pumps or some of the testing spread, then the contracts will tend to get allocated, or at least the contracts for the equipment at the time of the build. For oil line drilling and measurements and testing services, I would say that probably about half the contracted rigs have already awarded those contracts. And, the reason they’ve awarded them is very often because they’re operator contracts particularly for exploration rigs that are going to move from country to country. If they tend to be in very mature fields of operation like a North Sea or Gulf of Mexico, they may come under existing contract or they will get bid much closer to the time.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: If we compare the business, how are you doing on the new builds compared to the existing fleet of the offshore rigs and your market share and various product lines? Do you believe that on the new rigs your market share is same, or better, or worse?
Simon Ayat :
Andrew F. Gould : So far I think it’s the same and we’ll see where it goes going forward.
Operator:  Our next question is from Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak & Co.
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak & Co.: A couple of questions, one I guess just some clarification on Russia. Andrew, could you quantify year-on-year revenue growth in Russia relative to end margins, relative to change, relative to the rest of the broader segment? I guess I was expecting slower Russia.
Andrew F. Gould : I think in the first half of the year it probably exceed the average of the rest of continental Europe, Europe Africa unit. But, don’t forget that we still have the effect of an acquisition in the first half of the year so it will probably slow a bit in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year. But, through the effect of the acquisition not through the effect of lack of activity.
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak & Co.: We’ve been hearing some pain from some of the smaller competitors in the frac business there. Did you feel the same?
Andrew F. Gould : The frac business has been tough particularly in the south for the first half of the year. There was over capacity. 
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak & Co.: Did that bring Russia’s margins down for you overall?
Andrew F. Gould : Not overall, no.
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak & Co.: Then just quickly I wanted to switch to North America. You were reluctant to reach out on an 09 forecast that Kurt was fishing for. Your customers all seem to be raising budgets, raising capital, you know pretty positive outlooks for 09 so is the reluctance just a function of the volatility in the market and the risk of gas prices? Or, it’s just too early to make a call?
Andrew F. Gould : It’s just too early. I’ve been reputed to making too early calls on North America so I thought this time I would wait a bit Kevin. I don’t know. If you like, it’s more a function of what Kurt said which is the very substantial increases in production we’re seeing and then you know you have to take in to account the summer, the weather and all the rest of it and how much is the current oil prices affecting gas consumption. The fact is that [inaudible] is going to the states, there are so many factors in it now that it is quite difficult to make a longer term call. 
Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak & Co.: In terms of allocating capital then you don’t really have to make a decision yet?
Andrew F. Gould : No, we’ve got our cycle down to a level where we can make the allocation much later.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Robert MacKenzie – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
Robert MacKenzie – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Andrew, I wanted to step back and address the stimulation of the Shell reservoirs more from a mechanical standpoint and try and get some idea. One of the things I’ve heard about that is being done recently is what someone called zipper frac to me whereby you offset the placement of the fracs in the adjacent well bore so that you can create an oblique stress field. How much do you think that has potential to raise productivity something like the [barneck]? Is that something that can help take the fraction from 3 million to 5 million a day along with other advancements.
Andrew F. Gould : I have to tell you, I just don’t know. What I will tell you is that in producing Shell gas reservoirs fewer mechanics is fundamental. In some ways it is more fundamental than petro physics. You know, I am sure that there are lots of ideas going around about how you could alter stress fields in such a way as to release the gas but the fact is one of our top scientists spent some time looking at this recently and said one of the biggest issues with Shell gas is that nobody actually knows what the production mechanism is. So, you may well be right, I don’t know. What I do know is that there still is a lot of work to be done on how these production mechanisms actually work.
Robert MacKenzie – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: A follow up, I was wondering if you could share with us what you do know on how the shale oil production mechanism works say in the Bakken Shale. That’s still kind of a mystery to me. I was wondering if you could just kind of shed some light on that.
Simon Ayat : The shale oil in the Bakken? I don’t know. I am aware of the different technologies that some of the majors are working on for the production of shale oil but I honestly haven’t had a discussion of this in the context of the Bakken. But, what I will do is get Malcolm to find out and give you a call, okay.
Operator:  Our next question is from Pierre Conner – Capital One.
Pierre Conner – Capital One: Andrew, you’ve addressed the capital changes on oil field services and I wondered if you could speak a little bit on reconciling your change in outlook on cap ex for WesternGeco both related to the construction on Eastern Echo vessels and also the change on the expected cap ex from multi client? What’s sort of driving that?
Andrew F. Gould : So, there is no underlying change in our philosophy on the construction of the vessels. We have one vessel that is delayed about four months which was suppose to come around about now but is not coming until the end of the year. But, the Eastern Echo vessels seem to be pretty much on schedule and therefore there is no change in the level of cap ex. Multi client, we have seen in the last quarter some improvement on pre-funding levels therefore – 
Pierre Conner – Capital One: Less cap ex.
Andrew F. Gould : I think we’ve increased slightly our budget but really it’s marginal. So, I would say that compared to what we showed you at the end of the first quarter, there’s really no substantial change.
Pierre Conner – Capital One: Now, you mentioned that marine bidding was robust, can we read through there that there’s still pricing power? 
Andrew F. Gould : In certain segments of the marine market there’s still pricing power, yes. 
Pierre Conner – Capital One: My follow up is again to try again sort of Kevin and Kurt on North America. But, I’m assuming that when you roll in North America that’s inclusive, your conviction improvement is inclusive of Canada as well, is that correct?
Andrew F. Gould : Yes.
Pierre Conner – Capital One: And maybe a different way to ask would be, do you know of a commodity price level? Rather, we all have many variables in front of us, weather, summer, etc. but, what is this increase from your customer perspective due to the price increase, not just new developments?
Andrew F. Gould : You mean our price increases?
Pierre Conner – Capital One: No, I’m sorry, the commodity price increase?
Andrew F. Gould : I think at current levels it’s just fine. I mean there is some guarantee of future activity to the extent to which our customers have hedged their forward production. I certainly think that production drops in Canada will mean that it will be a very healthy Canada through the rest of this year and the first quarter of next year. I’m just not prepared to take a definitive position on the whole of North America land for next year yet. I just don’t feel comfortable doing it, sorry.
Operator:  Our final question comes from Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch.
Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch: I just had a quick high level follow up question on growth. When you look at what is the most important trends for Schlumberger over the next few years, if you looked at rise of exploration or expansion of the offshore recount, or the increasing well complexity or architecture, or then just straight out IPM, what would be the number one driver?
Andrew F. Gould : Well I actually think there are probably two drivers. I’m thinking three to five years now, okay? The first driver has to be the extent to which there is a real effort to renew the reserve base and therefore exploration which will largely be either offshore or in harsh environments. But, as I mentioned in answer to I think it was Michael’s question earlier, the current gas situation is such that a lot of gas exploration that was not planned two or three years ago is going to happen. So, the first is exploration. The second is, and I said this before and I’ll say it again, is that the secret to stemming decline curves is number one you have to drill and number two you have to increase the amount of reservoir contact. So, the service intensity around stemming the decline curve would have to increase fairly dramatically if people are serious about it. And actually, I think that’s a little bit what we saw in Q2 with the extremely high commodity price. 
Malcolm Theobald :  On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today’s call. Julie will now provide the closing comments.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations for Schlumberger Limited, Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir. 
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Gail. Welcome to today’s first quarter 2008 results conference call for Schlumberger Limited. Before we begin, I would like to review the logistics and format of today’s call.  Some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request.  And now for the call participants and format; joining the call from New Delhi, India are both Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew’s overview of the first quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter’s financial results.  And now I’ll turn the call over to Simon. 
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter income from continuing operations was $1.06 per share, down $0.05 sequentially and $0.10 above the same quarter of last year. An additional $0.03 gain was reported in discontinued operations.  Oilfield services first quarter revenue grew 3% sequentially, reflecting growth in North America and Europe/CIS/Africa areas. The seasonal year end strength in artificial lift and completions equipment sales, as well as SIS software sales reverted to normal levels in Q1 while traditional service segments, such as wireline, drilling and measurement, and well services showed sequential growth. WesternGeco reported weak multi-client sales only partly offset by an improvement in marine activity.  Oilfield services generated $1.5 billion in pretax operating income, down $33 million from the fourth quarter of last year but margins declined by 140 basis points to 26.8%.  By area, oilfield services highlights were as follows. My comments are on a sequential basis.  North America pretax margin improved 21 basis points to 25.6%, with strong seasonal activity in Canada and Alaska, augmented by full recovery in the Gulf Coast with the return of deepwater rigs, more than offsetting land access operational restriction in the Rockies, winter weather in the U.S. north, and pricing deterioration for well stimulation related services in the U.S. central market.  Latin America pretax margin declined by 203 basis points to 20.1%. In Mexico, IPM project [Recount] continued to grow with more activity but increased levels of project start-up costs and a high proportion of third-party managed services impacted our margins negatively. Reduced activity and the less favorable revenue mix due to project delays in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil geomarkets also reduced margins.  For ECA, the Europe/CIS/Africa area, the pretax margin declined 163 basis points to 26.3%, as Russia exhibited the seasonal slowdown off-shore cycling and incurred the start-up costs for several new projects while operational delays in the North Sea hampered drilling and measurement activity.  Strong activity was reported in the West Africa, Caspian, and Continental Europe geomarkets. The area included the consolidation of FRAMO for the first time.  Middle East/Asia pretax margin declined by 10 basis points to 34.9%. While the year-end high level of artificial lift and completions equipment sales, particularly in the Arabian geomarket was not repeated, exploration driven improvements in the Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, East Mediterranean and Gulf geomarkets more than offset seasonal weather slowdown in the China, Japan, Korea geomarket.  WesternGeco pretax income was $196 million, was a sequential drop in margin by 502 basis points to 29.1%. The reduction in multi-client sales and margins following the record sale in the previous quarter more than offset the modest recovery in marine performance.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 19.1%, which was lower than last quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of tax examination in a number of countries. The ETR is expected to be in the low 20s for the total year 2008.  The earnings for the quarter included $41 million dollar of expenses relating to stock-based compensation costs. Net debt of $2.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $564 million for a stock buy-back program and $833 million for CapEx, including multi-client. CapEx excluding $81 million of multi-client survey capitalized was $772 million for the quarter.  During the quarter, we bought back 7 million shares for $564 million at an average price of $81.16 per share. As we are approaching the completion of the $40 million share buy-back, the board of directors approved a new repurchase program for $8 billion to be completed before the end of 2011.  And now I will turn the conference over to Andrew. 
Andrew F. Gould: Thank you, Simon and good morning, everybody. Seasonal factors, weather related events, as well as lower product and software sales following the exceptional levels in the fourth quarter had a general dampening effect on sequential revenue gains with a consequent effect on margin.  Oilfield services revenue growth was strongest in the Canada, U.S. Gulf Coast, South Russia, Australia, Papua, New Guinea, Western Southern Africa, and Alaska geomarkets. Sequential revenue also grew through consolidation of FRAMO into the Europe/CIS/Africa area.  Among the technologies, demand was strongest for wireline, drilling and measurements, well services, and well testing activities.  In terms of geography, North America recorded the strongest growth as activity increased in the Gulf of Mexico, with the return of deep water rigs together with stronger demand for wireline and drilling and measurements exploration related services.  Canada saw a robust winter drilling season with high demand for wireline services in a renewed exploration market, as well as for well services technologies. Alaska benefited from exploration related growth.  The combination of these factors, which largely outweighed seasonal and weather events, as well as lower product [inaudible], translated into stronger margins, although pricing weakness continued to be seen in U.S. Central for well stimulation related activities.  In Latin America, growth was strongest in the Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago geomarkets from higher demand for drilling and measurements, wireline and well services, as well as from higher SIS product sales. However, this was more than offset by project transitions and delays in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and in Mexico and Central America. Lower artificial lift and SIS product sales also offset overall growth.  Against the slight decline in revenue, margins lowered more significantly as the integrated project management activity in Mexico continued its rapid ramp-up of new projects with an additional seven drilling rigs being deployed in the quarter, resulting in heavy initial start-up costs being incurred. The majority of these new projects are in areas where wells are much deeper and hotter and as a result, take longer to drill.  Growth in the Europe, CIS and Africa was driven by a variety of positive factors. These included higher artificial lift system sales and increased well services market penetration in South Russia, strong demand for well services technologies in Continental Europe, increased demand for drilling and measurement technologies in Western Southern Africa and the Caspian, and higher IPM and drilling and measurements activity in North Africa. Area sequential growth also benefited from the consolidation of FRAMO revenue.  These positive factors were however mitigated by operational delays in the North Sea, winter weather in East Russia, and lower SIS product sales.  Sequential revenue in Middle East and Asia area declined slightly as exploration driven growth for wireline and well testing services in the Australia, Papua New Guinea geomarket, together with strong demand for wireline, well testing, and well services in the Gulf, East Mediterranean and the Thailand/Vietnam geomarkets were offset by the impact of winter weather in the China/Japan/Korea and lower completions and artificial lift systems product sales also contributed to this performance.  At WesternGeco, first quarter results fell sequentially as multi-client revenues declined steeply from the record levels of the fourth quarter. The Gulf of Mexico lease sale late in the quarter, coupled with the increased cost of wide-azimuth data sets that are fast becoming the norm for new multi-client purchases, delayed new activity until customers absorbed the results of the March leasing round.  In contrast, however, Marine revenue increased as both vessel utilization and productivity improved following the vessel dry docks and seasonal transits for the prior quarter. Data processing recorded a sequential increase in revenue while land declined as a result of project completions in North America and lower demand in the Middle East.  Looking ahead in the short to medium term, we expect a number of scheduled dry dock expense and vessel transit in the second quarter as activity switches from winter to summer seasons, while the uneven pattern in multi-client activity is likely to persist throughout the year.  WesternGeco technology applications saw growth during the quarter with a confirmation of a further set of Q-Marine time lapse surveys in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea for StatoilHydro on the Norne and Heidrun fields. These surveys represent the fifth successive survey at Norne and the third at Heidrun. Both form part of the ongoing efforts to maximize recovery from both fields through the identification of unswept and partially swept areas.  Q technology has also been selected for deployment of Q-Seabed surveys on the Oseberg Sor and Gullfaks fields, where the technology’s low frequency capability is considered to be of particular value.  And in the sub-salt environment of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, processing has begun of integrated Q-Marine gravity and magnetotelluric electromagnetic data sets that form part of the E-Octopus multi-client wide-azimuth acquisition program.  Other new technology applications include well services FUTUR active set-cement which provides long-term zonal information through self-healing properties upon contact with any hydrocarbon based formation fluid. In Canada, this unique technology was used in an active geological area where maintaining cement integrity has been problematic. And in Italy, its use began on a 50 well natural gas storage field to prevent leakage of storage gas where wells are subject to alternating injection and production, in line with storage gas use.  Another new well services technology unique to Schlumberger, ACTive coil tubing, was deployed in Western Canada and Malaysia. The ACTive family of services uses fiber-optic cable in a down hole sensor package to monitor progress from a range of coil tubing enabled operations in real time.  In addition to these technology deployments, we passed a significant milestone in recruiting and training during the quarter with the opening of the Siberian Training Center in the Russian Federation in March. This new center includes all the facilities needed to train and develop our Russian languages employees in artificial lift, directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, data services and information solutions, as well as integrated project management. The current training capacity is expected to double over the next year to reach 350 students.  In closing, I would like to reiterate some comments that I made at the Howard Weil conference in New Orleans earlier this month. In the absence of severe global recession leading to a steep drop in demand, the thin cushion of excess oil supply and the failure to stem decline rates in many countries, coupled with a higher-than-expected drawdown of U.S. natural gas storage, are all factors that lead us to conclude the growth will strengthen as the year progresses. We remain convinced that current investment levels are insufficient to both stem decline and to explore and develop new reserves. As a result, we anticipate that the current cycle of exploration and production spending will remain stronger for a longer period than we originally anticipated.  I am now going to hand the call back to Gail. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: I guess the first question has to do with the comment that you made on the fourth quarter conference call regarding ’08 being a transition year, particularly listening to some of the Geco commentary for Q2 and second half, I’m wondering if you wanted to perhaps revisit that within the context of is 2008 going to be a transition year or is it a first half transition?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that when I made the comment in December, Michael, I was thinking it was a transition year. I would say that what has happened in North America, coupled with as I’m sure you’ve noticed some fairly dramatic declines in oil production in a number of places around the world, leaves me to believe that absent this global recession it’s more and more a year in which growth is going to strengthen significantly in the second half. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: We’ve been -- I guess all eyes have been on Russia and Mexico here in the first quarter, second quarter timeframe. Anywhere else? I understand seismic activity in India is very robust right now. Anything in the Eastern Hemisphere that we should be keeping an eye on?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, India, we just tell our board of directors here because firstly, it’s our 75th anniversary in India but secondly because as you say, there is a dramatic increase in the willingness of India to find out whether it has any chance of domestic energy security and therefore huge investment in seismic and hopefully following that exploration, drilling. And as you know, they have one or two very large development programs that are underway. So I think that perhaps for us, the really interesting thing in Indian seismic is the fact that we have a -- our second largest processing worldwide is in India and we work very closely with the Indian industry on how to interpret Q to the maximum advantage. But it’s symptomatic of perhaps the willingness of developing countries to find out what chance they have in energy security. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Should we think about India as seismic for ’08/09 and the exploration and drilling in 2010 perhaps?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think -- I don’t know their rig -- I don’t think their rig program is fixed yet but certainly I think that as soon as they can get rigs, they will start exploration drilling. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. Thank you, Andrew. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Co. Please go ahead. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : With regard to seismic, I am trying to reconcile on the one hand the very favorable demand outlook that not only hearing from you but from others, with the fact that backlog has evolved rather slowly. Over the past three to six months, we’re down 20% quarter on quarter. Walk us through with respect to the intermediate outlook with respect to contracting your vessels and what we should expect with regard to backlog build as the year unfolds. 
Andrew F. Gould: I think that some of the significant drop in the backlog is due to the fact that we have some very long-term commitments that have not yet been renewed but I would say are currently in the state of being bid. So I would suspect that, just as I said to Michael now, that to look for a significant increase in the backlog, you are probably looking into the second half year. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Okay, got it. 
Andrew F. Gould: But there is no lack of bids out there. There is no lack of tendering, believe me. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : That’s what I figured. Secondly, I was struck by the fact that there was no mention of what’s going on with respect to Saudi Arabia and your rumored new contract there. 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, it’s not a rumor. I mean, -- but what strikes you, Bill?
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Well, there was no mention of it, no detail, no information provided on it. 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, you probably realize we don’t make announcements of any individual contract wins that we have. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Well just more plainly, could you enlighten us as to the parameters of that engagement?
Andrew F. Gould: All right, so [Manipur] is -- have we started to mobilize equipment? Yes. Is it eventually big? Yes. When will it start producing incremental revenue? A little bit in Q2 and the rest of the year but really ramping up in ’09, not ’08. That’s about what I would tell you, Bill. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : That’s all I have. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Dan Pickering with Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt: Andrew, for the last couple of quarters you’ve talked about expectations around the revenue growth in your business. We did not hear that commentary at least this quarter as it relates to kind of where Wall Street is at. Can we assume that silence means that expectations are now in generally the right spot?
Andrew F. Gould: I am very comfortable with Wall Street’s assumptions on the full year 2008, Dan. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt: Fantastic. Second question, back to the seismic business, last year end of the year we sort of saw a fair -- Marine take a fairly significant down-tick with some dry dockings and utilization. It didn’t feel like it bounced up much here in the Q1, Andrew, and now we are looking for some more dry docks in Q2. I guess where I’m going with this is, is there a change in the profitability of the Marine business or is this just a fairly lengthy period of getting all the assets in the right place?
Andrew F. Gould: Actually, I would say two things, Dan. Firstly there is a considerable pricing difference between winter season and summer season and they -- there is more and more a shift that takes place every winter and summer, so the actual number of transits that we do is increasing.  I don’t think that we feel that that is going to affect the overall profitability of Marine if you take it on an annual basis. But I’ve been trying to convey the message that seismic is going to be lumpy and it’s lumpy in both marine and multi-client. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Charles Minervino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. I just wanted to touch on Russia a little bit. I saw that oil production was down in 1Q and several companies here are obviously moving aggressively in Russia in the services market. Could you just talk a little bit about how you are positioned there right now and really how you are going to grow? Will it be predominantly organic growth or will it be -- will you be looking at M&A in Russia?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think our feeling is that M&A -- Russia is now over-priced. We’ve made our big moves and therefore I suspect that going forward, it’s going to be organic and a lot of it will be IPM. So I don’t -- we will do some M&A but nothing like the scale of what we did in the past four or five years.  And if you look at our business, then the well services market, the fracking market is over-supplied. The big growth element these days are services around drilling. 
Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs: Okay and just another question with regard to the offshore business. Can you talk a little bit about how your margins are in the offshore business? And then as we go forward here with the new build rigs coming, what that can mean for margins I guess one, two, maybe three years down the road?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think our offshore margins are fine. I really -- there’s no significant shift in our offshore margins and going forward, the quality of our revenue will improve and the extent to which our quality of revenue improves really depends on the number of new rigs that are on exploration and then the exploration success that they have.  We have huge margin variation between a successful exploration well and an unsuccessful exploration well. 
Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs: That’s really helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: We’ll go to David Anderson with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Anderson - UBS: Thank you. You mentioned just a few minutes ago the growth was going to significantly increase in the second half of the year. I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit further. Was that just primarily centered around North America or were there some other regions? Because it seems to me that the offshore, the impact of the offshore new builds is more of a 2009 event, so I was just wondering if you can expand on that a bit. 
Andrew F. Gould: Firstly, you are quite right to point out that the most significant change, compared to what I said in December because the remarks I made a few minutes ago were a function of what I said in the December call. The biggest shift is North America and that’s true for revenue as well.  And overseas, I think that firstly we are -- I am personally still astonished at the demand for IPM and I think that the, if you like, perhaps I had underestimated the extent to which land drilling might expand, but I would caution you that this is very much a second half event. 
David Anderson - UBS: Okay, and then just to touch back on Russia, we did notice there were some changes in the upstream tax regime and it doesn’t look like it’s had too much of an impact. Are you feeling a bit more optimistic that some more material changes could be coming about and is that kind of the next leg as to what’s going to spur IPM work? And is this a 2009 event for you?
Andrew F. Gould: I think the Russian Government will do what is necessary to release the money that is required to increase, to sustain or to increase production in function of their 2% a year objective and I agree with you that what they have announced so far is not sufficient. But I am pretty sure that they will get it right in the end. So it could -- you are quite right that largely it will be a 2009 event. 
David Anderson - UBS: Okay, and then just one last question on Mexico -- some of that proposed energy bill, there was some more performance based service contracts were mentioned in that, in the bill. I was just wondering, how does that impact your view on that market? And does, once again going back to IPM I guess, does that imply there is more IPM work on the horizon or is this really not going to go through?
Andrew F. Gould: Not so much that I think it will change their IPM programs but what it will allow us to do, which is going to be a very nice change, is it will allow us to be incentivized on the basis of the performance of technology, which is something very difficult to achieve under the current contractual regime. 
David Anderson - UBS: So you feel pretty optimistic that goes through?
Andrew F. Gould: I think it’s a -- well, I don’t know. I’m not speculating on the politics but if it does go through, it’s probably a positive for everybody. 
David Anderson - UBS: Thank you. 
Operator: We’ll go to Geoff Kieburtz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: The more positive outlook for North America in the prepared comments, there were several references to the continued weakening trend of North American stimulation prices. How do you see that playing out? Is your outlook for the North American market sufficiently more positive that you think that will turn around?
Andrew F. Gould: I think that we’ve seen the bottom, or we are seeing the bottom right now. Now obviously contractually, most of what we are going to do in 2008 is tied up. There is obviously some capacity that is not tied up and depending on the size of the rig count increase, there might be a little bit of pricing levers towards the end of the year. But that’s not clear yet.  What I can say fairly definitively is we see in stimulation services, pricing is bottoming. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Do you see pricing leverage in any other product lines in the -- 
Andrew F. Gould: I think that drilling and measurements, anything to do with directional drilling in the North American, as in most other markets, still has some pricing leverage. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: And shifting to Latin America, could you maybe give us a little bit more historical context? I mean, we heard in the fourth quarter, we’re hearing again in the first quarter about start-up costs on IPM projects principally in Mexico. That’s been a very big business for you for some time. What’s going on? Are the projects shifting to different locations or what kind of is going on?
Andrew F. Gould: So the answer is both. In other words, the projects are shifting to different locations so the two large projects we’ve been mobilizing in the last six months are both in the Villahermosa Basin, which is deep and hot and at the same time, we’ve been mobilizing again rigs to Chicontepec and we will in the second quarter be mobilizing Burgos 7. So Burgos 7 and Chicontepec, if you like, is the traditional IPM activity in Mexico. The stuff in the south is the new IPM activity in Mexico. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Both volume and mix then, basically. 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, both volume and mix but the whole -- the whole number of contracts, our IPM tenders has changed scale in the last year. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: And your comment about IPM more broadly, because you’ve mentioned it in the context of other regions as well, should we hear or interpret those comments to mean that we are going to see more of this, where project start-up, margin effects become more common?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I don’t think we’ll have many projects that start on the scale of what we are starting in Mexico, so to that extent, no. There will I think be a project start-up effect in every quarter but probably at a decreasing level, at least for the balance of this year, a decreasing level per quarter, Geoff. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you, Andrew. 
Operator: We’ll go to James Crandell with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. To follow-up on that question, Andrew, on the IPM business, do you see the IPM business getting more price competitive today and if it is going to spread, will more and more NOCs be looking for increased price concessions and IPM work in the future, if that’s competitively bid?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, firstly we don’t -- I don’t -- I know what you’ve been hearing, Jim. We don’t see IPM as being any more price competitive today than it was two or three years ago. What is true is that every time we go to a new basin, there is a learning curve and going up that learning curve takes a little time but once you are up it, you actually have a huge competitive advantage and we just celebrated drilling our 1,000th well in the Burgos field. When you’ve drilled a thousand wells, you probably have a pretty good knowledge of how to do it and actually the levels of return we make out of those projects have improved over time, whatever’s happened to the pricing. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and I have a question also about E&P spending, Andrew. Our work suggests that we’ve added upwards of $10 billion now to the E&P spend since our survey was published in December and maybe 40% of that is in North America. Do you think as you look at the U.S. today that we could be looking at additions of somewhere in the range of 200 to 250 rigs over the course of this year? And internationally, I guess would you think that the recovery is stronger that what you thought previously, given budget announcements and the higher oil prices and that you could with some confidence now look at least a 20% revenue growth in your international oil services business in ’08?
Andrew F. Gould: I feel quite confident that the international spending is going to increase and we weren’t that far from the number you mentioned, so it’s not in any way impossible.  I think in terms of North America, I don’t really have a good enough read to know whether it’s 100 or 200 rigs yet. I don’t know. I think it will depend a little bit on the economy and a little bit on the capacity of the industry to follow, but it’s not impossible.  I just don’t -- 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and -- 
Andrew F. Gould: -- you said 200 and 250, I don’t feel confident yet of that level. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay, but you will pretty soon -- 
Andrew F. Gould: That was just U.S. That was just U.S., Jim, right?
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Just U.S., Andrew, right. And one other quick question; Andrew, how many in total seismic vessels between Eastern Echo and what you are building, you were intending to build any way, do you have on -- either on order or in the plan? And can you give me a rough idea on the timing of delivery of those?
Andrew F. Gould: We have eight vessels on order. We will get one more this year which is not an Eastern Echo one, it’s a Blue Arrow, which will come in the third quarter. We will start taking delivery of Eastern Echo in Q1 next year and substantially most of Eastern Echo should be in the course of ’09. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question is from Brad Handler with Wachovia. Please go ahead.
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Thanks. Could you please speak some more to the buying behavior related to wide and rich azimuth multi-client? I guess I’m just a little confused about whether or not there is some sacrifice of sales that gets made if you sell things after a specific oil company has the lease sale as opposed to before where you might have had more bidders. 
Andrew F. Gould: I think that your point is a valid point but actually what it does is to add an additional risk, which is that you shot your seismic in the right place for that particular client to buy it as he’s buying it, when he knows what lease he has. Whereas before, he was buying much cheaper seismic but on the basis that he would be -- he might be bidding any number of blocks.  So it does add an additional risk but I am not uncomfortable with the coverage that we have in view of the last lease sale.  I think there are three things in the multi-client for 2008. The first is there was some buying in Q4 in anticipation of the lease sale. The second is the lease sale was extremely late in the quarter and has all the implications of wide-azimuth data. And the third is that we have three phases of E-Octopus to deliver during the second half of the year, which will add a considerable volume of new product to our library. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Okay. If I could stay with this just for a couple of other follow-ups, I just want to make sure I get it; so assuming the risk variable, and I appreciate you telling us about that, assuming that that works itself out favorably, do you have any reason to think that your wide azimuth prospects have lessened relative to what you may have thought about a year or two ago when you first sort of ventured into the Gulf of Mexico region?
Andrew F. Gould: Wide-azimuth, no, I don’t. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Okay, so the pricing dynamic is -- 
Andrew F. Gould: There may be timing differences but I don’t think it’s lessened overall volume prospects. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Okay, that’s helpful. Is it fair for us to think about 2Q as having a pretty healthy snap back in multi-client based on the fact that we’ve gotten through this lease sale?
Andrew F. Gould: I would think more in terms of the second half year. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Okay. 
Andrew F. Gould: Because as I said, we have new product to deliver and I don’t think we’ll deliver a lot of it in Q2 and there is another lease sale coming up in October. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Okay. And then is pre-funding levels changing at all as it relates to wide-azimuth?
Andrew F. Gould: They are not as healthy as they were I think perhaps two or three years ago when we were pre-funding normal reprocessing projects and normal 3D, but they are still pretty healthy. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Again, I guess getting back to that risk point you made. Okay, one sort of side -- I’m not sure if it’s important at all but there was a press release by electromagnetic geoservices about a patent case in The Netherlands. Again, forgive me if this is completely trivial but is that at all relevant to your business? Does it at all hamper any of your efforts for the -- 
Andrew F. Gould: No, I mean, to be -- the press release I felt was somewhat disingenuous. The Dutch Court did not rule; it deferred the decision to the European Patent Office, so no patents were validated or invalidated. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Ken Sill with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Andrew, I wanted to ask a question, something that’s kind of popped up in the comments as an area of weakness was Schlumberger Information Systems. It was weak in North America and a lot of other regions. I wondered if you could give us a little bit of insight into is this another business that is going to be seasonal or was this just a year-on-year rollover?
Andrew F. Gould: It’s traditionally -- SIS information systems is a bit like seismic in as much as customers use up their budgets at year-end to purchase software and in a year when our growth rate is a bit slower than it was in the past two years, that shows up in Q1 as opposed to Q4. So we had very, very high sales in Q4 and lower sales in Q1 but it’s not new. It’s just showing up more. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Yeah, I knew it had been there and my next question was kind of is this something that -- are the margins in information systems solution very different from what you are getting in your kind of core oil field service businesses?
Andrew F. Gould: They are very good. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: They are very -- so this would be a high margin business -- 
Andrew F. Gould: This is a software business, yes. This is a software business. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Yeah, so and then in terms of the seasonal recovery, kind of expect something gradual and building to a year-end crescendo again?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: So just -- and then to kind of close the gap here, so you are very happy with where Wall Street is for the year. Obviously we have the pattern wrong, pretty clear. What is your outlook now for 2009? I know it’s awful early but you are going to have the deep water rigs on, North America will be growing fairly substantially. I mean, does tightening up North America help pricing power globally in the outlook for ’09?
Andrew F. Gould: I think it would need quite a lot of tightening to -- basically you are talking about pressure pumping. Segments where Schlumberger participates, you are talking about pressure pumping and I think that it would take quite a lot of tightening to really affect overseas markets.  And I was warned by Malcolm that somebody would ask me about ’09, so my gut feeling and it’s no more than a gut feeling, is that ’09 will be better than ’08 in terms of growth, overall growth. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: In overall growth?
Andrew F. Gould: I know that doesn’t help you very much but really, it is awfully early. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Well, and you don’t want to get too excited about things but I just wanted to get your feel for that early in the year. Okay, thank you, Andrew. 
Operator: We’ll go to Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Thanks. Andrew, I wonder about profit margins; they came in a little bit below my expectations for oil field in a couple of markets, Latin America obviously I guess is a function of to some degree of Mexico and other issues. And then the Europe/CIS. Do you expect the -- I’m wondering if margins have peaked for the cycle or are these kind of short-term factors and there is still margin upside, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere markets where you are so strong?
Andrew F. Gould: I don’t think you can make a judgment on the basis of Q1, so Latin America is very definitely a function of Mexico but also the project disruption that I pointed out in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, and a little bit in the south where we had an activity stoppage.  And in Europe/Africa/CIS, I would say that there is no reason to suppose that has gone down permanently. It’s largely seasonal plus the inclusion of FRAMO as a consolidated item for the first time. Before it was an equity pick-up. And FRAMO’s margins, while very healthy, are not at the same level as OFS. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Okay, so there’s a little bit of an apples-to-oranges comp there?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Okay, and then you talked about the tight global supplies and one of the issues that I have is that governments around the world seem to be with collective greed conspiring to slow things down. Is that a significant concern of yours, I mean, Russia being one place that’s pretty obvious but other places as well -- for instance, Venezuela. 
Andrew F. Gould: Alaska. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: The U.S., I suppose. 
Andrew F. Gould: You are quite correct. It is a concern, Kevin. Our governments think they can tax $100 oil with impunity and that’s not the case. And it’s not so much the amount of the tax; it’s the fact that it produces a degree of uncertainty into our customers’ investment decisions and therefore they have to presume a certain degree of risk, which makes them shy. So you are quite right to point out it is a concern. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: But to some degree in a way, it’s baked into your thinking that high comfort level, that an ’09 growth is going to be -- we’ll say comfortably in excess of -- 
Andrew F. Gould: ’09 growth is more dependent on offshore, which as you know is very long-term and therefore, governments tend to behave more rationally, if you like. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Yeah, well, they have less leverage there. All right, thank you. That’s it for me. 
Operator: We’ll go to Benjamin Dell at Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Dell - Sanford C. Bernstein: I know you’ve had a lot of questions around the seismic business but maybe I could just ask one on 2009. We obviously have a big stream of capacity expansion which actually accelerates into 2009. How do you see that impacting margins in this business?
Andrew F. Gould: If there is an erosion in Marine margins, it’s going to be towards the end of 2009. It’s not going to be at the beginning. And in fact, capacity is so solidly absorbed for 2008 that any erosion in 2009 is going to be minor. I would worry more about 2010 if I were you. Because 2009 there is a clear demand today and you can match that demand to the capacity that’s coming on. 
Benjamin Dell - Sanford C. Bernstein: And when you look at the application of multi-azimuth seismic outside the Gulf of Mexico, obviously the Gulf’s got pretty unique geology in terms of its salt [inaudible]. Which other basins do you see that being applied to? Because it appears that only really Angola has the potential for sub-salt [layers]. 
Andrew F. Gould: West Africa. I mean, Nigeria, some of the deep water in Nigeria. Some in Brazil. There’s certainly applications in India, where I am now but it’s actually more basalt than salt, which is a slightly different problem. There are applications in the northern parts of the North Sea; again it’s largely -- it’s basalt rather than salt, but you are quite right to point out that the two large markets are the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, but I wouldn’t rule out Nigeria. I wouldn’t say just Angola. 
Benjamin Dell - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay and just lastly, you mentioned your seismic vessel additions. Did you cancel the options on the fifth and sixth Eastern Echo boats or not?
Andrew F. Gould: No, we didn’t.
Benjamin Dell - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: We’ll go to Pierre Turner with [inaudible]. Please go ahead. 
Pierre Turner : That was close but good morning, gentlemen. Most of the questions have been answered, maybe a little bit more on Marine and the pre-funding. Andrew, would you care to speculate a little bit -- you did mention that it was I think down sequentially from where it had been, but could you tell us where you might expect pre-funding to end up on some of your large multi-client Gulf of Mexico?
Andrew F. Gould: Actually, probably I should have been more explicit, yeah. One of the things that is happening is we were pre-funding reprocessing projects where the actual investment on our part was much smaller than in multi-client acquisition, and therefore we had very, very high pre-funding ratios and they were very often way over 100%. So our pre-funding ratios in function of the acquisition programs have dropped below 100%, but I would still describe them as healthy and we tend not to commit unless we feel we have an adequate pre-funding ratio. 
Pierre Turner : So on an -- I think that is helpful color because your point is that on an absolute basis, and is that what your commentary is about the library sales, that basically the budgets are such people are spending it on the pre-funding of enhanced azimuth information. 
Andrew F. Gould: But you know, there is still an after-sales market beyond the pre-funding in wide azimuth. It’s just that -- that’s why I mentioned this additional risk factor that your wide azimuth is in the right place. 
Pierre Turner : Okay. The other one with just a little bit more color again had to do with IPM start-ups, and I appreciate that you have addressed a number of issues related to that, but to the extent we could get a feel for how much are we through the start-up costs and maybe some -- how many rigs we have on IPM and where do you expect that to be at the end of ’08? Is it in terms of increases and -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Well I mean, in the last year we started about 35 rigs. We are going to start another six but they are the Burgos ones in Q2 and Burgos ones, I really don’t think there will be a huge start-up issue in that, so that leaves another 10 around the world for the balance of the year.  So I think it’s safe to assume that the start-up cost element in the quarterly results will decrease from now going forward. 
Pierre Turner : Okay. That’s the color I was looking for. The rest has been answered. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Operator: We’ll go to Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Just going to hit you out right with this one -- so when do you think the peak is, Andrew, 2013 or 2015?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, you know, you are going to have to make so many assumptions on the economy and all the rest of it that that’s a very, very difficult one to call. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Let’s just say predicated on the decline rates you see in Mexico and Canterell and some issues in Russia -- 
Andrew F. Gould: I don’t think this cycle is going to peak without a drop in demand, and a drop in demand can come two ways; it can come violently through a global economic recession or it can come gradually, which is through the gradual substitution of hydrocarbons with other sources of energy. And if that’s the case, you know, it’s a long -- any transition to meaningful volumes of another source of energy is a decade or longer. So take your pick which way it is going to happen. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: In that period from 1970 to 1980, according to stats I pulled together, E&P spending grew like 25% a year on average over that decade. Do you think there’s a possibility that the next five years or so could replicate that 25% a year on E&P spend?
Andrew F. Gould: Well you see, I think this cycle is very different from 1970 to 1980, and it’s different in two senses. One is that in 1970 to 1980, I think that there was some physical shortage but really it was a political shortage. The other thing is that the developments that took place in the 1970s, which were basically added six or seven million barrels or even more a day were Alaska, Mexico, and the North Sea, and those discoveries were made in the 1960s. So there was no exploration to be done.  So this time I think it is much more difficult, if you like, to see where the development is going to come that is going to produce significant volumes except for the Middle East, Central Asia, and Russia. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: And how do we -- how do you think we should consider your growth rate opportunity in Brazil, you know, follow-on with the Tupi and now some of this chatter around the Carioca field. Where is your opportunity set down there? Maybe you could discuss it by product line importance. And then how should we think about the growth rates in Brazil in general?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that I would characterize 2008 as good and 2009 as excellent basically because the large addition of [Floaters] is going to be in 2009, not 2008. And contractually we are very -- we are mostly very pleased with what we have. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: That’s for Brazil, right?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, Brazil. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: And how about in terms of product line importance for you in Brazil? How would you rank it?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, it’s very important for wireline. It’s extremely important for testing. It’s important for D&M but not as important as it should be, and well services and the others have a presence but -- we have a very satisfactory position. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: And if I may just close out here, is there any -- is the opportunity set on land in Brazil, are there any good possibilities there or is it mostly just going to be the offshore as we’ve heard?
Andrew F. Gould: There is some opportunity on land but it is not going to be anything on the same scale as offshore. 
Operator: And our final question today comes from Robin Shoemaker with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: In your Q&A, you have the statement that you’re 33% third-party content in IPM and that that will be increasing to mid-40s. Is this increasing content of third-party services in any way related to the delays you are experiencing? And what should we think about in terms of overall integrated project margins as third-party content increases from 33% to the mid-40s. 
Andrew F. Gould: I don’t think it’s a question of delay; it’s more a question of different work scopes. Simon, would you like to comment on the margin evolution?
Simon Ayat: You are raising a very valid question here about the third-party element of our services provided under the IPM contracts. These don’t attract the same type of margin regionally on our services. Our services are at least the same type of margin we generate or even better. Now, the third party, we do cover our costs associated with them but they are lower margin.  Now, what you’ve seen, the 33% versus the 40% through the year, I don’t think it’s going to affect the overall margins of the projects because the efficiency on the rest of the activity would be more than compensating the small deterioration that a 7% decrease will cause. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Okay. And then the only other question I had was Andrew, you commented on a little bit on the acquisitions market, M&A market in Russia as somewhat over-priced. Can you comment overall on Schlumberger's acquisition strategy? We see recently a lot of M&A activity and also private equity getting involved in purchasing oilfield service assets in companies. Can we read into this expanded share buy-back program that there is perhaps a little less attractive acquisition opportunities for Schlumberger? 
Andrew F. Gould: No. In the calculation of the amount of cash available for buy-back, we have assumed the same level of acquisitions as we’ve generally been practicing over the last three or four years. Now, I don’t think you will see us as I’ve said on many occasions make a major acquisition, particularly at these valuations. However, increasingly we will make niche acquisitions largely for parts of our service line that we don’t have or for technology opportunities that we identify.  But it doesn’t -- the program in itself does not signal and reduction in our acquisition strategy. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thank you.
Malcolm Theobald: On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today’s call. Gail will now provide the closing comments.

Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) We’ll now turn the call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead. 
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Rod. Welcome to today’s fourth quarter and full year 2007 results conference call for Schlumberger Limited. Before we begin today’s call, I’d like to review the logistics and agenda.  Some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request.  For today’s agenda, Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer, will begin with commentary on the financial results. And then Andrew Gould, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the fourth quarter and full year activity and outlook. Finally, we’ll take questions from the audience.  And now, Simon Ayat will discuss the financials. 
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter net income was $1.11 per share excluding the $0.01 gain from the sale of four oil rigs in Russia, up $0.02 sequentially and $0.19 above the same quarter of last year.  Oilfield services Q4 activity growth was strong at 6.2% sequentially, helped by artificial lift and completions product sales. In addition, there was increased third quarter revenue on IPM projects.  WesternGeco reported very strong multi-client sales. However, this was offset by the seasonal drop in the high margin marine activity due to vessel transits and dry docks.  Oilfield services generated $1.5 billion in pretax operating income, up $30 million from the third quarter but margins declined by 116 basis points to 28.2%. By area, oilfield services highlights were as follows. My comments are on a sequential basis.  North America pretax margin declined 151 basis points to 25.4% due to continued erosion of pressure pumping stimulation pricing in the U.S. land market and weather related operational restrictions in the Rockies. This was partly compensated by increased activity in Canada and a better quarter in the Gulf of Mexico, where the gradual return of drilling rigs after last quarter’s hurricane season.  Latin America processor margin was 158 basis points lower to reach 22.1%. Activity on margins improved in all geo-markets with the exception of the Mexico Central America geo-market, where revenue increased but the impact of the flooding in Mexico, project start-up costs and increased third party revenue negatively impacted the overall Latin America margins.  For ECA, the Europe, CIS, Africa area, the pretax margin declined 130 basis points to 27.9%, as Russia exhibited the seasonal slowdown at the beginning of the winter season of offshore [settling]. Strong activity was reported in the North Sea, Caspian, and Continental Europe geo-markets.  Middle East Asia pretax margin increased by $36 million but in percentage terms declined by 65 basis points to 35%. Improvements were recorded in the Arabian geo-market with higher equipment sales and overall increased activity in both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  The India geo-market benefited from strong deepwater exploration activity and in Asia, improvement in the China, Japan, Korea were offset by declines in the Thailand, Vietnam geo-market on reduced exploration.  WesternGeco pretax income was $272 million, with a sequential drop in margin by 452 basis points to 34.1%. Marine activity and margins dropped as a result of the seasonal repositioning of the fleet with increased transit time and dry docks. The reduction in marine margins could not be compensated by the surge in multi-client sales.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 20.4%, slightly lower than last quarter, reflecting the continued shift of activity from North America to the rest of the world. In 2008, we expect the effective tax rate to remain in the low 20s. However, there may be some quarterly volatility due to the geographic mix of activity.  The earnings for the quarter included $33 million of expenses relating to stock-based compensation costs in line with the previous quarter. We expect this expense for the full year 2008 to be approximately $108 million, a $44 million increase over 2007.  At year-end, net debt was $1.9 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $557 million for the stock buy-back program; $984 million for CapEx, including multi-client; and $699 million for the Eastern Echo transaction. CapEx excluding $65 million dollar of multi-client surveys capitalized was $919 million for the quarter, reaching $2.9 billion for total year 2007.  CapEx for 2008 is expected to be $3.8 billion, including $2.9 billion for oilfield services and $870 million for WesternGeco, of which $365 million is for the vessels acquired through the Eastern Echo transactions.  During the quarter, we bought back 5.8 million shares for $557 million at an average price of $95.65. This brings the total share buy-back under the 40 million share repurchase program announced in April ’06 to 29.9 million shares for $2.2 billion at an average price of $72.53 per share.  The Board of Directors approved a 20% dividend increase, representing a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, reflecting the positive long-term outlook.  And now I turn the conference over to Andrew. 
Andrew F. Gould: Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. Schlumberger revenues in 2007 grew by 21%, driven by strong demand for oilfield services, particularly in the overseas areas where year-on-year growth reached 31% in Middle East and Asia, 30% in Europe, CIS, Africa, 29% in Latin America. By contrast, North America remained essentially flat with 2006.  All technologies showed double-digit improvement, with drilling and measurements, well testing, and integrated product management recording the highest overall growth rates.  In the fourth quarter, strong sequential growth contributed significantly to this overall performance. However, the quarter’s results were impacted by a number of events that resulted in less-than-satisfactory margins. These included a less favorable oilfield services revenue mix with lower pricing and well stimulation related activities on land in the United States; a number of exceptional and seasonal weather effects in the U.S., Mexico, the North Sea, and Russia; the expensing of significant start-up costs associated with the IPM Mezosoico and Alianza projects in Mexico, where the second half of 2007 saw integrated product management mobilize and start 17 drilling rigs within the scope of these projects; an increased marine utilization of the WesternGeco fleet through vessel transit and dry dock inspections that overweighed a sequential 83% in multi-client sales.  However, with the exception of the pricing for well stimulation related activities on land in the U.S., these events were largely seasonal and do not reflect any change in the underlying trends.  Looking at the quarter in more detail, the sequential growth of 3% in North America was led by the Canada geo-market with increased demand for well services and wireline technologies; activity partially recovered from the hurricane season in the U.S. Gulf Coast with higher demand from wireline, well testing, and well services activities; and SIS product sales were higher across the North America area.  However, this largely positive performance was offset by continuing price erosion in well stimulation related activities in U.S. land geo-markets, as well as by seasonal land access constraints in the west and lower activity in Alaska.  In Latin America, sequential growth reached 9% overall and was seen in all geo-markets, primarily driven by IPM activities in Mexico and Central America, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago.  Increased demand for well testing technologies and higher artificial lift and completion systems product sales in Latin America South, together with increased artificial lift and completion systems product sales in Mexico, Central America and Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, contributed to these results.  In Europe, CIS and Africa, the sequential growth of 4% was driven by the North Sea geo-market, with increased demand for wireline and well services technologies, together with higher artificial lift systems and SIS product sales.  Greater demand for drilling and measurements in the Caspian geo-market, increased sales of artificial lift in North Russia, and high demand for drilling measurements, well services and well testing in Continental Europe contributed to growth.  Performance was partially offset by the usual seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin and continuing subdued activity in Nigeria.  The Middle East Asia are recorded double-digit sequential growth of 10% as the Arabian geo-market saw high demand for drilling and measurements and wireline services, as well as higher completions and artificial lift systems and SIS product sales.  Sequential growth was also driven by a higher demand for exploration related drilling and measurements technologies and artificial lift systems in Qatar; increased demand for drilling and measurements and well testing services in China, Japan, Korea; and higher deepwater exploration driven demand for wireline, drilling and measurements technologies, together with SIS product sales in India.  Among oilfield services technologies, both well services and completion systems made significant progress during the quarter. New well services technologies, including members of the contact family of stage fracturing and completion services penetrated further into a number of key markets with a broad range of efficient and effective stimulation services.  In North America, StimMAP and AbrasiFRAC technologies saw greater interest and activity where their respective abilities to place fracturing treatments more accurately and to treat all productive sands in a single operation led to increased production at lower cost. AbrasiFRAC technology was also deployed in Saudi Arabia for Saudi Aramco, where coil tubing was used to apply the treatment in a natural gas well to result in an increase of production ten-fold.  Elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, StageFRAC technology was evaluated on two natural gas wells where improved production rates and increased estimates at ultimate recovery led to plans for further deployment in future horizontal gas wells.  Completion systems secured a significant contract for the Reslink ResFlow, passive in-flow completion technology in addition to increased sales in the quarter. This award followed tests by Saudi Aramco in both sandstone and carbonate reservoirs that showed excellent correlation between the production logging program and simulations developed by Saudi Aramco and Schlumberger. This success came just 12 months after the acquisition of Reslink by Schlumberger.  WesternGeco full year 2007 revenues increased 20% over 2006, while pretax operating income grew by 31%. Q-Technology revenues reached $1.14 billion, up 57% versus 2006. Overall vessel utilization for the full year was 93%.  The fourth quarter results, however, were hit by the seasonal effects of vessel transits and dry docks, which led to lower overall vessel utilization and which were significant enough to outweigh the exceedingly strong sequential increase in multi-client sales, which were up 83%.  The strength in the seismic market, particularly in marine, led us to review our long-term plans for the fleet and this led to our acquisition of Eastern Echo during the quarter. The six high-performance vessels on order are for high capacity and are ideally suited to the exploration and development markets of the future. Our plans are to equip all six vessels with Q systems as the boats become available in 2009 and beyond.  In another acquisition, we acquired an additional 5.5% in Framo Engineering, taking our holding to a majority of 52.75%. A Norwegian based company, Framo provides multiphase booster pumps, flow metering equipment and swivel stack systems and is an important contributor to sub-sea engineering projects.  Shorter term growth presents a more complex picture than the immediate past. Natural gas drilling in North America is not expected to vary greatly in the absence of any severe winter weather in the remaining two months. High utilization of the existing off-shore rig fleet worldwide and limited new builds entering the market during the year will not only limit growth but will also make activity vulnerable to rig operating efficiency.  However, growth in land activity outside North America will remain strong, while seismic exploration services worldwide will remain in high demand, both on land and off-shore, as the industry gears up for the expanding exploration cycle.  Within this context, technology that assists our customers in mitigating risk in exploration and development projects, increasing our recovery factors, and improving operational efficiency will remain at a premium.  In the longer term, however, current levels of drilling are increasingly insufficient to meaningfully slow decline rates, improve reservoir recovery, or add sufficient new production capacity. The explosion in exploration licenses awarded in the last three years, the continual expansion of the number of new offshore rigs being ordered for delivery through and beyond the end of the decade, and the industry-wide, as well as our own plans to increase both CapEx and research and development spend are clear indicators of future growth.  It is our view that only a global economic recession that lowers demand can flatten this trend.  In line with this positive outlook, I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has increased the quarterly dividend for the fourth consecutive year and I will now hand the call back to Malcolm. 
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Andrew. Rod, we will now open the call for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Andrew, let’s start with seismic here and on the one hand, the rhetoric and the message with respect to seismic in terms of visibility of revenue growth and customer demand being exceeding buoyant, is encouraging.  On the other hand, one would have expected that backlog would have been stronger quarter on quarter and I’m just curious as to what’s going on on that front. 
Andrew F. Gould: Why is your assumption that backlog is weaker, Bill?
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Well, it was flat, wasn’t it?
Andrew F. Gould: Marine. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Yes. 
Andrew F. Gould: Was down. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : No, no, but overall backlog of $1.2 billion -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry -- no, well -- it’s about the same as it was last year and it depends what your bidding tactic is. If you look at the number if inquiries to bid, there is no decline. In fact, there’s an increase. Are you following me, Bill? In other words, some people decide to bid first and some people decide to bid later. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : That I understand. Maybe asking the question differently -- what percentage of your fleet is basically contracted into 2008?
Andrew F. Gould: At this point, the available vessel months is probably about -- still available -- or booked vessel months is about 60%, available is about 40. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Okay, switching gears to North America, was the preponderance of the weakness quarter on quarter with regard to margins attributable to pressure pumping pricing?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Okay, and then going forward, if one assumes that -- and no doubt a difficult question to answer but I am going to try it anyway in terms of asking it -- assuming flattish drilling conditions in North America, relative to Q4 margins, what is a reasonable expectation for the evolution of margins as they unfold in 2008?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that’s a very difficult question to answer because we now probably have a reasonable outlook on what our portfolio is. We are flat out at lower prices and therefore it’s a question of how much operational efficiency and reasonable cost savings you can generated.  But I don’t -- all I will say is I don’t think you’ll see another precipitous decline -- I’ll probably regret this -- I don’t think you’ll see another precipitous decline from now on. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Okay, and so with regard to the evolution of your cost cutting and right-sizing of the business, is that pretty much behind you?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : Okay. Thank you very much, Andrew. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : Thanks and good morning. Andrew, for the Eastern hemisphere, margins were down. I understand mobilization issues and Mexico impacting Latin America. I guess the first question is two parts -- A, is there mobilization issues in Eastern hemisphere markets in Q4? And B, how should we think about mobilization impacting margins as we go into Q1 and ’08?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that the bulk of the -- I don’t think you should call it mobilization. It’s start-up costs rather than mobilization, Michael. I think the bulk of it was in Mexico, though we did also start up some projects in Russia. But on the scale of things, they were tiny compared to Mexico.  Going forward, yes, we still have rigs to mobilize in Mexico in Q1. We haven’t quite finished mobilizing those projects, so there will be some much less a degree I think of start-up costs in the first quarter. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : Okay, so much more consistent with what we’ve seen before Q4 in Mexico?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : Okay, and then secondly, Andrew, if I think about the interpretations that are likely to come out of this conference call, perhaps you could maybe mitigate some of that concern and give us a few lines -- just a bottom line of what you think the key takeaways ought to be. 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think the key takeaway is that as of today, worldwide 93% of the jack-ups are utilized, 97% of the semi-submersibles are utilized, and 100% of the drill ships are utilized. And the actual additions this year relative to the size of the total fleet are tiny, which means that offshore activity will be extremely vulnerable to rig moves, any dry docking -- anything that impacts the operational efficiency of the fleet and therefore, as I put in the comment, the scope to grow offshore in ’08 is relatively limited.  The scope to grow onshore is still fairly unlimited but as we all know, mobilizing projects onshore takes a long time. You only have to look at the delays we’ve seen in some of the Eastern Hemisphere countries in the last year to realize that the extent to which activity is going to increase is going to be good but it’s not going to be great.  North America I really don’t think I have to make any more comments about and then finally, if you look at the number of exploration licenses that have been let to us in the last three years all around the world, you have to believe that seismic is going to be very strong again.  So overall, I see 2008 as a transition year into a cycle which is going to be dominated offshore because I don’t know whether you follow the numbers but the number of offshore rigs on order in the last quarter of this year increased by 14. So you have this huge wave of 160 offshore rigs for delivery from now through to 2011.  So this, Michael, for me is a transition year. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : Okay. How about technology penetration in ’08?
Andrew F. Gould: Well actually, I think that the strongest element of our portfolio in 2008 which uses a little bit of everything of what we do is going to be IPM and then the classic technologies will still, I think, and everything to do with DDMWD, LWD continue to be very strong. And wireline will shift gradually towards more exploration and well services will wait for a recovery in Canada and the U.S. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : Great. Thanks, Andrew. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. Just to follow-up on the last question, IPM becoming a driver in 2008, does that mean that there will be some margin pressure, given that IPM tends to have a lot of third-party revenues booked? Fairly good from a cash flow but as we model margins, they should maybe be a little bit lower? Is that the right -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Yeah, actually we are going to do a study on that in the first quarter and decide how we disclose it to you. Because as you rightly point out, as IPM grows, it becomes a significant portion and if you remember once before we did actually tell you what revenues were at that level, so let us do a study and if we think it is really material information, we will make a disclosure. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay, that would be helpful, I think. Also, looking at your CapEx for the oilfield in ’06, it was 50% up in ’07. We grew by half that and in ’08, you are guiding to about half that growth again. Does that reflect that your business is becoming more mature or is it a low point in ’08? Is 13% really sustainable to justify that kind of growth -- 
Andrew F. Gould: I think that there was an awful lot of catch-up in the previous we years and actually, seismic is increasing hugely and it will be even higher in ’09. And the other segments, it’s quite difficult to make a balance at this point in time but there could be a re-acceleration in ’09. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay, that makes sense. Finally, on the offshore rigs coming in, I mean, you do see quite a number of jack-ups coming in -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Yeah. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: -- a little delayed but still, any assumptions on market share loss within your caution on the effects of these rigs?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, a lot of these rigs don’t have contracts yet. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Well, assume that they will go to work, given where rates are, so I don’t think they will be sitting on the beach when you are getting $180,000, $70,00 for a jack-ups. 
Andrew F. Gould: Well they won’t get $180,000 or $70,000 for jack-ups. A lot of our customers are waiting for them to be idle to tender. I don’t see why you are talking about loss of market share though. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Well, Brazil for example in the direction drilling, although you [quoted that] for completion. I was wondering -- 
Andrew F. Gould: That’s one contract. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Well, thank you very much. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Andrew, the question I have for you is parsing through your comments here as you talk about the complex near-term, you obviously give one potential negative on North America, or a negative on North America, potential negative on offshore and then two positives. Do you think in aggregate those, the positives completely offset the negatives, or is there a little bit more risk on the negative side?
Andrew F. Gould: I think I’m trying to say that I still think that in the -- while there will be extremely healthy growth outside North America, there is still a slight assumption that it’s going to -- maybe I’m wrong but a lot of people are assuming that it’s going to be a bit better than I think in 2008. It’s a specifically 2008 event. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay and then getting some kind of feedback from certain investors and clients about a perception of the margins peaking for your business, I think predicated on your outlook for exploration and technology, how would you counteract that argument that your margins have kind of peaked and they might not improve from here?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that I would say that the purely demand led pricing has peaked but as the cycle moves more towards exploration, complex offshore developments, there is no reason why we shouldn’t see our margins reassert themselves. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Dan Pickering with Tudor & Pickering.
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: I would like to focus on your commentary in the press release and I think you said it several times here today -- shorter term growth presents a more complex picture. Does that mean you think for the next couple of quarters we are actually slower sequentially? And if that’s the case, is that a domestic or an international or a seismic commentary, or is it some combination of the -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Sorry, by slower you mean negative, Dan?
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: Yes, that’s correct. 
Andrew F. Gould: I think the only risk of negative is still in North America. Internationally, the growth will be there but it may be a bit slower than some people are assuming. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: And I guess my takeaway from the call is basically you feel expectations are a little high and so, I mean, over under for revenue growth internationally is 15% year over year, something like that?
Andrew F. Gould: I just think there are some people out there, not everybody, whose expectations for international growth are a little too bullish, Dan. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: I would anticipate that’s going to change after this call. I guess the other question I have is as we look at -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Sorry, can I just say 2008 -- international growth 2008 and then people need to go back to the offshore story in 2009. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: I’m with you. Okay, and then as it relates to North America, I’ll follow-up with Malcolm just to try and understand the numbers, but I want to hear you say it -- the other businesses, if we looked at wireline or directional or LWD, et cetera, any softness in pricing or activity or share for you guys?
Andrew F. Gould: I am limiting my comments to land, okay? I am not talking about offshore Gulf of Mexico. There is minimal price weakness -- and when I say minimal, it’s compared to well services -- in wireline and everything else is growing very nicely. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Geoff Kieburtz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Maybe I wrote it down wrong, Andrew, but I seem to remember from last quarter’s conference call that you said something along the lines of international growth in ’08 will be at least as great as it was in ’07. Are you revising that or was I just wrong?
Andrew F. Gould: I don’t think I ever said that, Geoff. We’ll have to look at the transcript, but if I did, I’m surprised. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: That was not your -- 
Andrew F. Gould: It may have been limited to -- I would have made it in the context of certain markets but not in every market. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: So as we look at what we now know to be the international growth in ’07, it is expected to be overall somewhat slower in ’08?
Andrew F. Gould: ’08 will be slower than ’07 in international markets overall, yes. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay, and your comment on North America not having another precipitous drop. Was that a margin or a revenue comment?
Andrew F. Gould: Margin. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay. And could you just share kind of how you are thinking about the somewhat obviously increased risk of a U.S. recession? Your comment at the end of the press release is one that you’ve made before about only a global economic recession. How are you thinking about that in the context of managing Schlumberger?
Andrew F. Gould: Our planning assumption is that the famous coupling will not take place, at least this year, and therefore any drop in OECD demand for oil and gas will be more than offset or will be countered by the increase in India, China, and the Middle East to a point that it will not affect the oil price to a level where our customers will seriously curtail their plans. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay, so you don’t put a very high risk probability on that scenario for ’08?
Andrew F. Gould: On the U.S. recession, I -- I mean, personally, I think we’re there. On the coupling with the Asia and the Middle East, I just somehow don’t think so. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Ken Sill with Credit Suisse.
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Thank you. You guys are so careful with your outlook comments and us simple-minded sell-siders are very focused on numbers. So obviously international growth is still good, not as good as last year but it was really phenomenal last year. But we are still talking probably in the teens for overall international growth in ’08, is that fair?
Andrew F. Gould: That would be a reasonable assumption.
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then I guess the big question is margin assumptions or incremental margin assumptions, right? So when you say that some people seem to be a little bit too bullish on their expectations, I guess what I’m reading into is there’s some guys on consensus that seem to be a bit high, one of those came down this week. But are you concerned with overall expectations reflected in estimates in stock prices or just for the people that are kind of out-layers right now?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I’m not -- you know, I don’t -- 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: You don’t give specific guidance, I know that, but I was just -- 
Andrew F. Gould: I am concerned that generally the assumption on the level of international top line growth is too high, and you just said it. It’s no longer what it is in ’07. It’s coming down to somewhere in the teens and that I think is a fair assumption.  Does that mean there will be degradation in overseas margins? I don’t really think so. We obviously won’t have the same capacity for incremental margins that we had at 30% growth when you are in the teens. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: So when you are looking at overall margins in ’08, if you look at international margins, you would expect those margins to be at least where they were this year or do you think they will actually be better in ’08, because -- 
Andrew F. Gould: You are going too far, Ken. I think that -- I’m not going to give specific margin guidance either but I don’t think there’s any reason to assume that we can’t maintain the margins we had in ’07. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Okay, and we’ve already asked about IPM. I guess the one specific question I’ve got and then I’ll give up is obviously in seismic, you had huge margin swings based on vessel utilization, on mobilizations and downtime. Is there -- because margins swung from 32% to 38% or whatever they were doing -- is there kind of an average margin, do you guys think? Or could you possibly give us a little bit better guidance in the future on the -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, it’s pretty difficult because it’s almost impossible to understand what the margin is going to be until you know the nature of the multi-client sales you’ve made in the quarter. It’s not so much marine. I mean, marine when you have transit or dry docks, you get hurt badly because you can’t cut costs for the two weeks you are in the dry dock or wherever it happens to be. But the thing that really you are unable to predict is the swing in multi-client margins given the age of the elements of the portfolio you might or might not serve in any one quarter. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: So overall, WesternGeco should expect nice growth and more dramatic in ’09 as you put more vessels -- and is it fair to say that pricing in seismic is actually still improving? 
Andrew F. Gould: Marine seismic pricing is still very buoyant, yes. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: So in line with the margins you are talking about everywhere else, we shouldn’t expect a degradation and possibly better but who knows?
Andrew F. Gould: Right. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: That’s what happens with multi-client. Okay, well my view based on your comments this quarter versus last quarter is you are actually fairly confident about where things are going and seem a little bit less bearish on North America. Is that -- am I reading that correctly or am I just putting my own wishful thinking -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think -- I am going to repeat this again. I think expectations on international growth were too high and I think North America, I’m not saying the market is turning around but we have better visibility on ’08 than I had in the last quarter and it’s going to stabilize somewhat. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Dan Pickering with Tudor & Pickering.
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: Back again -- Andrew, I just want to clarify; you’ve talked a lot about expectations for growth. Has the actual international outlook deteriorated in the last two or three months?
Andrew F. Gould: Sorry, wait a minute, Dan -- you are going to have to qualify that by telling me what period are you talking about?
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: Okay, so you are saying 2008 expectations are too high. 
Andrew F. Gould: Internationally. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: Internationally and the question I’m asking is from your perspective, have those markets for 2008, have they changed to the down side in the last couple of months? In other words -- 
Andrew F. Gould: From my perspective, no. There is no change whatsoever. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: Okay, so we’ve got a Wall Street expectations issue. We do not have a business is getting worse issue. 
Andrew F. Gould: Absolutely. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: Okay. All right and then final question, seismic, the vessel moves, I guess I was a little surprised because in Q2 we had moved a lot of things around. We had a lot of down time and then we hear about it again here in Q4 and did some markets soften up so we had to move -- 
Andrew F. Gould: No, Dan, there is a summer market and a winter market. The summer market is a very high-priced market in the North Sea and the winter market is a lower priced market on the coast of Africa, in the Mediterranean, et cetera. So you get vessel transits in the second quarter of vessels moving up to the North Sea and then the third quarter and this year in the fourth quarter, because everyone stayed in the North Sea as long as they could, you get the reverse. 
Dan Pickering - Tudor & Pickering: Okay. All right. Thank you. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Brad Handler with Wachovia Capital Markets. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: A couple of different things, I guess, coming back to some of the same questions but if you could help us understand in the U.S. stimulation market, presumably the pricing has rolled over with respect to contracts and that process would apply to more of your customer base in perhaps 1Q and 2Q, so there is some additional pricing pressure that’s offset, perhaps by cost efficiencies and volume? Is that the right way to think about the stable outlook that you are presenting?
Andrew F. Gould: I think when I say that we know more about North America in 2008, I am saying that because we rolled over a fairly high percentage of our contracts already and therefore we have a better visibility of where we are going.  And as you point out, the risks that remain are the prices at which we renew contracts that have not been renewed and the efficiency of our cost containment measures. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Fair enough. Just as a follow-up to that, I’m just curious about pressure on recently renewed contracts you may be experiencing from your clients, just them coming back and saying I hear pricing is continuing to drop and what else can you do for me. Have you found any re-opening like that?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, yes, there is always some but it’s not huge at this point in time. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: All right, that’s helpful. Switching gears, just -- interesting and maybe I just missed something, but interesting comment about the relationship with TGS-NOPEC on that one client survey. Could you give us a little color on how that came to pass and whether that’s something we should, the partnership is something we might look for in the future?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think the partnership will be opportunistic in as much as if we have a common interest in investing in a survey, we’ll do it together. I think you have to -- I don’t know how you follow the seismic business but TGS has had some issues in a proposed merger and they probably badly needed some boat capacity. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Okay, so that was that -- you’re presenting it as something they may have reached out to you -- is that how they always run their -- 
Andrew F. Gould: -- it was an opportunity for both parties to get the shoot done. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Next we will move to the line of Douglas Becker with Banc of America Securities. 
Douglas Becker - Banc of America: I just wanted to touch base on the international margins. You said they were somewhat stable or are expected to be somewhat stable going forward but in the fourth quarter we did see them trending down, implying incremental margins were going to be a little bit lower.  What are the dynamics that allow margins to be stable in the international markets in ’08?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I actually didn’t say they would be stable but I tried to point out that the events in the fourth quarter that affected international margins were largely either seasonally weather related or related to the mobilization or start-up costs with IPM projects and therefore with the exception of U.S. land pressure pumping, were somewhat exceptional in nature.  So the question that I was asked earlier is on revenue growth that is considerably lower than 2007, can you maintain margins and overseas and generally, I said yes. 
Douglas Becker - Banc of America: Understood. And then just on the Gulf of Mexico, was the weakness that we are seeing weather related in the fourth quarter completely recovered -- in the third quarter, rather -- was that completely recovered in the fourth quarter?
Andrew F. Gould: No, only the -- the rigs only got really back to work at the scale they were before the third quarter in December. 
Douglas Becker - Banc of America: So potentially some upside from fourth quarter level to -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Yeah, not huge in the Gulf of Mexico in ’08 but there is some, yes. 
Douglas Becker - Banc of America: Thank you. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Michael Urban with Deutsche Bank.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: I know you are sick of talking about it at this point but yet another question on North America. You’ve been somewhat negative for quite a while now and that’s obviously turned out to be correct. Now seeing some stability but maybe reading too much into your comments, as people often do. But what you seem to have taken out of there is a longer term bullishness with respect to activity levels driven by decline rates out there. Do you think we’ve, just by your actions, at least, I’m wondering if you think we’ve maybe turned a corner or created some kind of base level of production, or maybe it’s your concern about recession but I’m just wondering if that has changed. 
Andrew F. Gould: Are you talking specifically about North American gas?
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Yes, North American gas, yes. 
Andrew F. Gould: I think we are at a level that can probably sustain the current level of production for some time. So I don’t think that’s the case in Canada. I think that ’08 is a plateau year.  I cannot say that I am optimistic on ’09 yet because as you know, so much depends on storage, how much LNG gets diverted to the U.S. this year, et cetera. But I think the rig count is at a level where it can sustain the base level of production we have. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Okay, so to be absolutely clear -- a flat rate count in the U.S. to sustain production?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Okay. That’s all for me. The rest of my questions were answered. Thank you. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of David Anderson with UBS.
David Anderson - UBS: I have a question on your Russian business -- according to our analysts over there, they are projecting the major producers to increase spending by about 17% in ’08 and then moderating a bit in ’09. As the largest service company over there in Russia, does that taint your views on the spending growth rate over there, particularly how you see that trending over the next couple of years?
Andrew F. Gould: I think that to fulfill their ambition of increasing production 2% a year, I find that figure a little low, the 17%. I would anticipate that if they maintain their objective of increasing oil production by 2% a year, they will spend more. 
David Anderson - UBS: How linked do you think that is to the tax regime on the upstream companies? My understanding is that the tax regime is pretty onerous over there so they are not really incentivized too much. What do you think the likelihood of that changing is and do you think that’s kind of the key to opening that market up a little bit further for you guys?
Andrew F. Gould: I think that the Russian oil industry is just as sensitive to tax as anybody else and they have this profit, this tax on everything above $26 or $28 a barrel. And I think that the government will -- if it -- I think the government authority understands that if it needs people to invest more, it is going to have to raise that ceiling and I suspect it will get raised.  Do you think that’s an ’08 proposition and is that impacted by the election or -- 
Andrew F. Gould: I’m not an expert on Russian politics but I think people understand and it will happen. 
David Anderson - UBS: Okay. A different subject, you talked about a $5 billion backlog in IPM work. Considering that probably most of that is probably in Latin America, I assume you are already shifting capital down to that market, like you’ve sent much of the start-up costs.  Just wondering if the [Toupi] discovery kind of changes your plans. I guess in other words, will you be shifting even more capital down to that market in advance of expected higher activity levels in that region?
Andrew F. Gould: I think that the [Toupi] discovery is not an IPM prospect but in terms of the overall level of activity in Brazil, I suspect that given the delivery of new rigs, it’s far more an ’09 phenomena than an ’08 phenomena. 
David Anderson - UBS: Okay, but you will be shifting more capital down there though?
Andrew F. Gould: Oh yeah, absolutely. 
David Anderson - UBS: Okay. That’s all for me. Thank you. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Jim Crandell with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers : A couple of questions; first of all, Andrew, to follow-up on the international E&P spending outlook and I’m relating it back to my survey but it shows growth in international spending of 16%. If you look at past years where you’ve had a very high oil price environment, typically beginning of the year budgets get revised upwards, so it seems to me we could be looking at a year of international spending growth, let’s just say of 20%-plus like we saw in 2007.  I believe on the last call you said that you would think that your revenues internationally would grow faster than the rate of international E&P spending internationally. 
Andrew F. Gould: The only distinction I would place on that, Jim, is whether that spending is on land or offshore, and to the extent that it is more to -- if it was offshore, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in saying we would grow faster than the spend. But I fear a lot of it is on land in 2008, whereas you know our revenue or the service intensity per rig is not the same. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers : Would you be disappointed if at the end of the year, looking at your revenue growth internationally and it was in the teens, if your three major competitors on average all showed meaningfully higher international revenue growth? Now granted they are coming from smaller bases and I understand that but do you think that it is possible that you may grow at a meaningfully lower level than your three major competitors internationally?
Andrew F. Gould: I would be very, very disappointed. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers : Okay, that’s good to hear. I would hope you would be. Just switching gears to a strategic question, would you be interested in buying relatively new U.S. stimulation equipment on a reasonably sizable basis and either moving that equipment internationally or consolidating it into your domestic suite?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, a lot of the equipment that has been built in the U.S. is not going to go international because it is not suitable. But no, I suspect for international we would build our own. Small amounts of equipment that might become available in the U.S. in distressed circumstances we would certainly look at and I stress small. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers : Okay, good. And my final question is certain of your competition is alleging on recently very large IPM contracts in Mexico that you have been bidding very aggressively, much less than on prior phases of that same contract and presumably at lower margins because they are now certainly more interested in bidding on IPM work in that market. Comments on that?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I would suspect I know exactly what bid you are talking about and I would just remind them that we have had an infrastructure in place for 10 years and therefore our cost of operation is probably much very different from theirs. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers : How about though the relationship -- if I’m pronouncing it right, it’s something like [schecontepak] three but relative to two, which is comparable size, that you are bidding something like $250 million less on the entire project. 
Andrew F. Gould: To my knowledge, there is no outstanding bid on [schecontepak] at this point in time. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers : Okay. That’s what I had. Thanks. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Robin Shoemaker with Bear Stearns.
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Just a couple of quick questions -- I know you are going to do a study on the IPM issue and can you just remind us now on your IPM project, the range of revenues that come from third party, which might be as low as X percent and as high as Y percent, just to give us a little bit of a sense there is, what that number -- 
Andrew F. Gould: I would say that they can be all the way from 10% to 50%. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Okay. All right. 
Andrew F. Gould: For example, we don’t necessarily own the rigs we use and therefore we contract rigs from drilling contractors and therefore obviously the whole rig rate would fall into third-party revenue when we bill it on the customer. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Sure. And integrated project management as a percentage of your international revenue, where are we now looking at this year?
Andrew F. Gould: I haven’t actually calculated it for 2008 but we are somewhere between 10% and 15%, I would say, including the Schlumberger services. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Okay, one further question -- on Eastern Echo as you acquired six vessels and we saw your certainly your rationale reasoning for expanding the fleet, when you looked at the total vessel expansion, seismic vessel expansion, Eastern Echo plus others, did you come to the conclusion that there were not enough vessels overall being built to meet demand or how does that work out in terms of the total expansion of the seismic vessel fleet, given that we have found ourselves in the past with overcapacity in this arena?
Andrew F. Gould: Actually, we evaluated all the potential acquisition candidates in the seismic field and there are two elements here. One is the number of vessels and the other is the time to market and our calculation assumed the price we pay for Eastern Echo, the price to complete the vessels, and the availability of them would mean that the financial returns would be very satisfactory.  So we weren’t actually thinking in terms of total market. We were thinking in terms of how we could expand our own fleet. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Okay, and the total market size you expect to grow?
Andrew F. Gould: We are more and more confident that there will be no issues with marine utilization in 2009 or 2010 and certainly I think the large players, ourselves and PGS and CDG, all have enough 20-year old vessels to mitigate the situation if that turned out not to be true. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : Andrew, a quick follow-up -- I just want to make sure that there’s clarity on this revenue and margin talk for ’08. Clearly on the international side, talking somewhere in the teens for revenue growth. On the issue of margin, I think when people think growth in IPM or a higher IPM mix, we think lower margin. That’s not what you are saying, correct? Year-on-year?
Andrew F. Gould: No, what I’m saying Michael is that the degree of third-party revenue that we have from the IPM contracts is growing and therefore, we are going to do an exercise to look at whether or not we disclose that to you every quarter in such a way that you can assume that that has a lower margin than the Schlumberger services and therefore you can make some adjustment.  I mean, I’m assuming that the Schlumberger services, be they to IPM or anybody else, we can produce satisfactory margins in 2008 compared to 2007. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : Okay, and so when we think of mid-teens -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Overseas, sorry -- overseas. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : So when we think of teens revenue growth, would that be including or ex IPM?
Andrew F. Gould: It would be including IPM. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : Lastly, with a decelerated growth in international and capacity growth on a part of a lot of your competitors in those markets, are you concerned at all about a capacity overshoot in this year of transition of ’08?
Andrew F. Gould: I think that, because as I tried to point out in the third quarter, capacity overshoots will be in local markets and not general. That’s why -- actually, that’s one of the reasons I used the work complex. In other words, market intelligence is going to be very important in 2008. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan : Thank you. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of William Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil: Thanks. My questions were answered. 
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next move to the line of Rob MacKenzie with FBR. Please go ahead. 
Robert MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Thank you. Andrew, a couple of quick follow-up questions from before -- in the press release, you mentioned a three-year wireline logging contract for Petrobras. Can you give us a feel for how much of their future business that encompasses?
Andrew F. Gould: I hate getting into these discussions of individual contracts but it’s one of the largest contracts we ever signed. 
Robert MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: And so, with [Toupi] in mind, that would imply that it represents a fairly large share of their future business?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, yeah. I think it’s -- you know, the size of Schlumberger is such that it is not any one contract in any one country that is going to move the needle for you guys. But in as much as there is a big expansion of Petrobras’ offshore rig commitments in 2009, yes, it will turn out to be a very big contract. And it may or may not be [Toupi] -- it may be other fields. I’m not actually aware of what their drilling plan is. 
Robert MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay, fair enough. And then another service you guys recently introduced, or have been doing some jobs with is the StimMAP live service, real-time FRAC monitoring. That’s got to be fairly small so far but it’s an important play. Can you give us a feel for the growth potential of that technology, and perhaps even leading to market share gains and stimulation for you guys?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that is -- so you are quite right to point out at the moment we have actually not a great deal of capability to do it real time, because the difference here is the fact that you are doing it in real time and therefore, you can have people monitoring the FRAC propagation and changing the job as they frac. So it’s more I think a function now in 2008 of how many crews we can field to do that. And I know there’s a substantial increase but it’s coming off quite a low number, and will it improve the quality of what we do and therefore allow us to capture market? Yes, I suspect it will.
Robert MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay, and then the last question before I turn it back is coming back to the TGS-NOPEC joint venture in the Gulf of Mexico, you guys are contributing the vessels, the Q technology. What is TGS bringing to the table? I’m a little bit unclear on that. 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, TGS is bringing to the table the fact they had a great deal of pre-commitment from customers for this survey and the fact that they have a much larger sales force than we do.  And as I said, it’s opportunistic, it makes sense to do it. You shouldn’t read anymore into it than that. 
Robert MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. The last question we’ll have time for comes from the line of Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak. Please go ahead.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Thanks, and I’ll try to be quick; Andrew, I was a little surprised at the extent of the implied start-up expenses on the two Mexican contracts. With IPM getting larger, is that something that we’re going to need to factor in when we make our quarterly assessments?
Andrew F. Gould: Well, I think that if it’s in a new area, as the Mezosoico and Alianza contracts are because they are in south Mexico, not in the north. We mobilized 17 large drilling rigs, they are not small, in six months. You can assume there are going to be start-up costs.  So you know, when you see a large project, you should assume some degree of start-up costs, particularly if it’s in an area where we are not already working. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Okay, and then second, the seismic quarterly earnings pattern, this is the first time in a while that 4Q was below 3Q. Is that likely to be the pattern going forward with marine becoming so important now relative to multi-client? Or is this -- 
Andrew F. Gould: -- is quite difficult to tell because as I said earlier, what happened this year was a lot of the North Sea -- the North Sea boats which normally move in Q3 actually moved in Q4. So I can’t -- I wouldn’t be able -- I can’t give you an honest answer on that now.  What we will do I think is give you better information going forward when we know about dry docks and transiting. But we were caught by surprise by these late moves this year. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Okay, and I guess one last thing, which you probably won’t answer but on the contracts that you signed for stimulation in the U.S. ’08 versus ’07, is pricing down in the double digits?
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, the low double digits -- just scratching the double digit. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.: Thanks a lot. That’s it for me.

Operator: Welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. (OperatorInstructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, VicePresident of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead. 
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Julie. Welcome to today’s third quarter 2007 conference call. Beforewe begin today’s call, I’d like to review the logistics and agenda. Some of theinformation in today’s call may include forward-looking statements, as well asnon-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other importantinformation are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request.  For today’s agenda, Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer, will begin withcommentary on the financial results; then Andrew Gould, our Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer, will provide an overview of the third quarter activity andoutlook. Finally, we’ll take questions from the audience.  Now Simon Ayat will discuss the financials. 
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentleman, good morning and thank you forparticipating in this conference call. Third quarter net income was $1.09 pershare, up $0.07 sequentially, and $0.28 above the same quarter of last year.Oil field services generated $1.5 billion in pre-tax operating income; flat withthe second quarter but declined in margin terms by 108 basis points to 29.4%.  By area, the highlights were as follows: North America pre-tax margindeclined 427 basis points sequentially, to 26.9%, due to weather-relateddisruption in the Gulf of Mexico, the continued erosion of pressure pumpingstimulation pricing on land in the U.S., and a reduction of explorationactivity in the Alaska, partly compensated by a rebound in Canada after thesecond quarter spring break-up. Latin America pre-tax margin increased 10 basispoints sequentially to 23.7%, reflecting the improved margins in the Mexicoand Central America, and Peru,Colombia, Ecuadorgeomarkets. The improvement in the Mexicoand Central America geomarket was a result of thecontinued ramp up of new IPM projects that more than offset the projectsstart-up costs.  For ECA -- the Europe, CIS, Africaarea -- the pre-tax margin improved 50 basis points sequentially to 29.2% with Russiaexperiencing a seasonally high offshore Sakhalin,and on land in Eastern Siberia, and a strong performancein the North Africa geomarket. This was partly offset by project delays inthe Caspian and Nigeria,and Libya wheremargins came under pressure. Middle East/Asia pre-tax margin increased 38 basis points sequentially, to35.7% on improvement in China,Japan, Korea,Australia and New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Indonesiageomarkets, with continued exploration activity, while margins in the Middle East geomarkets remained steady. WesternGeco’s pre-tax income was$306 million, with a sequential margin improvement of 611 basis points, to38.6%.  Marine margins improved with the introduction of the seventh Q vessel,higher utilization following the seasonal transit and dry docks in the previousquarter, and better prices. Dataprocessing also improved as a result of increased activity associated with themarine operations. This was partly offset by slower multi-client sales, mainlyin North America.  Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole; the effective tax rate was 20.8%,1.5 percentage points lower than last quarter, mainly due to the lowerproportion of pre-tax earnings in North America for both OFS and WesternGeco.  Four quarter ETR is expected to be slightly higher than the current quarterlevel, and will continue to be impacted by the geographic mix of earnings. Theearnings for the quarter included $32 million of expenses related tostock-based compensation, as compared to $34 million in the previous quarter.We expect this expense for the full year 2007 to be approximately $135 million,a $21 million increase over 2006.  As of September 30, net debt was $1.7 billion, significant liquidity events duringthe quarter included $293 million for a stock buy-back program; CapEx,including multi-client, of $790 million; and funding of the U.S.pension by an additional $150 million. CapEx, excluding $72 million of multi-client surveys capitalized, was $718million for the quarter and is expected to reach approximately $3 billion forthe year 2007. During the quarter, we bought back 3.1 million shares for $293 million, atan average price of $93.62. This brings the total share buyback under the 40million share repurchase program announced in April, 2006 to 24.1 millionshares for $1.6 billion at an average price of $66.93 per share.  Now I turn the conference over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould: Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. Growth in the third quarter wasdriven by international activity across a number of geomarkets in Latin America and in Russia,as well as by activity in China/Japan/Korea, Indonesiaand the Gulf in the Middle Eastern/Asia area.  In North America, activity increased in Canada,but this was offset by weaker pricing for pressure pumping on land in the U.S.,and by a sharp revenue drop in the Gulf of Mexico, dueto the departure of several rigs to overseas locations, and a loss ofapproximately 15 operating days due to weather.  Among our technology, growth was strongest at WesternGeco as the segmentrecovered from dry docks and vessel transits in the second quarter. Marineacquisition revenue for the quarter reached an all-time record, as pricing firmedand advanced Q technology acquisition techniques continued to be deployed. Inother technologies, growth was led by robust IPM activity and by demand for wirelineand drilling and measurements services, particularly in overseas markets.  Looking at the areas in more detail, within North Americasequential revenue in the Canadageomarket rebounded on a higher rig count, led by demand for well services and wirelinetechnologies, following the seasonal spring break up. However, this was morethan offset by slowdowns in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as operators adoptedprecautionary measures during the hurricane season, with the approach ofvarious weather systems; and by capacity-driven pricing erosion in pressurepumping stimulation services in all three U.S.land geomarkets. Lower exploration activity and seasonal maintenance in Alaskaalso contributed to this reduction.  In Latin America, sequential revenue growth wasprimarily driven by a continuing ramp-up in integrated project managementactivity; although the higher rig count, together with stronger demand fordrilling and measurements, artificial lift systems; and Schlumberger’sInformation Solutions Technologies in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador geomarket, alsocontributed to growth. In Europe, CIS and Africa,sequential growth was driven by a strong performance in Russia.This resulted from a number of positive factors that included seasonally highactivity on land and offshore in East Russia; increaseddemand for IPM services and artificial lift products in South Russia;higher demand for drilling and measurements technologies in North Russia; as well as the impact of the consolidation of Tyumenpromgeofizika. Elsewhere in the area, increased demand for new technology, drilling andmeasurement services in North Africa, higher artificiallift product sales in continental Europe, and higherwireline activity in West and Southern Africa also droveresults. Overall sequential growth, however, was tempered by project slowdownsin Nigeria andin the Caspian.  Within the Middle East and Asia,sequential growth resulted from higher activity in the China/Japan/Korea, Indonesia,Australia/Papua/New Guinea, India,Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines and Gulf geomarkets. This was partially offset bylower activity in Qatarand the Thailand/Vietnam geomarket.  Advanced technology uptake continues as demand for new wireline technologieswas driven by the need for more accurate formation evaluation. New wirelinescanner deployments included high-pressure, high-temperature applications inthe U.S. Gulf of Mexico used for thin bed and laminated sand analysis in the U.S.and West Africa, and for evaluation of additionalnatural gas production in Mexico.Worldwide Scanner jobs have now exceeded 1,500 with more than 300 tools activethroughout the geomarket organization. Drilling and measurement scope services also continued their worldwideexpansion, with PeriScope imaging while drilling jobs in China, and TeleScopehigh-speed telemetry in combination with StethoScope formation pressure welldrilling technology on operations in Qatar, Brunei and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The shift towards more complex operations was highlighted during the quarterby a number of technical successes. Deeper reservoirs with consequent higherpressures and higher temperatures were logged with advanced high technologyservices, while new contracts were signed for deepwater projects in severalregions.  IPM strengthened as the new Mexican projects ramped up. Current projectspassed important milestones and geographic expansion increased in growingmarkets in newer regions. Among the more active projects, IPM operationsincreased in geomarkets in the Europe, CIS and Africa;while the contribution made by the well construction business in Latin Americangenerally continued to grow.  Turning now to WesternGeco, marine acquisition revenues increased throughhigher vessel utilization, following the seasonal transits and scheduled drydock inspections seen in the prior quarter. In addition the seventh Q vessel, theWestern Spirit which was launched in Q2, was fully active. Strong demand formarine seismic also led to improved pricing for both conventional and Q marinesurveys. Among the other WesternGeco products lines, data processing increased,driven primarily by higher sales in Europe, North America and Asia, while land activityremained flat and multi-client declined.  In the immediate future, while there will be some recovery from the lowactivity levels in the Gulf of Mexico, natural gas activity in both Canada andthe U.S. is likely to stabilize as production remains relatively strong and gasstorage approaches winter at comfortable levels.  As a result, pressure pumping pricing deterioration will continue. Thissituation, however, does not change our view that North American natural gassupply will require sustained activity to combat production decline, andadvanced technology to increase production rates from poorer qualityreservoirs. Overseas, growth will continue at varying rates between regions, due to theeffects of winter weather and project delays in certain countries.  Global demand for oil remains strong, while non-OPEC production continues todisappoint. Production decline rates in mature areas and continuing projectdelays will inhibit non-OPEC supply increases; while personnel and equipmentshortages will restrict the industry’s ability to respond.  Within this context, we see continuing demand for oil field services,products and services that help our customers sustain their current production,while adding reserves through new exploration. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Andrew. We will now open the call for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from James Crandell – Lehman Brothers.
James Crandell – Lehman Brothers: Andrew, I would like to start with a question about your favorite business, U.S.land stimulation. How much do you think your prices, on average, are down to-date?How much further do you think they go; and what sort of annualized rate do youthink that U.S.stimulation capacity is growing at currently?
Andrew Gould: I will take that question in three parts. So far I think pricingdeterioration is still single-digit compared to last year. I think it willaccelerate slightly in Q4. Where the bottom is I really don’t know, becausewhat we have is a situation very different from 2001, in that the bottom is going tobe created by additional capacity and not by a drop in the rig count. Because Iused the word stabilized quite consciously, in that we think at the currentlevel of storage, with the current production profile, rig count is likely toremain flat or go up or down a little bit, but basically not change very much. So what is going to change the pricing profile is the additional capacity. I’m not quite sure where we stand in theadditional horsepower that was coming on. But, you know, when we looked at it afew months ago, it was certainly an increment in the high teens, if not more. 
James Crandell – Lehman Brothers: Could you elaborate on your statement of project delays in certain countries?You mentioned Nigeriaand Caspian in your comments. Are there any more areas, and what is the magnitudeand timing of these delays as you see it now?
Andrew Gould: I think that in the case of Caspian, it’s unknown. I think in the case ofother countries, it’s really just a question of logistical difficultiesbecoming more and more complex and therefore perhaps the rate of growth thatpeople have been expecting from certain countries, while the growth will bethere, it’s not going to be quite as fast as they imagine. 
James Crandell – Lehman Brothers: In particular the two areas that I mentioned, Nigeriaand Caspian, or would other areas fall into that as well?
Andrew Gould: I think there are other areas as well but those are the two that well, inthe case of Nigeria,logistical difficulties make it difficult to see the rate of growthaccelerating at this point in time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael LaMotte – JP Morgan.
Michael LaMotte – JP Morgan: I’d like to follow up on the comment that Libyacame under pressure. Can you talk about what specifically happened in thequarter and then maybe provide some outlook on North Africain general?
Andrew Gould: I think that Libyais suffering from what the previous FedChairman called irrational exuberance. In other words, I think, for example, ifyou take the number of wireline trucks in Libya,it has probably been multiplied by four in the last year.  For the logistical difficulties that I was just mentioning with Jim, the rigcount is not followed, so you have huge overcapacity limited to that country atthe moment; but which means that everyone’s margins are under pressure. 
Michael LaMotte – JP Morgan: How does that all shake out as we go into ’08?
Andrew Gould: I think it depends on the rate at which the Libyan activity increases; but Libyais a country where logistics are difficult, so I don’t think the rig count isgoing to increase as fast as perhaps people have projected. I think it’ll take longer in ’08 to sort itout.
Michael LaMotte – JP Morgan: Andrew, as you look into ’08, what would you say are the greatest challengesthat Schlumberger and the industry face? You’ve mentioned logistics a few timesnow. 
Andrew Gould: I think the constraints on logistics -- and it’s really an end of ’08problem -- but the idea that the industry is going to ramp up 146 offshore rigsin a period of 18 months without a considerable loss in drilling efficiency isquite difficult for me to imagine. So, I actually think ’08 is a year when wewill continue to have very strong growth in traditional land markets but offshoregrowth is going to be limited by the number of new rigs coming on to the marketin the first three quarters. But logistical and crane difficulties, for allsorts of things, are getting more difficult, in my opinion at the moment,rather than less difficult. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Herbert – Simmons. 
Bill Herbert – Simmons: Multi-client sales off, down quarter on quarter and I think down year over yearas well. What’s going on in multi-client in the Gulf of Mexico?Do we think we’re amply supplied for the time being, or is this just atemporary period of stagnation? 
Andrew Gould:
 :
Bill Herbert – Simmons: Secondly, with respect to the contraction in North American margins, about430 bips, what percentage of that was driven by the Gulf of Mexico?
Andrew Gould: A very high percentage.
Bill Herbert – Simmons: A very high percentage. 
Andrew Gould: Because you understand that these stand downs, you can’t reduce cost in anyway because they’re for two or three days each time. 
Bill Herbert – Simmons: I understand that. That’s mostly, I would imagine, a transitory affair andyou should recover some -- if not most of that -- into the fourth quarter?
Andrew Gould: In the Gulf, yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets. 
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: The question I have for you is your comment here about personnel andequipment shortages impacting the industry’s ability to respond. I’m assumingyou’re talking about the oil industry’s ability to respond to grow production.I’m curious about the equipment shortages. Is that a situation where theservice industry may be short on equipment and therefore may have the abilityto really start to push pricing up at this time?
Andrew Gould: I don’t think you should take my comment as relating purely to whatSchlumberger does. I think you should take it as relating to the whole chain;in other words, the capacity to build platforms, surface equipment, flow lines,everything else that you need to complete a project. Actually, as I justmentioned to the previous question, the story of when we get more offshorerigs.  So, I don’t think you should take that comment as being limited purely towhat Schlumberger does; it’s across the whole spectrum of what the industryneeds to do a development project.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: In the context of that question, is this kind of like a funnel effect whereyou get a lot of projects and oil companies trying to get a lot of things done,and they’re limited by that equipment? Does that give the oil service industry inaggregate the ability to get better pricing?
Andrew Gould: Overall, across time, yes. I think that the oil companies will be cautiousnot to allow excessive inflation to be built in by all bidding for the sameresources at the same time. So, if you like, it supports what I’ve told youbefore, that we think the growth period will go on for longer; but it may getspread out.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: You referenced a couple of issues that we should be cognizant of in terms ofproject delays and some of these rig issues and so on. Does this alter yourgrowth rate viewpoint, where you had a high teens revenue better than that earningsgrowth rate through the end of the decade?
Andrew Gould: If you exclude North America, no. Actually, what Iwanted to get across as well is that Russiais now so large for us that the seasonal effect of winter weather in Russiawill have an effect on Q4; particularly as Q3 is the highest quarter becausethat’s when Sakhalin is really in full swing. I wantedto just get across that we have another weather effect that perhaps peoplehaven’t looked at before.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: But you especially continue to be confident in the international growthrates being at or above that high teens rate in North America,is really the question?
Andrew Gould: North America is the question.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley. 
Ole Slorer– Morgan Stanley: You mentioned that pressure pumping deterioration and the margins in North America were down quite a bit sequentially in the quarter. Couldyou give us some idea of where contract pricing for the industry now, for morecommoditized- type services are, relative to the sort of pricing that wasrealized in the third quarter?
Andrew Gould: If I can just, perhaps point out, Ole, as I said in reply to the previousquestion, that the biggest effect on margins in the Q3 in North America was the lack of operating days in the Gulf of Mexico due to precautionary evacuations, not from land. There wasa deterioration on land but it was not the major part of it. In terms of thepricing of services, other than pressure pumping, we have not so far seen a noticeableeffect.
Ole Slorer– Morgan Stanley: But my question was, where is pricing right now in pressure pumping relativeto the pricing that was realized in the third quarter?
Andrew Gould: Well, we’re only 17 days into the fourth quarter and I don’t know, is theanswer to that. 
Ole Slorer– Morgan Stanley: I’m not asking for the fourth quarter, but where they stand now.
Andrew Gould: I said in answer to a previous question that we felt that it would continueto deteriorate and perhaps be at a slightly higher rate in the fourth quarterthan the third.
Ole Slorer– Morgan Stanley: You mentioned production declines in the metro areas. Could you be a littlebit more specific in terms of at what level you think non-OPEC productiondeclines, how you highlighted this a year ago and there was a very bearish oilmarket sentiment that you said that non-OPEC was way too optimistic and allthat. You reiterated it now, it has sortof played out. Can you help us a littlebit with how to think about what decline curves are? We are hearing anythingfrom 8% to 15%?
Andrew Gould: I’ve never given a public answer to this question, and I’m not going to. I use a figure that was used by one of ourmajor customers a few years ago, which was 8%. Now whether that’s acceleratingor not overall I think is an open question. What I do think is that a lot ofthe forecasting agencies are still using decline rates that are inferior tothat, which is what leads to the confusion. 
Ole Slorer– Morgan Stanley: One final question. Seismic capacity is there lots under construction there,particularly out of the Norwegian companies? When do you think that astandardized 3-D seismic contract pricing will peak? Are we one or two or threeor four years away from that?
Andrew Gould: Well it is certainly not in 2008, and after that I really don’t know, Ole.It depends. Every one of these boats so far has been three to six months lateand as you know, we have azimuthal shooting growing at the same time which usesmore boats, and exploration spend. It’s certainly not in 2008; but at whatpoint beyond that, I don’t know at this stage. 
Ole Slorer– Morgan Stanley: Electromagnetic; are you commercial now? Can you give us one final bit ofupdate on that a little bit for me?
Andrew Gould: Well, we are certainly commercial on magnetotellurics and yes, we arecommercial on CSEM as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup. 
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup: WesternGeco margins were very robust. Are they sustainable?
Andrew Gould: Well, if you exclude the seasonal effects of vessel transits in marine, theyare sustainable and in multi-client, yes, I think they’re sustainable. So theanswer overall is yes. There may be quarterly fluctuations, Geoff; but overall,yes. 
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup: So if we look at what might be an ’07 average margin for WesternGeco, youthink that that’s sustainable on a coupleyears out at least until maybe the effect of the --
Andrew Gould: I think so.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup: Just to clarify, your prior comment on the multi-year growth in the highteens, you’ve modified that to exclude North Americanow?
Andrew Gould: Well, I said through the end of the decade. What I’m saying is that we won’tget a high teen growth rate in North America in 2008.Everywhere else, we probably will not be that far from it; but in North America we’re not going to get it. Now what happens through theend of the decade, I can’t speculate yeton North America specifically. The rest of the world,I’m perfectly confident. 
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup: If I’m not mistaken, your previous comment about high teens growth throughthe end of the decade --
Andrew Gould: Did cover everything, yes.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup: Did cover everything. Are you kind of backing away from that a little bitnow?
Andrew Gould: I’m saying I have an uncertainty on North America, butnot from the rest.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup: On North America, we saw basically a pretty bigdecline; I understand the Gulf of Mexico impact.Overall, do you think that the North American EBIT contribution in ’08 is goingto be above, below or in line with the ’07 contribution?
Andrew Gould: Well, I don’t think I’m ready to answer that yet Geoff. Obviously, if thereis a big pricing impact on land, then it will have an effect.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup: So a decline is a possibility?
Andrew Gould: It’s not excluded, no. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Ken Sill – Credit Suisse.
Ken Sill – Credit Suisse: I wanted to follow up on that last one and make sure I’m hearing what you’resaying, which is; you said in your early comments that you see North America isgoing to need more activity over time to maintain production?
Andrew Gould: Yes.
Ken Sill – Credit Suisse: But you don’t know what’s going to happen in ’08?
Andrew Gould: No. I have indicated that our feeling is that in ’08 on land, given thecurrent position of gas, a stable or slightly fluctuating up or down rig count isprobably our most likely scenario. In those circumstances, the additionalcapacity in pressure pumping will undoubtedly having a pricing effect,mitigated somewhat by the need for more technology to produce better frompoorer quality reservoirs.
Ken Sill – Credit Suisse: But long term, you still see growth in revenues in North America?
Andrew Gould: On land?
Ken Sill – Credit Suisse: Or just North America, yes.
Andrew Gould: Yes.
Ken Sill – Credit Suisse: To follow up on a previous question, somebody had asked how much do youthink pressure pumping demand is growing ex the rig count in North America?
Andrew Gould: That’s a difficult question to answer because there are two types ofpressure pumping. There is the basic, which is probably not growing any moreand then there is the staged stimulation of horizontal wells that is probablystill growing quite fast. So the indicator should be the number of horizontalwells that are being drilled for gas, as opposed to straight vertical wells, orhorizontal wells with staged completions.
Ken Sill – Credit Suisse: Is that something the commodity guys can do or not?
Andrew Gould: Not necessarily, no. 
Ken Sill – Credit Suisse: On the Gulf of Mexico, how much of a decline isrelated to what appears to be a long-term decline in shallow water activity andrigs moving versus deepwater? How much do you expect to see rebounding here inQ4?
Andrew Gould: Well, I don’t think that the shelf has a huge effect either way for us. Weshould at least recover the operating days we lost, which was 15 roughly, inthe deepwater. 
Ken Sill – Credit Suisse: So that was really just a deepwater issue from the rig advance?
Andrew Gould: For us, yes. 
Ken Sill – Credit Suisse: One final question. Your long-term contracts have generally been two tothree years, so is there another year of margin improvement related to oldcontracts rolling to higher prices coming in ’08? Or will it be more --
Andrew Gould: I would remind you it’s only one-third of the contracts that will roll, soI’m not prepared to speculate on that at this point in time. We’re not faralong enough in our planning cycle for me to see. But generally, I don’t seeany reason that there would be any material deterioration in overseas margins. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: When you look at the growth in Latin America and the rig reduction in theGulf of Mexico in the US, is the Latin America market heading toward becoming amore important region overall globally for you? You’re the biggest in that area.
Andrew Gould: Well, we are the biggest but I certainly think that there is an awful lot ofgrowth potential left in Latin America, yes.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: When you talk about the improvementsthere, is it mostly on straight demand or is it mix of services? Are they sortof joining the technology revolution, if you will?
Andrew Gould: Well, like everybody else, what they have to do is getting more complex; soyes, they are more and more interested in technology.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: From the technology adoption standpoint, the vehicle to do that, is thatmostly through IPM for you?
Andrew Gould: No, I would say Latin America is equally some verysophisticated customers, and IPM.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: If you looked out further, can you see this region moving towards the samemargin as the other international regions over time?
Andrew Gould: Well, it will always have the effect of the huge body of IPM contracts andthe third-party passthrough revenue that we have to recognize; which is atlower margin than our own services. 
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: The last thing is more of a longer-term growth question here. You remain prettycomfortable with the longer-term growth outlook. When you look out beyond ‘08, howmuch of the growth in the business going to be dependent on the delivery of thenew rigs?
Andrew Gould: Well obviously the size of the increase in the offshore rig count is a veryimportant factor in our growth beyond ’08, particularly as it migrates todeeper water and more and more complex reservoirs. 
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: When you look at your growth rate out that far, and if there was anopportunity for these to slide to the right, so to speak, does that affect yourgrowth outlook or does it make you feel less comfortable with your growthoutlook?
Andrew Gould: No, because we have always considered that there would be an element ofslippage in the delivery of offshore rigs and therefore we've taken that intoaccount in our thinking. I am sometimes worried that The Street hasn't.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: It's this thing you were talking about earlier about taking longer, but thedemand is still there, it just takes longer to materialize. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: How much impact have you seen from stimulation equipment moving out of North America and into the Russian market?
Andrew Gould: The real impact of that was when Canadawent down, and the Canadian companies moved fairly aggressively into Russia.I would say that was half one phenomenon of this year and since then, things havepretty much stabilized. I was in Russialast weekend. We still see frac fleets arriving in ones or twos but they'renothing that the market can't cope with. There's not the influx that there wasin the first half of this year.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: Demand is again outstripping the supply?
Andrew Gould: I would say it is pretty balanced at the moment.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: The Canadian market obviously recovered a bit seasonally. Would you expectmuch more than what we've seen right now, again given the gas fundamentals in North America and also the potential impact of tax and royalty changesin Alberta?
Andrew Gould: I think it's a very difficult call to make, and I don't think until we startto see a significant production decline we're likely to see a significant changein spending levels. I would imagine that this Q1 will be better than the lastQ1, but it's not going to be like 2006.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: So you may go positive on a year-over-year basis, simply because it's notgetting any worse rather than getting better?
Andrew Gould: Yes. It's getting better. I really don't know what the effect of thisroyalty thing is going to be.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brad Handler - Wachovia. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Could you please just update us in terms of IPM orders and backlog? You gaveus some statistics last quarter; I was just hoping you could give it for 3Q.
Andrew Gould: It hasn't substantially changed since the end of the last quarter in termsof a solid backlog. In terms of enquiries and ongoing negotiations I would sayit has increased and it's shifted considerably away from Latin America. It's far more in Europe, CIS and Africaat the moment than in Latin America. But there's not asignificant shift in the overall backlog this quarter.
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: I guess it was at $4.8 billion as of 2Q and it's more or less there, you'resaying? There was some offset relative to the revenue.
Andrew Gould: Yes.
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Could share your thoughts on the Mexican market? We've heard a lot aboutsome very large tenders which are potentially up and coming in '07, and yetthere are still budget constraints that you think drift into '08. Your thoughtson that please?
Andrew Gould: Well, I think there are still a considerable number of large tenders thatwill come out in 2007. I haven't personally heard of any budget constraints,but I can't claim to be up to date to the minute. There certainly are one ortwo or three very large tenders that are still likely to happen.
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: In '07, you think?
Andrew Gould: In '07, yes.
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Can you share your comments related to that in terms of interest? ObviouslyChicontepec is a key area but are there some others on land which are also afocus for you?
Andrew Gould: I really don't want to go into that. But yes, we are still interested inexpanding in Mexico.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Kevin Simpson – Miller Tabak. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: Andrew, two questions, maybe more quarterly oriented than you might want toget. The first would be that normally your Europe/Africa region sequentiallygoes higher in the fourth quarter, but your suggestion that Russiais big enough now that the seasonal influence made you mention fourth quarterspecifically. I am just wondering if we should expect 4Q comps for that region notto go up as they normally have done in 4Q?
Andrew Gould: Well as you know, that region really has two markets that are highlydependent on seasonality. One is the East and Central Russiawhere there will undoubtedly be a winter effect because people just shut down.The other is the North Sea, which is extremely weatherdependent, and the North Sea I really can't call, becauseI think people will go on drilling if the weather allows them too.  So overall, I think that the weight of Russia-- and the North Sea by the way -- in the total ofEurope/Africa is likely to perhaps moderate the effect you are talking about inthe past, Kevin. It increased in Q4 over Q3.
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: I just wanted to go into one quick follow up on multi-client. I would havethought with the strength of the lease sale that you would've seen strongermulti-client sales for third quarter as people got prepared for it. So I wasjust wondering how that all played out and it sounds like you sound prettycomfortable that you're going to get actually a fourth quarter rebound there.
Malcolm Theobald: Yes, well don't forget that the lease sales concern different parts of theGulf, and we think that the upcoming lease sale in October is probably moreprospective for a lot of multi-client than the one that was in Q3. So, yes,we're pretty confident.
Operator: Your next question comes from Pierre Conner – Capital One. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One: My question is a direct follow on to that on the multi-client side. I wonderedwhat your perspective of future multi-client sales would be, given the contextof available multi-client wide-azimuth and E-Octopus data. Do you feel therecould be a move toward some of this other data that would impact currentlibrary sales?
Andrew Gould: What other data are you talking about, Pierre?I'm not quite sure what you mean. Do you mean are the E-Octopus sales indecline?
Pierre Conner - Capital One: No, from the standpoint of available multi-client wide-azimuth data, willcustomers tend to move to that or wait for wide-azimuth data and therefore notbe accessing the current library of non-wide-azimuth data?
Andrew Gould: I'm not sure there are enough wide-azimuth multi-client out there to reallyaffect libraries yet. It may come, but not yet.
Pierre Conner - Capital One: That's fair. Related to E-Octopus, can you remind us of how much impact isthere in the current quarter in WesternGeco from the earlier phases, 1 through3? The fourth and fifth phases don't get kicked off until first quarter.
Andrew Gould: No. I'm very comfortable in saying I don't know, Pierre,I'm afraid.
Pierre Conner - Capital One: Switching gears on a follow up then back to pressure pumping. You mentionedabout a single-digit still decline in pricing and I'm wondering if you coulddissect that a little more, Andrew, relative to more sophisticated technologyand more commodity types.
Andrew Gould: Not really. I think it's in more uncertain geographical regions than others,which is a reflection of how you see the U.S.land rig count move in different areas. I don't think that where pressurepumping is being used in conjunction with staged completions that we've seenany pricing decline at all. But that's still a fairly small portion of theoverall market.
Pierre Conner - Capital One: In the past you have given us a specific impact due to delays from stormstandbys and wondered if you've done that calculation on an EPS basis? I knowyou told us the majority of the North American margin compression was due tothat, but have you run through that specifically?
Andrew Gould: No, it's 15 days so you can assume it's more than $0.01.
Pierre Conner - Capital One: I'm assuming also as per what you described in the supplemental is that mostof the tax delta -- essentially all of the tax delta -- was due to geographicmix change?
Simon Ayat: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob MacKenzie – FBR.
Rob MacKenzie - FBR: Andrew, my question is for you. You mentioned the first two StageFRAC jobsoutside of the U.S.in this market; one in the Mexico/Central America market and one in Saudi Arabia. Can you give us a feel for how muchpotential there is for expansion of StageFRAC in these and other markets andwhat the timing might be on that?
Andrew Gould: There's huge potential. We've done jobs in West Africaas well. It's really a question of the normal cycle of time it takes to spreada technology overseas which, as you know, is quite long. But there is a hugepotential overseas.
Rob MacKenzie - FBR: Separately, also in the FRAC, you did a job with Flex Stem in the North Sea. Is this something that you are seeking to potentially replaceFRAC vessels with to reduce cost structure, or is this more of a niche product?If you could help us get a feel of how many more you might be building, theultimate size, same thing with the question on timing as well?
Andrew Gould: Well, I know we are looking to applying that idea in other theatres. I wouldsay it's more a solution to deal with the marginal demand. In other words,where you cannot afford a whole vessel or the market cannot support the wholevessel, and where the marine operating conditions allow you to use that sort ofpackage you can deal with the marginal demand much easier than a full-fledgedsteam vessel.
Rob MacKenzie - FBR: How would you characterize the opportunities for that around the world?
Andrew Gould: I would rather not in public, if you don't mind.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Pickering – Pickering Energy Partners. 
Dan Pickering - PickeringEnergy Partners: Andrew, I'd like to come back to the international markets for a second. Youtalked about Libyawhere capacity additions have changed the market dynamic a little bit. 
Andrew Gould: No, not a little bit, Dan; completely.
Dan Pickering - PickeringEnergy Partners: Okay, completely. I'm trying to extrapolate across the internationalmarkets. Do you see general overcapacity in any of your product lines?
Andrew Gould: No. This is a very particular case where the opening of Libyaled everyone to believe there would be, I think, an immediate bonanza, sopeople shipped in equipment at a rate far faster than the increase in rig countwas taking place.
Dan Pickering - PickeringEnergy Partners: So just to be clear, we shouldn't be thinking there are too many LWD toolsin the market, or too many wirelines in the market?
Andrew Gould: No, no. And in fact, I would exclude LWD from this argument even on Libya.
Dan Pickering - PickeringEnergy Partners: Then back to North America a little bit. You'vetalked a lot about pumping. I was confused by one of your answers. It soundedlike you said the pricing impact in pumping had not yet had a margin impact.Was that correct?
Andrew Gould: What I said was that in the drop in our margins in Q3 in North America, the effect of the hurricane stoppages or the precautionarystoppages in the Gulf was by far the largest part of our margin decline.
Dan Pickering - PickeringEnergy Partners: As it relates to the pumping business, can you talk to us and strategicallyhelp us understand, are you a market share defender in North America?Are you taking capacity out? How do you fight your way through a market withtoo much capacity?
Andrew Gould: I think you should assume that everybody is a market share defender at themoment.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael LaMotte – JP Morgan. 
Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan: First on the buy back, Andrew, I have to say given the swoon that the stockshad in August I was a little surprised that you didn't buy back more. Is thereany thought or comment there?
Andrew Gould: No. At these levels, they are on a very regular program, Michael.
Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan: So more programmatic than opportunistic?
Andrew Gould: Yes. Maybe we missed a tactical opportunity, but we didn't see the run up.
Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan: Secondly on currency, currency issues have come up in the past and we'vetalked about the business being dollar neutral and revenues and costs beingvery much dollar linked. The question I have is more to cost of livingadjustments for ex-pats that are being paid in dollars. Is there any risk wecould see some real inflation in wages next year for those kinds ofadjustments?
Andrew Gould: I think you have to take into account there are two types of ex-pats. Sothere are ex-pats who rotate. An example would be WesternGeco crews or testingcrews who actually live in a country where they pay their bills in euros orpounds or whatever it happens to be, and we have always based our salaries indollars. For those people, over the last two years, we have already been makingcost-of-living adjustments to take account of the devaluation of the dollar.  Then you have our permanently assigned expatriate personnel who live in thecountries where they work and who are paid in dollars and remunerated on a basesalary and on a cost-of-living coefficient -- all in dollars -- and thatpopulation, if there continues to be a serious decline in the dollar, we willhave to address it, yes. Yes, that will cause a little cost inflation.
Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan: Can you give a sense in terms of the mix of employee base?
Andrew Gould: Not off the top of my head, Michael, no, but the vast majority are in dollarterms.
Operator: Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: You mentioned, Andrew, that you had always factored in some delays in termsof rig deliveries in your rig outlook. Can you give us some idea of averagedelay versus the stated delivery dates that you've been using?
Andrew Gould: Actually that's not the one I worry about. I think the operating efficiencyof a rig in its first year with a new crew, new out of the shipyard, is vastlyinferior to an existing offshore rig that has a well-honed crew and has beendrilling wells for years. So it's not so much the delay from the shipyard asthe actual drilling efficiency in the first year or two of operations.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Would you be using like a 50% factor or like an 80% factor?
Andrew Gould: I don't think we're that scientific about it, but it would be a prettysubstantial factor, Geoff, yes.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: The second one was in your comments about Europe/CIS/Africaand the greater size of the weather and seasonal dependent markets. All otherthings being equal, will the potential declines in the fourth quarter causemargins to vary significantly? I mean, there's a mix effect kind of implied inyour comment.
Andrew Gould: Significantly, no. Very, yes. But not the sort of thing you've seen with theGulf of Mexico stoppages if that is what you are thinking, Geoff.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: So it would be negative but not very large.
Andrew Gould: No. If you take Sakhalin as it's a seasonal shutdown,we can adjust cost accordingly.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: So you can anticipate, right?
Andrew Gould: It's when you get a stoppage where a stoppage is unforeseen or brief thatyou cannot adjust cost that you get the accelerated market effect.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: I guess what I was asking perhaps was whether those more seasonal of marketstypically carry higher margins than the average for the region or lowermarkets?
Andrew Gould: That would probably be a fair statement.
Operator: Your final question comes from Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers.
Jim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Andrew, our data is showing that non-North American CapEx on E&P thisyear will be up close to 25% in '07. Assuming that you believe it, do youbelieve that '08 growth over '07 can be as strong as '07 versus '06?
Andrew Gould: The announced CapEx numbers?
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: I am just saying that based on our survey and then adjustments to our surveysince it's come out is showing growth of close to 25% in '07. I'm asking youwhether you believe that or not, I guess, do you think that '08 versus '07 willmatch that, exceed it, fall short of that, in terms of a global growth rateoutside of North America?
Andrew Gould: I actually suspect that it will at least match. Now what is the inflationcontent in that 25% in '07, I don't know how you measure that. What it will bein '08, I don't know either, but I would not be at all surprised if the rawnumbers match or exceed.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: What do you see as the regions that could grow faster than 25%?
Andrew Gould: I think Latin America and parts of the Far East and Russia.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: You have your three major competitors internationally all in various stagesof building up their IPM or bundled services capability. They've all ramped upCapEx. They've all ramped up infrastructure spending. They have a lot of newtools and services entering into the market.  In markets that you've dominated technically or because you just have verystrong shares historically, what kind of issues does this create forSchlumberger? Do you still believe that technically speaking you're as farahead of the competition as you've ever been and doesn't really create anysignificant challenges?
Andrew Gould: Obviously having more capacity on the ground creates more challenges. Justbecause people have put equipment there doesn't mean that they can operateefficiently. There is obviously more threat than there used to be. Do we feelmassively under threat? Not at all.
Operator: We'll turn it back to Mr. Theobald. Please go ahead.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time then, I’d like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir. 
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Kent. Welcome to today’s second quarter 2007 conference call. Before we begin today’s call, I’d like to review the logistics and agenda.  Some of the information in today’s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. For today’s agenda, Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer, will begin with commentary on the financial results. And then Andrew Gould, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the second quarter activity and outlook. Finally, we’ll take questions from the audience.  Now, Simon Ayat will discuss the financials. 
Simon Ayat: Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon and thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter net income was $1.02 per share, up $0.06 sequentially and $0.29 above the same quarter of last year before charges, $0.33 after charges.  Oilfield Services generated $1.5 billion in pretax operating income, reaching a pretax margin of 30.4%, a sequential improvement of 90 basis points. By area the highlights were as follows: North America pretax margin declined 21 basis points sequentially to 31.2%, due to the seasonal spring break-up in Canada and erosion of the pressure pumping stimulation pricing, which was largely compensated by strong exploration-related activity in Alaska, increased deepwater drilling offshore in the Gulf Coast, and service intensity combined with a slightly higher rig count in U.S. land.  Latin America pretax margin was 23.6%, sequentially up 118 basis points, reflecting improved margins in Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago and Peru, Colombia, Ecuador geo-markets, partially offset by higher project start-up costs in the Mexico geo-market.  For ECA, our Europe, Africa, CIS unit, the pretax margin improved 43 basis points sequentially to 28.7%, with Russia rebounding after the seasonal winter slowdown and sustained exploration activity in the North Sea further augmented by strong performance in the North Africa geo-market.  Middle East, Asia pretax margin increased 103 basis points sequentially to 35.3% on improvements in the Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, China, Japan, Korea, and East Mediterranean geo-markets with increased activity. Specifically, a boost to exploration efforts across Asia and the Middle East while margin in Arabian and Gulf geo-markets remain steady.  WesternGeco pretax margin was $216 million, a deterioration of 525 basis points sequentially to 32.5%. Multi-client margins declined. There was a seasonal slowdown in sales, particularly in North America while marine margins improved as pricing and vessel production gains more than offset the impact of increased transits and scheduled dry docks.  Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 22.3%, 1.7 percentage points lower than last quarter, which is mainly due to the geographic mix of earnings. Both OFS and WesternGeco had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in North America and internationally, various geo-markets with lower tax rates contributed to greater percentage to pretax earnings.  Based on the projected geographic mix of earnings within OFS and WesternGeco for the remainder of the year, the full-year ETR is expected to be slightly lower than last year and above Q2 levels.  The earnings for the quarter included $34 million of expenses relating to stock-based compensation as compared to $37 million in the previous quarter. We expect this expense for the full year 2007 to be approximately $140 million, a $26 million increase over 2006.  As of June 30, net debt was $2.1 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $172 million for the stock buy-back program; CapEx, including multi-client, of $802 million. In addition, during the quarter, $396 million of series A convertible debentures were converted by holders into approximately 11 million shares of Schlumberger common stock. CapEx, excluding $61 million of multi-client surveys capitalized, was $741 million for the quarter and is expected to reach approximately $3.1 billion for the year 2007.  During the quarter, we bought back 2.2 million shares for $172 million at an average price of $78.20. This brings the total share buy-back under the 40 million shares repurchase program announced last April to 20.9 million shares for $1.3 billion at an average price of $62.90 per share.  Now, I turn the conference over to Andrew. 
Andrew F. Gould: Thank you, Simon. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Second quarter results were driven by the increasing pace of international activity with sequential growth for Oilfield Services accelerating in all areas except North America, where higher activity on land and in the Gulf Coast was not sufficient to completely offset a significant downturn in Canada.  Across all areas, demand was high for drilling and measurements, wireline, artificial lift and well services technologies, as well as for Schlumberger Information Solutions products and services. Oilfield Services pretax margin reached a new high of 30.4%, led by an exceptional performance in the Middle East Asia area due to continued favorable revenue mix from exploration services, particularly in Asia.  In North America, the U.S. land geo-markets recorded strong sequential growth due to higher activity and higher service intensity, particularly for well services, wireline, and drilling and measurement technology directed at horizontal wells in unconventional gas reservoirs. Further north in Alaska, demand remained high for exploration related services.  Growth was also seen in the U.S. Gulf Coast geo-market as the service mix returned more to drilling and measurements, well services and well testing following the shift to completion-related services seen in the first quarter. This positive performance was overshadowed, however, by the expected weakness in Canada that resulted from the early spring break-up and lower natural gas prices reflected in lower activity levels.  In Latin America, strong revenues were recorded as the remaining negotiations with PDVSA related to the [Presa] rig management and engineering contracts were concluded, enabling recognition of previously deferred revenue. This had only a marginal effect, however, on sequential growth in the area’s revenue and pretax operating income, which were primarily driven by demand for technologies, products and services across the area. The technologies that benefited included wireline, well testing and artificial lift in Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago; wireline, well services, well testing and information systems and completions in Latin America itself; wireline and IPM in Peru, Colombia and Ecuador; and well services in Mexico.  Sequential revenue growth in Europe, the CIS and Africa was driven by higher activity in the East Russia, Continental Europe, Libya and North Africa geo-markets. Demand was strong for exploration-related wireline, drilling and measurements technologies in the North Sea, and for well services technologies in North Russia. The North Sea and North Russia geo-markets also saw higher sales of artificial lift systems products, while completion product sales were higher in the North Sea. Growth was, however, moderated by seasonal weather effects in South Russia.  The strong sequential growth in revenue in the Middle East, Asia area was driven by higher activity in Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, [Ghata], Australia, Papua New Guinea and China geo-markets; stronger exploration-driven deep water activity in the Eastern Mediterranean; and higher demand for wireline completions and artificial lift technologies in the Arabian geo-market. But this growth was partially offset, however, by a lower exploration rig count in Thailand and Vietnam.  During the quarter, integrated product management saw increased demand for services in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and North Russia geo-markets. Since the beginning of the year, integrated project management has been awarded an impressive $3.8 billion of new and extended contracts that cover project management, technology deployment, and third-party services in the regions of Latin America, Russia, North Africa, Europe, and Malaysia. Building on long-term customer relationships, these awards have increased the contracted IPM through the end of the decay to a total of $4.8 billion. The achievement of clear performance objectives as part of the long-term nature of IPM services has been key to this expansion, where increasing market acceptance of the IPM business model can be measured by the continuing performance improvement that has been achieved over a number of successive contracts.  Turning now to WesternGeco, pretax operating income decreased sequentially in spite of the increased activity in marine acquisition and stronger data processing sales. Vessel productivity was higher than predicted in spite of seasonal transit and scheduled dry-dock inspections. These positive results proved insufficient to counter flat land revenue that resulted from the crew costs associated with certain projects and the usual seasonal decrease in multi-client data sales. As a result, the pretax operating margins dropped to 32.5%.  In order to meet the increasing demand for Q technology services, the seventh Q vessel, the Western Spirit, was launched at the end of the quarter. This vessel incorporates a development to the Q technology platform known as dynamic spread control system. This system automates vessels, source and streamer steering to achieve higher levels of performance. The benefits lie in far more accurate survey positioning to yield even higher repeatability in time-lapsed applications. The new vessel has already begun work for Statoil on a 40 reservoir seismic survey in the North Sea.  In another technology development, we acquired Geosystem land and marine electromagnetic and seismic imaging services. Geosystem has considerable expertise in the joint inversion of multiple geophysical measurements acquired through seismic, gravity, or magnetotelluric surveys, and it will become part of WesternGeco Electromagnetics.  In the short-term, the future natural gas activity in North America remains uncertain, as record imports of LNG, a slower-than-forecast decline in Canadian gas production, and the backlog of wells stimulated and brought online have all led to a rapid rise in gas storage levels. In this market, pricing erosion for pressure pumping stimulation equipment accelerated during the quarter due to increasing capacity. However, we continue to believe that the high decline rates of existing fields and the poorer quality reservoirs now being drilled would ultimately lead to renewed activity in the area.  Global demand for oil remains robust while non-OPEC supply continues to disappoint, due largely to acceleration in the decline rates of the existing production base, delays in new and complex projects under development, and inadequate industry investment from shortages of people and equipment.  We remain convinced that international activity will continue to increase as operators combat production shortfalls and continue to increase expiration budgets to renew reserves.  I’m now going to hand the call back to Malcolm. 
Malcolm Theobald: Thank you, Andrew. We will now open the call for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question this morning comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Andrew, with regard to the outlook for seismic, I was wondering if you could share with us what the pricing trends are at present on a leading edge basis. So for work that you are bidding into for 2008 and 2009, is pricing flat or up from where we have been? 
Andrew F. Gould: We still have some pricing leverage on the 2008 horizon. I’m sure you’ve noticed that some of the new builds have slipped. And also, if you add to that the popularity of wide-azimuth, which uses a lot of vessels, and general demand, we don’t see any capacity issues in 2008. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: When you make mention of pricing leverage, does that imply -- what magnitude of pricing increase are you guys getting, relative to where you are at present? Is it double-digits? 
Andrew F. Gould: I don’t know, Bill. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: Okay, and -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Quite deliberately, I didn’t ask, so I can’t answer your question. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: And then secondly, with regard to visibility, I’ve been struck by the fact that really size of backlog has been flat for about four quarters in a row now, notwithstanding the fantastic visibility going forward. Walk me through in terms of how sold out you are with regard to 2008, and are you beginning to bid for projects in 2009? 
Andrew F. Gould: So the answer is we are not in any way sold out in 2008. The only thing that’s happened as far as 2008 is concerned is that work that would normally have been bid at the end of the summer is being bid now. So we have visibility on a number of bids, if you like, but we don’t yet have visibility on the total backlog. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: Lastly, with respect to wide-azimuth, to date wide-azimuth projects have been I think only confined to the Gulf of Mexico. Are you optimistic that wide-azimuth is going to be exported to other spheres? 
Andrew F. Gould: We certainly think that in any arena where there are large salt bodies, that wide-azimuth will be tested. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: Which would be where? 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, it could be West Africa, it could be offshore India, it could be certain parts of the North Sea. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.: Thanks very much, guys. 
Operator: Thank you. We do have a question now from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. Andrew, you mentioned an impressive $3.8 billion of IPM work since the beginning of the year, and a backlog now of 4.8. This is something you’ve been talking about for a long time and marketing pretty aggressively, so could you give us a little bit of flavor on whether there are new types of customers that you are now seeing embracing this for one reason or another and elaborate a little bit on how this is being widened out and accepted in the markets? We all know about a certain country where it’s very ideal but to what extent is it getting wider acceptance and why? 
Andrew F. Gould: I think it is certainly getting a wider geographical acceptance than the initial concentration in Latin America. I think that it is being driven by a number of things. Firstly, I think it is being driven by our track record. Secondly, I think it is being driven by the fact that everyone is short of people and therefore short of people to manage their own projects and therefore if they can use an integrated project management offering to augment, to increase their own capacity to do work, they will do so.  And thirdly, there are certain types of operations where we have put together technical packages which allow us to market a technical package through IPM that is not otherwise available in the market. That’s particularly the case in Russia. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Is there any trend between IOCs or larger EMPs, or national companies that are now embracing this, or is it broad-brushed? How would you characterize it? 
Andrew F. Gould: I would say that every category you mentioned is using it in one form or another but the dominance is still through NOCs or relatively inexperienced exploration and production companies. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: I mean, 3.8 is a very big ramp by the sounds of things. Is this something unusual in this first-half or is this a -- 
Andrew F. Gould: When I say impressive, it is because we’ve never ever had a volume of work bid and won of that size in any period of time and certainly not in six months, so it is quite exceptional. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Just one follow-up question; you mentioned in Brazil you are doing the first CSCMI survey. Are you afraid in any shape or form of some of the patent allegations that are existing or do you think that you have protection on that front? 
Andrew F. Gould: We’re not concerned by any of the current patent claims that are made by any of our competitors. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Is this your first commercial survey now? 
Andrew F. Gould: No, but this is the first commercial survey with a new boat. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. We are going now to a question from the line of Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Thanks and congratulations on a great quarter. Andrew, I’d like to talk a bit about natural gas and the Middle East North Africa area. If I just look at Algeria, for example, they’ve abandoned their oil production target of 2 million by 2010. They are not spending any less. They are probably spending more though and getting more aggressive in terms of the incremental spend on the natural gas side. We’re seeing more capital in Saudi and Abu Dhabi and even Kuwait on the gas side. Can you talk about what that means from a P&L impact standpoint for your business and the region, how we can think about mix shift and -- 
Scott A. Greenstein: Firstly, I think you need to be careful to distinguish between investment in natural gas in North Africa and investment in natural gas in the Middle East. Investment in natural gas in North Africa is still very much attuned to an export market. In other words -- in the case of Algeria, as you’ve seen in the last quarter, that can be gas sold into the U.S.  And in the case of the Middle East, the increase in gas activity is being very much driven by domestic shortages of gas for their own industrialization programs. So you are quite right. We’ve seen a number of rigs diverted away from oil programs in several countries towards gas programs.  I would say that in the short-term, that really doesn’t make a great deal of difference to us in the P&L arena except for the fact that in some of the countries, some of the gas work that’s being done is gas exploration and therefore there is, if you like, probably a marginal quality effect on our revenue in the initial stages of gas development.  Also, a lot of the gas that’s being developed is either sour or at high pressure and high temperature and therefore requires a very somewhat specialized tools and therefore, some -- and also probably a greater degree of reliability and therefore probably commands a slight premium to the company that can provide them. But you are quite right to point out there is a general trend, particularly in the Middle East, towards more gas work but it is being driven by domestic shortages. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and so I guess just continue to watch industrial growth and GDP growth in the region I guess broadly for that. 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Secondly, can you help us characterize -- I mean, to be down just $0.01 sequentially in the North American region versus some of the other numbers that are likely to come out this quarter, can you characterize what it is in terms of what you are doing in North America that would lead to such differentiated performance? 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, you have to, as you well know, the service mix between us and some of our competitors is not the same and therefore, they are more or less affected by the drop in natural gas drilling in Canada.  As I pointed out last quarter, our people did an excellent job of downsizing and therefore, they got their cost base right very early on. I would actually say that the technology increment in non-conventional gas is increasing quite rapidly. This is true in well services but it is also true in drilling and measurements and completions. Therefore, with a relatively smaller exposure to the generic market, we are probably able to hold up a bit better. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Is it fair, I think in a commoditized or what has traditionally been a commoditized market like North America, we tend to see relative performance within the lens or through the lens of market share. Is it fair to say that this is really more about technology content than just raw market share points? 
Andrew F. Gould: I think it is fair to say that there is a trend where us and some of our competitors, not just us, are bringing technology to the non-conventional gas market that improves well performance but at the same time also protects the service industry to a certain extent from the pure generic hydraulic horsepower. 
Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. Thanks, Andrew. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. Andrew, just along the lines of a follow-up on your mentioning getting your costs right in Canada and North America in general. I just want to know if you have taken any additional steps to reduce your exposure in North America. With other companies doing the same, are you concerned? Are you starting to see any pricing pressures internationally? 
Andrew F. Gould: Additional steps in North America, we certainly haven’t moved any equipment. We have done some organizational fine-tuning in the second quarter but nothing like on the scale of what we did in Canada in Q4 last year or the beginning of Q1 this year.  International, yes, we’re seeing frac fleets arriving in Russia and certain other places. It’s had an effect on pressure pumping pricing in the Western Siberian market but not really anywhere else yet. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, and I also had a question here on the electromagnetic market and your what looked like a bigger entry into it, this acquisition. I just wonder if you could give us some general color on what you think the market size is for those services, its strategic importance and the technological differentiation Schlumberger may bring. 
Andrew F. Gould: I think we have always taken the point of view that the CSEM, or control source electromagnetic or magnetotelluric measurement on its own standalone was not really worth a great deal. I mean, yes, it allows you to pinpoint resistivity contrasts or to define bodies better, but unless it was constrained with other measurements, notably a structural measurement and the structural measurement is seismic and others like gravity and then further from that, the inversion of the whole model for reservoir properties -- the actual individual measurements on its own was not the end game.  Therefore, we’ve taken the point of view that you need to have the ability to make those measurements but the real value is in constraining them with each other and then making interpretations. And I think you’ve seen some of our seismic competitors make moves in the recent weeks which take you very much along the same line of thought. In other words, you need the measurement but it’s basically each measurement constraining the other that’s going to make the difference.  And what is the overall size of the market? I actually don’t think we know. I don’t think it’s anything like some of the numbers that have been tossed around but it is undoubtedly reasonably large. If you can produce a better image with some definition of hydrocarbon presence from constraining seismic with CSEM and other measurements, it obviously increases the value-added of the seismic you produce. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thanks, Andrew. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Crandell with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Congratulations, Andrew, and I’d also like to congratulate JF on his promotion, if he’s on the line. 
Andrew F. Gould: He’s here, Jim. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Congratulations, JF. I have a couple of questions and I’ll ask them both here and then listen to your answers on each of them. On the U.S. land stimulation market, first of all, Andrew, my question is capacity growth in U.S. land stimulation second-half versus first-half, companies like FracTech and Tritan still seem like they are adding equipment but others have stopped. Do you see a slowing in the rate of capacity additions here?  Secondly, do you think the combined effect of demand growth, retirements, the booming equipment internationally, will be able to offset the continued creep up in capacity and cause prices to stabilize soon?  Thirdly, how currently do you see prices on contract rollovers that will take place later this year for 2008? 
Andrew F. Gould: So on the first question, yes, we are aware that certain equipment orders have been cancelled. I don’t think we’ve seen anything yet that makes us feel that the reduction in new capacity is to the point where it is going to affect our original thinking on pricing in the second-half of the year.  Secondly, retiring equipment, moving equipment overseas, a gradual increase in activity in North America, when is that going to bring the market into balance and allow pricing to stabilize -- I have to say, Jim, I don’t know because so much depends on Canada. While I don’t think Canada will stay down forever, I can’t judge whether it’s this year or next that it turns back up. You’ve seen what the operators have said but operators can change their minds very fast.  The third thing in contract rollovers, we have seen price erosion in the second quarter more in the spot market than in the contract market, but if I was an operator I would wait for the second-half year to do my contract rollovers because there is going to be more capacity in the market, so I don’t think we know the answer yet as to how far or how much pricing could be hurt in the second-half. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: But you would think that rollovers -- in general, would you think would be lower pricing for ’08 versus ’07? 
Andrew F. Gould: That’s why they’re waiting. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Is that what you think? 
Andrew F. Gould: Oh, yes. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay, good. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Dan Pickering with Pickering Energy Partners. Please go ahead. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Good morning. I apologize, I’ve got a cold here. Andrew, as we looked at the second quarter, obviously very strong margins and I’m just wondering if there’s anything in the quarter that we should view as unusual or if this is kind of a new baseline as we step forward for the second-half of the year in terms of profitability -- any place where you would expect to see softer profitability in the second-half of the year? 
Andrew F. Gould: I think it would be unfortunate if you took MEA -- Middle East Asia -- as a baseline because the service mix -- very strong exploration campaigns in Asia means that the quality of revenue mix in Asia was exceptionally good in Q1 and in Q2 and I can’t promise that that will repeat every quarter. So I wouldn’t be surprised if you saw a little fluctuation up and down in Middle East Asia. I think in North America, I would love to think that the margin decline is over but given what I just said about pressure pumping, I would be amazed if it doesn’t drop a little more.  In Europe, Africa there is some seasonality effect in the margin improvement because you have Russia coming back, you have a very busy season in the North Sea which you know, basically only starts in the beginning of summer. But generally, I think they have the best chance of sustaining or improving still. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Okay, that’s helpful. I think you answered this question somewhat but can you help us understand the magnitude of Canada’s impact on this particular quarter? You muted it, it sounds like, with cost control but I’m just trying to understand how well the U.S. did based on what Canada did. 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, the Canadian rig count was down by 60% and sequentially -- just let me look at the sheet here. Sequentially, you are looking at a huge change in revenue, much more than the normal seasonal change. So the U.S. in fact did very well to make up for almost all of that. I would point out that I think even we were surprised by the strength of U.S. land and we were certainly -- we were helped by the Gulf Coast switching back more to a drilling mode than a completion mode and also the continuation of exploration activity in Alaska. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Andrew, do you think you took share in the U.S. in the quarter? 
Andrew F. Gould: I don’t think so, Dan, no. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Okay. Fantastic. Thank you. Good quarter. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question then from the line of Brad Handler with Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Thanks. Good morning. I guess I’m going to wind up touching on a couple of the same topics but I just want to be clear that I’m in the sense reading some of what you’ve written here correctly. Since you’ve listed U.S. land first in terms of sequential revenue increases, is it fair to say we’re talking about 15% or better sequential growth in U.S. land in the quarter? 
Andrew F. Gould: We didn’t say it was the largest. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: No, yeah, I don’t want to over read. I mean, you listed it first -- 
Andrew F. Gould: I think you are reading too much into it, Brad. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: All right. That’s -- I just asked if you would clarify that for me. 
Andrew F. Gould: No, we listed it first but it’s by no means the largest sequential increase, by no manner of means. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then if I switch gears to IPM, perhaps I could just ask for a little bit more detail with respect to a couple of the aspects. For example, can you share either the mix of third party services versus your own provision of services? And If you could comment on the progression, which I understand is a longer term progression but the progression of drilling versus production-related work. 
Andrew F. Gould: So there is no doubt that the progression in the $3.8 billion is very largely drilling work because that’s where people are really short of capability. There is some production but not nearly on the scale of the drilling.  In terms of the split between third-party revenues, project management revenues, and Schlumberger technology-related revenues, the ratios are roughly the same as they’ve always been. We will help you guys on that going forward for your modeling, as we did previously. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: If I could slip in one more, please; there has been talk out there with respect to your presence with partner [Valerik] with respect to intelligent pipe. I know it’s sort of a small topic but can you make any comment on your pending presence in that area? 
Andrew F. Gould: No, we are working with [Valerik]. I don’t think I want to make any comment on when we will be testing and offering. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Geoff Kieburtz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Thanks very much. I guess really the last question I had was if you could quantify at all the magnitude of the pricing erosion that you are seeing in the U.S. stimulation market, maybe what you are thinking it might be in the second-half? 
Andrew F. Gould: On the second-half, Geoff, I honestly don’t know. We have seen I think an acceleration in the second quarter to the point where I don’t know but I would estimate it’s close to double-digits -- not double-digits, but close to. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: You’ve mentioned before that a large fraction of your U.S. stimulation business is on contract. Could you just elaborate a little bit in terms of how does that work in terms of giving Schlumberger a differential protection against pricing erosion? 
Andrew F. Gould: I think that it’s fair to say that the pressure pumping companies who work on contract have a greater degree of protection in the first-half of this year and the difficulty that we will have along with some of our competitors who are also on fairly long-term contracts, is in the contract renewal in the second-half of the year. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: And typically, would you expect those rollovers to move to spot pricing? 
Andrew F. Gould: No, not necessarily. Spot pricing can vary even more. Spot pricing can go lower. If there’s no spot market, spot pricing can go even lower. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: And you made a comment that kind of surprised me earlier in regards to the increasing technological content of the unconventional reservoir development. Can you talk at all about how you see -- I mean, you are being reasonably sort of negative about the outlook for pricing but on the other hand, you seem to be saying that there’s some structural developments going on that are likely to offset that. 
Andrew F. Gould: No, I think there’s a segmentation in the pressure pumping market between those people who can only pump and people who can provide a completion solution together with their pressure pumping. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: And the relative size of the market from a demand perspective, that last category -- 
Andrew F. Gould: I think we’re proving, we’re in the process of proving that the technical solution which combines the completion with the pressure pumping adds value to the well, the non-conventional horizontal gas well. I think the market is quite small at the moment but growing quite fast. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay and just a clarification in terms of you talk about a backlog of well -- I wasn’t quite sure what you meant by a backlog. 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, as you know, the reason the spot market for stimulation has been so strong is that you have wells drilled and completed but waiting to be perforated and stimulated. So those wells, as they come online, they bring on new production even though they may have been drilled two months ago. So as long as there is a spot market for a backlog in stimulation, there is gas production behind pipe where the wells have already been drilled. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Is your sense that that backlog has increased or decreased over the last -- 
Andrew F. Gould: No, we think it’s decreasing at the moment. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay. Great, thanks very much. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Michael Urban with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Good morning. I wanted to jump down to Latin America and talk about Venezuela a little bit. You were able to resolve some of the contract issues down there and that helped the quarter a little bit. Going forward though it looks like Venezuela is going to need to ramp up activity, and there’s actually as we’re on the call here a story going across the tape about them cutting the original number of rigs but that actually implies a 50% increase from where they actually are.  Going forward, would you anticipate ramping up your activity there or bidding on new work, or are you taking a little more cautious view of the market? 
Andrew F. Gould: No, we are very happy, more than happy with our current relationship with PDVSA and we are perfectly prepared to invest if they invite us to tender for work. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Is that something that you are seeing, because again the rig count comments and we’ve spent a little time with them ourselves, would suggest that they -- now that they are kind of through the nationalization program that they are going to need to and in fact actually go ahead and start to ramp up work maybe in the second-half but certainly ’08. Is that consistent with -- 
Andrew F. Gould: We are certainly hearing talk of plans for a greater scope of work going forward, yes. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: But it hasn’t really translated into anything in terms of contracts or activity yet? 
Andrew F. Gould: For individual services, yes, but for large new programs, not really -- not yet, no. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Okay. That’s all for me. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Ken Sill with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Good morning, Andrew. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the IPM. You guys used to tell us about how big that was as a percentage of revenue. Is that something you are prepared to let us know now or something we should talk about offline? 
Andrew F. Gould: I think it’s something we’ll come to fairly shortly. We’re still sorting our way through all this before we decide how we formulate it for you because we want a formula for everybody that’s easy to understand. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: That’s fair enough. And then, I guess my question though, big backlog, I would imagine that’s going to flow through gradually but is that because the [pass] are going to start putting some pressure? Maybe your growth is a little bit better than we were thinking but the margins come in a little bit lower? 
Andrew F. Gould: Certainly in Latin America there will be some acceleration of the growth and to the extent that a large part of it is third-party services, there may be some slight overall margin reduction but there’s certainly no problem with the profitability of the Schlumberger services included. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Because it seems like you’ve done really well here in the second-half. International is doing quite well on a year-over-year basis, so is there really any change to your guidance from say Q4, Q1 of 20% plus top line growth and low 40s incremental margins? Or is it -- 
Andrew F. Gould: No, no, I think we just feel a lot more comfortable about it. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Okay, so no change. 
Andrew F. Gould: Not really. I mean, I would say the uncertainty there in my mind when I talk about that overall top line number is not overseas. It’s what happens in North America. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: And then a final question on seismic and multi-client. We’ve got a couple of lease sales coming here in August and October. Are you guys seeing a lot of activity related to those lease sales and do you expect a multi-client to pick up substantially in Q3? 
Andrew F. Gould: Let me just say that we think that second-half seismic will be better than first-half seismic. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Well that’s pretty good. Thank you, Andrew. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Alan Laws with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. 
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: Good morning. Exploration service integration kind of continues to be a theme through the quarterly reports. Just a question on the integration of services; can you talk a little bit about the trends here? You’re integrating the drilling and the wireline and the seismic for your one earth model that I think you’ve talked about a lot in the past and now you add stimulation. Are these broadening the one earth model or are these more discrete combinations for certain projects? 
Andrew F. Gould: I think you have to take a very different view if you are talking about SIS and the Petrel seismic to simulation modeling capability because that model would accept data from anybody, not just Schlumberger.  In terms of bidding of exploration services, actually I think probably what we are seeing is that due to people shortages around the globe on certain exploration packages, people are asking us to manage and integrate our own services. But I would say that it’s a fairly small phenomenon at this point in time. 
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: So it’s -- right now, it’s a people leveraging phenomenon and it’s mostly exploration related as far as its pick-up? 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes. 
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: Okay, and on a competitive basis, are you -- how are you positioned here versus your peers in your ability? 
Andrew F. Gould: In as much as we’re the only company who has all those services in-house, that is to say particularly seismic, D&N, wireline, and well testing, obviously that gives you more leverage to be efficient in your integration than perhaps people who have to do it from different companies because that’s what traditionally the operators would have done. 
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: I have one other small one here left on my list -- a lot of talk in the report on artificial lift. How would you rate your share in artificial lift in the recent quarters? Do you think it’s picking up? Is it the same? 
Andrew F. Gould: Well, you know, Spears has us changing position between number one and number two in electrical submersible pumps and I actually don’t -- I honestly don’t know whether we are number one or number two in any particular quarter, because it changes constantly between us and our major competitor. So the answer is I don’t know, it changes all the time. 
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: All right. That’s all I have. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Thank you. Andrew, I was wanting to pursue a little further your comment that on the slower-than-forecast decline in Canadian gas production, which has puzzled me as well, I just wondered if you could explain what you think might be behind the slower decline in Canadian production, given the huge drop in drilling. 
Andrew F. Gould: Actually, I think and I absolutely can’t guarantee this, Robin, my feeling is that some of the delays in the heavy oil site B projects mean that less gas is being used in heavy oil production than people were anticipating. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Okay, so production then is sort of declining but the export availability is still the same or perhaps greater? 
Andrew F. Gould: It hasn’t been affected to the extent that people probably thought it would be. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: And then my follow-up is on the winter season in Canada, which -- when would you -- I guess that’s probably the most realistic timeframe in which we could see a change in the current depressed environment but when would you begin to see an indication of activity levels for the next winter drilling season there? 
Andrew F. Gould: Towards the end of the third quarter, I would say. They can turn it on and off very, very fast, as we’ve seen. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Right. Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: Thank you. A couple of questions, Andrew, first on IPM; is that all fixed -- maybe a couple of aspects of that. One, is that all fixed price business? Is there some -- would there be any risk of cost overruns as we’ve seen or do you think you guys have it right now in terms of pricing? And then, is there any performance aspect to the pricing, or how much of that 3.8 has performance aspects to it, where you get an increment if you produce, if you hit certain production benchmarks or beat benchmarks? 
Andrew F. Gould: The production content is low so this is mostly well construction. So a lot of is lump sum. Because of the current market conditions, a lot of our pricing and costs are indexed so we can pass through a lot of it. As in any very large drilling project, there is a risk but I think this has worked generally, we know pretty well, and that certainly as I’ve emphasized in the last couple of presentations I’ve made, the system within IPM now to evaluate projects and bid is probably an order of magnitude more sophisticated than it was when we had the accident in 2004, so I’m pretty confident that we’re okay. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: Okay, and is there still similar amounts behind the pipe or whatever -- 
Andrew F. Gould: They’re probably not totally similar but there are still large projects that are under-bid, yes, Kevin. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: That you’ll pick up and that will come in 2H? 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, I doubt we’ll have half-years like that every half-year, but you know, there’s still plenty of stuff. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: And then just one other; you’ve been talking about a shift ultimately to more exploration which obviously is very differentially positive for your company. Do you think you are beginning to actually see that, even with rig constraints out there? Or is that really going to still be really a this is just unusual what happened and -- 
Andrew F. Gould: No, we are seeing it but we’re not seeing it to nearly the extent that we probably will once the new builds start to hit, particularly the deep water new builds start to hit the market. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: And so if you -- I know you don’t want us to run ahead of ourselves with margins. You’ve done a good job of keeping us suppressed, or at least some of us suppressed, based on consensus but shouldn’t that tilt margins higher for your oilfield business away from North America, which has its own dynamic? 
Andrew F. Gould: Well to the extent that the expiration quotient in any one quarter is higher, then it has a very positive margin effect, which is what we’ve just seen in Asia in the last two quarters. It’s undoubtedly had an effect in places like the North Sea in the second quarter. But for it to be more general, Kevin, and to go much further than where it is, we need more rigs. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: But we know those are coming, and so -- 
Andrew F. Gould: Yes, but they are 2009 events, a lot of them. 
Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak: Okay. Thanks, that’s it for me. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from the line of William Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead. 
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew, you spent a lot of time talking about over-capacity in the pressure pumping market in North America. I’m curious if you are seeing any over-capacity surface in any of your other product lines and is it causing you any concern as we move to the back-half of ’07? 
Andrew F. Gould: No, we are not seeing -- apart from pressure pumping, we’re not seeing any over-capacity in the product lines that we participate in. 
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Okay, and Canada for the second quarter, did you see any pricing erosion outside of pressure pumping to speak of or strictly pricing-related in pressure pumping than volume declines? 
Andrew F. Gould: No, in Canada the market was so low there was pricing erosion pretty much across the board. 
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Across the board, okay. Thank you, Andrew. 
Operator: Thank you. We are showing a follow-up from the line of James Crandell with Lehman Brothers, and unfortunately, this is going to be our last question of the day. Please go ahead. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Andrew, I had two questions about the non-North American growth outlook in 2008 relative to 2007. Number one, what is your conviction that growth in Saudi and Russia will slow in 2008 versus 2007 and the way you see it now, given that there’s so many areas that seem to be increasing and given IPM and other things. What do you think that the odds are that there are enough offsets so that international growth overall in ’08 could continue at present levels? 
Andrew F. Gould: Firstly, I don’t have any concern about Russia, Jim. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: I thought you were concerned about the election and slowing going into the election. 
Andrew F. Gould: No, no, I think that there may be -- it may be quite uncertain through the end of the year but I don’t have any doubt that Russia will spend next year. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay. 
Andrew F. Gould: And on Saudi, yes, I think that absent new plans from the Saudis, that the rig count is going to plateau and therefore the growth is going to plateau. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay. How about overall? 
Andrew F. Gould: I think overall it’s very early to say but with the visibility we have today, I’ll not say we can match the growth rate of this year overseas but we certainly will still have significant growth. 
James Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to the management team if they do have any closing comments.
