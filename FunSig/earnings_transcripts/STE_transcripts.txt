===== 2025 Q4  (2025-05-15 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the STERIS plc Fourth Quarter 2025 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. And I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The Company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the Company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions is available in our release as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance from continuing operations. For the fourth quarter, total as reported revenue grew 4%, constant currency organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter, driven by volume as well as 210 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 170 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.3%. Positive price, favorable mix and productivity outpaced labor inflation. EBIT margin increased 110 basis points to 24.8% of revenue compared with last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.5%. The year-over-year increase was driven by unfavorable discrete item adjustments. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $270 million, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.74, a 40% increase over the prior year. We are pleased with our ability to grow earnings double digits all year with lower interest expense following the divestiture of the Dental segment. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 totaled $370 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $476 million. We continue to pay down debt during the quarter, ending with $2 billion in total debt. Gross debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 1.4x. Free cash flow for fiscal 2025 was a record $787 million, well above our full year guidance, driven by significant working capital improvements, in particular, inventory. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our fiscal 2025 performance and our outlook for fiscal 2026. Mike covered the quarter, so I will touch on our performance for the full year and our outlook for fiscal 2026. From a total company perspective, we ended the year with 6% revenue growth and 12% earnings growth. The diversified nature of our business allowed us to deliver results in line with our original outlook despite a few obstacles during the year. Looking at our segments, Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 6% for the year, led by strong recurring revenue streams. Our outperformance in consumables and services continues to be driven by procedure volumes in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains. Healthcare capital equipment revenue declined 5% for the year against our record year last year. Capital equipment orders grew over 12% for the full year as underlying demand remained strong. Margins improved nicely in Healthcare, hitting the 25% mark for the year, with volume, pricing and positive productivity offsetting labor inflation. Towards the end of the year, we also began to benefit from the restructuring cost savings, capturing approximately $5 million in savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Turning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 9% for the year with 7% growth in services. Med device customers remained stable, while bioprocessing was a bit lumpy during the year. Capital equipment shipments more than doubled compared to the prior year and exceeded our expectations. EBIT margins for AST were 44.8%, down slightly year-over-year as we continue to face energy and labor headwinds and had a negative mix shift from capital equipment shipments. Constant currency organic revenue increased 1% for Life Sciences for the full year, driven once again by strong growth in consumables and services, offset by a decline in capital equipment revenue. Margins increased to 42.3%, a 360 basis point improvement, benefiting from favorable mix, pricing and the divestiture of the CECS business. From an earnings perspective, we ended the year strong and exceeded our revised outlook with adjusted EPS of $9.22. The upside to our estimates was driven by lower corporate spending and improved profitability in both Healthcare and the Life Science segments. Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2026. As noted in the press release, we anticipate as reported revenue from continuing operations to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2026. We do not have any acquisition or divestiture impacts heading into the new fiscal year, and changes in foreign currency are expected to be neutral to STERIS. As a result, constant currency organic revenue growth is also expected to grow 6% to 7%. Included in this outlook is approximately 200 basis points of price. Each segment is expected to grow revenue in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal 2026. One minor note on AST revenue growth, our outlook reflects high single-digit growth in services revenue, which will be somewhat offset by a decline in capital equipment to get to the 6% to 7% growth total for the year. As you saw in the press release, we have estimated the impact for tariffs for fiscal 2026, which are reflected in our outlook. We manufacture a significant number of products in North America for use in the U.S., with about 85% of the products sold in the U.S. coming from North American manufacturing. This significantly reduces our tariff exposure compared to many others, but we are not immune to the impact of tariffs. Our fiscal 2026 outlook of $9.90 to $10.15 includes $30 million of tariff costs. The EPS range implies 7% to 10% growth in earnings, including tariffs, which is impressive performance. I want to take a moment to thank our supply chain and commercial teams for all their efforts on this front. The anticipated tariff impact is a net number. We do expect to leverage the strength of STERIS to mitigate some of our exposure. The $30 million estimate is based on global tariffs currently in effect, including the 10% global tariff and the recently announced 90-day trade deal with China. For your modeling purposes, at the high end of our earnings range, we would expect EBIT margins to increase approximately 20 basis points, reflecting our ability to offset tariffs. The effective tax rate is planned at approximately 23.5%. As we enter into the new fiscal year, we are well positioned to deliver both top and bottom line growth in 2026. That concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions so that we can begin the Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we'll get started.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Dave Turkaly from Citizens.
Dave Turkaly: Congrats on the quarter and the year. I guess, when we look at the segments, the biggest implied delta is then at LifeSci. And I was just curious to get some color on your comfort in that kind of bouncing back to that 6% to 7% range.
Dan Carestio: Yes. We did extremely well this year in our recurring revenues, especially our chemistries and consumables business and we would expect that to continue. Where we were down significantly was obviously capital equipment with a lot of uncertainty in pharma, the orders just dried up in the first half of the year. However, we saw a really strong rebound late in the year, and we are coming into fiscal 2026 with a pretty good backlog at a pretty good rate of orders. So we're confident that we'll be able to deliver the bulk of those in the fiscal 2026 and continue on with the growth that we've seen historically within our consumables business.
Dave Turkaly: Great. One quick follow-up. It seems like the tariff impact might be, I don't know, $0.24 or something like that on the EPS line, yet you're still getting into double-digit range at the high end. I guess if you could just talk about some of the puts and takes, maybe even on the interest expense. I know you delevered a bunch, but to get to that even despite the tariffs, just maybe some color there.
Mike Tokich: Yes, Dave, this is Mike. So as normal, there's quite a bit of headwinds or tailwinds or puts and takes. First and foremost, we are going to benefit from about $20 million of restructuring cost savings that will be in FY '26. So that's a good guide. In addition to that, we do not anticipate spending $20-plus million in ETO litigation. We anticipate spending about $5 million. So there's $15 million to the good also. But offsetting that is incentive comp getting back to 100% bonus. That is a negative $15 million. Obviously, the tariffs are another negative $15 million. And then if you look at our lower interest expense is really going to offset our higher tax rate. So that's just a reconciliation for FY '26 or the puts and takes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company.
Mike Matson: Yes. So just your cash flow guidance is a little bit down from '25. I know you called out the working capital improvement you saw in '25. I mean is that the main kind of differential between the two years?
Mike Tokich: The big thing, Mike, is we anticipate paying $40 million legal settlement for ETO, which is in FY '26. So that's going to negatively impact cash by $40 million. And of course, we are not anticipating to overachieve or reduce inventory as dramatically as we had in FY '25. But the big difference is the ETO legal fees, plus the impact of tariffs will negatively impact free cash flow also.
Mike Matson: Okay. Got it. And then just your leverage ratio is down quite a bit. So just maybe you can give us an update on M&A. I'd expected you'd probably be looking to do some more deals if you can find things, but...
Dan Carestio: Yes. I mean -- this is Dan. What I would say, Mike, is that we have the capacity both from a financial perspective and from an intellectual perspective at this point, having not done any meaningful M&A now for a few years. So if the right opportunity presents itself, we'll be involved.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Patrick Wood: Just two quick ones. It's probably too early to say, but how the conversations with the customer has been around potentially like onshoring back to the U.S.? I'm trying to think of -- I know some of the outsourced contract manufacturers have seen like a big pickup in people trying to pull production back. I'm just curious, is that something that you think is actually going to happen or is it more just a nice bullet point on a McKinsey slide.
Dan Carestio: It's probably the latter. But I do think there is some opportunities. I assume you're talking about med tech in particular, but I do think there are some opportunities. Many of those large companies have manufacturing for local regions. And to the extent that they may be manufacturing in Europe for the U.S. and they have U.S.-based manufacturing for similar products, you may see some shift of volumes going east or west depending on the benefit that they can do in terms of tariff and how easy it is to do it. Keep in mind, highly regulated industry, it's not easy to move production volumes if they don't have all the regulatory permits and things like that. So it takes time. But there'll be some fluidity to it, I'm sure.
Patrick Wood: That's awesome. And then just like quickly around the -- kind of that M&A angle again. What have you been hearing from some of the smaller players, niche out compliance costs, all those sorts of things? Is there a situation where -- I know EO capacity is tight, but is there a situation where they end up having to force sell themselves essentially to you guys or your peers? Like how do you think about industry consolidation on the back of the kind of one-off costs there?
Dan Carestio: I mean, in a general sense, I do think there'll be some industry consolidation, but we'd be in a much better position, greenfielding than we would be buying assets that are 30-plus years old.
Patrick Wood: I mean I'm 40, so I take offense of that.
Dan Carestio: Well, you've been compliant your whole life.
Patrick Wood: That's definitely not true.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mac Etoch from Stephens, Inc.
Mac Etoch: I'll add my congrats on the quarter and the year as well. Maybe just touching on the outlook for FY '26. As you commented on AST kind of coming in line with the 6% to 7% growth for the year, low single digits for capital equipment, high single digits for services. But can you flesh out what you're seeing within the respective customer bases there? I think there's a little bit of a delta between what maybe I and the Street were expecting versus your internal expectations. So if you could just provide us a little color there, that would be great.
Dan Carestio: Yes. I think what we're doing here is we've seen a lot of just movement month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter in terms of volume. It has started to sort of modulate down. But our view is let's take a little more conservative approach on how aggressively some of the bioprocessing is going to recover and also as customers reassess where they're manufacturing and if there is any movement going on and what implications that may have on total volume.
Mac Etoch: Got it. And then just in light of like the current macro and everything that's going on with general policy, is there -- how are conversations progressing with clients? Has there been any change in behaviors relating to Life Sciences or the AST segment?
Dan Carestio: Nothing that I would point to. There's a number of discussions, but I can't say there's anything concrete.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: Maybe two on Healthcare. The first one, the allusion to market share gains driving growth in the fiscal year and quarter. I know we've talked about this before, but is there any service or business line that really stands out to you there as to STERIS doing way better than market? If so, what is it? And what's going right?
Dan Carestio: Honestly, I would say it's just across the entire segment right now. Our teams are just doing a phenomenal job, in particular, in the North American markets that we're just -- we've just built out such a great portfolio and enterprise solution for large systems around sterile processing in particular and all the services that go along with that, that we continue to do really well.
Michael Polark: And for the fiscal year ahead, 6% to 7% growth for the Healthcare segment, would you call out any expected variances between how consumables, services and equipment should grow in '26?
Dan Carestio: No, we're not going to provide that level of granularity. I will hit back on the fact that we had a great order year for -- that bodes well in terms of backlog for capital going into next year. And -- so we're optimistic about that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler.
Jason Bednar: Nice finish to the year here. I wanted to see if we could spend just maybe a bit more time on tariffs, really topical for all companies here this quarter. Maybe break down, if you could, what the -- what that $30 million looks like across your network? I think -- I know you had $30 million in the press release. Mike, I think you made some comment at one point, I think, early on around $15 million, but just want to confirm it's $30 million net. And then if possible, break down, maybe again how much exposure you have here around like China-related tariffs and how much on the non-China side? It would just be helpful so we can update our own thinking as we see the next updates on the tariff front.
Dan Carestio: I mean -- this is Dan. I'll let Mike add to this. But at a high level, it's about half China and half sort of the 10% global tariff, and it's about $30 million.
Mike Tokich: No more to add on that.
Jason Bednar: All right. I like it. I think you said that $30 million, again, is a net number. Are you assuming any mitigation actions in that $30 million figure? Kind of what does that -- the pacing of that activity look like throughout fiscal '26? And then I'll just sneak in one extra here. It looks like share repo was a little lighter in the fourth quarter compared to the prior few quarters, but the stock has been hanging around a similar level now for some time, well off its size. Maybe just talk about the decision to pause some of that activity? And is there a signal we should draw from that pause?
Mike Tokich: Yes. I would say that, in general, we had bought about $200 million of shares during FY '25. We had bought those earlier in the year compared to the previous year. And I would say there's no signal that we're driving there. It is almost double what we typically bought just to offset dilution. And obviously, with our debt levels and debt ratios being where they are, we would definitely consider doing additional share buybacks beyond our offsetting -- just offsetting dilution in the future.
Jason Bednar: Sorry, on the mitigation activity on tariffs?
Mike Tokich: Yes. The $30 million is a net number, Jason. So it's significantly higher than that. Obviously, there's a lot to be done to mitigate. Timing is always the question. Obviously, our supply chain guys and girls are working very hard to offset as much as possible. But yes, it's a net number of $30 million, and we anticipate that, that will hit us about equally throughout the calendar year.
Dan Carestio: Yes. I would just add to that. With the 90-day pause or sort of redirect on the China tariffs, it gives us an opportunity to be much more strategic and thoughtful in terms of anything that we're changing as it relates to either vendors or manufacturing location or supply. So I would expect more weight on the back end.
Julie Winter: And also, I don't think we've said there's more weight on health care that primarily will be impacting the Healthcare segment with a little bit in Life Sciences.
Mike Tokich: And very, very little, if any, in AST.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc.
Brett Fishbin: Just wanted to ask another question on Healthcare capital equipment. It sounds like you're not trying to give specific guidance on growth, but maybe just talk a little bit more about the capital equipment backdrop. You're exiting the year with some growth in the backlog, but really just curious how like some of the recent macro developments have impacted like either ordering patterns or like hospitals' willingness to do implementations versus like any deferrals you may be seeing?
Dan Carestio: We've talked about this a lot in the past, and that is the capital equipment that we offer is really more of a utility than a luxury item. If you're going to see procedural growth and migration of procedures in different places, you can't accommodate that growth without having sterile processing capacity or surgical suites. So at times when it may impact replacement business, if those things can be deferred, it doesn't really impact the new equipment in terms of going into expansions. So we had a great order year last year, growing orders 12%. We've got our backlog into a very comfortable position. We haven't seen anything at this point that would indicate that, that's slowing for us and in fact, had really good volume in terms of orders going into Q1. So we're excited about the opportunity there.
Brett Fishbin: And then just as a follow-up, I'm going to switch gears a little bit to AST. I think it was a pretty good sequential progression in FY '25 from an AST growth standpoint. Just looking at FY '26, for services, it sounds like high single digits is kind of the starting point. I'm just curious if like demand were to be higher than expected, do you have enough capacity to theoretically return to double-digit growth in AST service? Or is capacity starting to become like a little bit of a limiting factor?
Dan Carestio: Sure. It's not a governor for us right now. We are well positioned to accommodate the industry's growth.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: Just one more also on AST. As you reflect on fiscal '25 in the services line, the December quarter was up 10%, March quarter up 6%. Dan, it sounds like bioprocess is a little lumpy. Is that the gyration or anything else to kind of spike out on the phasing of the last 12 months that makes more sense to you? My one other idea is any evidence that there was kind of front-loading of inventory building ahead of the Trump tariff era in the December quarter? Could that have been an influence in that period? Any other color would be great.
Dan Carestio: Sure. Yes. No, we did not see that in terms of anybody front-loading tariff, but I think you're giving the industry way too much credit to be able to see that coming. What I would say is we had a phenomenal December, an extraordinary December in terms of year-over-year comps. And then nobody showed up for the first seven days of January. So just the plant restarts from a customer perspective was very abnormally slow this year, one day shorter of February in terms of processing days, and then we had a wonderful second half of February and March in terms of growth. So -- but overall, those things impacted the quarter. I don't think it was anything more than that.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thank you, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. We look forward to catching up with many of you in the coming weeks.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2025 Q3  (2025-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the STERIS plc Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Winter. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO, and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for ten minutes. This webcast contains time-sensitive information and is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call without the express consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth, and free cash flow, will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our release as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. Once again, my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third-quarter performance from continuing operations. The third quarter, total revenue reported as reported grew 6% with constant currency organic revenue also growing 6% for the quarter, driven by volume as well as 240 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 90 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.6%. Positive price and productivity offset labor inflation. EBIT margin decreased 10 basis points to 23.3% of revenue compared with last year's third quarter. Litigation expense associated with our ethylene oxide trial, which began in December, as well as increased healthcare benefit costs from higher utilization by employees of our healthcare benefits program accounted for over $10 million of additional expense year over year in the third quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5%. The year-over-year increase is attributable to unfavorable discrete items. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $229 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.32, an 11% increase over last year. We are pleased with our ability to manage costs with the help of lower interest expense following the divestiture of the dental segment. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 totaled $299 million, and depreciation and amortization totaled $354 million. Capital expenditures were higher year over year mainly due to timing. We continue to pay down debt during the quarter, ending with $2.2 billion in total debt. Total debt to EBITDA at quarter-end was approximately 1.5 times gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was $588 million, well on track to achieve our full-year guidance of approximately $700 million. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third-quarter performance and our outlook for the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, we had another strong quarter. Looking at our segments, healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 7%, led once again by strong recurring revenue streams. Our outperformance in consumables and services continues to be driven by procedure volumes in the U.S., as well as price and market share gains. Healthcare capital equipment revenue declined 5% in the quarter due primarily to the timing of shipments. Orders grew over 10% in the third quarter, which is reflected in the $435 million healthcare backlog. While order growth remains robust, shipments were delayed by customer project delays. Margins improved nicely in healthcare with volume, pricing, and positive productivity offsetting labor inflation. Turning to AST, constant currency organic revenue grew 10% with 10% growth in services and a small decline in capital equipment shipments. Supporting growth in services, global med tech customers were stable, and we saw growth in bioprocessing demand above our expectations. EBIT margins for AST were flat year over year and increased nicely sequentially. While the additional volume was helpful, we continue to be impacted by higher labor and energy costs. Constant currency organic revenue declined 1% for the Life Sciences Group in the quarter, driven once again by strong growth in consumables and services, offset by a decline in capital equipment revenue. As expected, the divestiture of the CECS business on April 1st impacted our as-reported revenue. Margins increased to 42.6%, a 390 basis point improvement, benefiting from favorable mix pricing and the divestiture of CECS. Turning to our outlook for 2025, with three quarters under our belt, we are tightening our ranges for revenue and earnings. As mentioned in the press release, the biggest change since last quarter is the unfavorable impact of currency rate changes impacting both revenue and profit. In addition, we were shy of our revenue expectations in the third quarter for Healthcare Capital Equipment. As a result, our outlook for as-reported revenue from continuing operations is now approximately 6%. Constant currency organic revenue growth is also expected to be approximately 6%. Reflecting approximately $0.10 of impact from negative currency, adjusted earnings per diluted share are now expected to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.15. Our expectations for free cash flow are unchanged at about $700 million, with approximately $360 million in capital spending.
Dan Carestio: Before I conclude, I would like to comment on the first ethylene oxide case to be tried against Isometix, which ended in a mistrial last month. As you heard from Mike, we have incurred significant expenses defending Isometix. We believe that when the evidence of Isometix's safety practices and the scientific data related to ethylene oxide exposure is fairly presented at a trial, reasonable people will conclude that there is no connection between the unfortunate medical conditions of the claimants and Isometix operations. We believe the evidence presented during the four weeks of trial demonstrated that during the 44 months of Isometix ownership, its conduct complied with applicable law and was reasonable, transparent, and protective of our people, our neighbors, and the environment. After the court granted the plaintiff's request for mistrial, we learned that the majority of the remaining jurors supported a verdict in Isometix's favor at the time that deliberations were terminated. The court has scheduled this first case for retrial in May of this year, and we will continue to vigorously defend Isometix in these cases. We have continued to invest in these facilities. We have created processes and procedures that meet or exceed the applicable environmental and regulatory standards. That concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions so we can begin the Q&A?
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Chuck, can you please give the instructions?
Operator: Yes, ma'am. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. And if you would like to withdraw your question, you may press star then two. Our first question of today will come from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Jacob Johnson: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I'll start with the inevitable healthcare capital equipment question. Dan, you mentioned timing of orders in 3Q, and you talked about the updated guidance. You also talked about strong order growth. Do you think this is what you're seeing in Healthcare Capital Equipment is just related to timing of orders? Is it kind of specific to 3Q? Or are you seeing any hesitancy from customers?
Dan Carestio: No. The spending is still great because we're seeing the new orders come in. What we're seeing is just delays. The customers are just not ready from what they prescribed to us as the original date when they make the order. And then, you know, we're contacting customers a month or weeks in advance, and they're saying, guys, we're not gonna be ready. Take it at the end of the month. You know, I can't say definitively at this point that that's a trend because there's a couple of big orders that have moved the needle in the last quarter or two. But generally speaking, it's something that we're seeing that's occurring with our customers in terms of pushing out some of the timing of us shipping.
Jacob Johnson: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe on the good side of things, you mentioned bioprocessing outpacing expectations at AST. I think we've seen that in some of the bioprocessing reports this quarter. Just curious if you could unpack the trends you're seeing in that bioprocessing end market and what that could mean as we look out over for AST.
Dan Carestio: I think in a general statement, you know, last year, Q2, Q3 was kind of the trough that we saw in terms of demand through our facilities, which doesn't always necessarily correlate directly with the customers because it depends on where inventory is in the supply chain and how much inventory sits at the end customer, right, their customer. What you've seen as they've reported their earnings and the comments we've heard is that there seems to be some optimism and some positive trend of intake. Obviously, I'm optimistic just to think that we've sort of worked through the inventory challenges, and we've been consistent in our messaging saying this has been a relatively small but high-growth business for us for some time. We believe it was taking a reset, and I believe that we're through that reset period and hope to have more normalized growth going forward.
Jacob Johnson: I'll jump back in queue. Thanks for taking the questions.
Dan Carestio: Sure thing.
Operator: The next question will come from Brett Fishbin with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Brett Fishbin: Hey. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Just one on the guidance. I noticed in the press release that there was an indication that you're assuming no tariffs for the remainder of the fiscal year, which I think makes sense at this point based on what we know. Just thinking ahead to FY26, could you help frame how you're viewing the potential risk in the scenario that tariffs are, in fact, reintroduced in regions such as Canada and Mexico? Thank you.
Mike Tokich: Yes, Brett. Like others, we've done thorough analysis, looked at it many different ways, and the situation is so fluid at this point in time. We're not going to comment directionally as to what the impact could be. We're going to take more of a wait-and-see approach, but believe us, we are working hard behind the scenes to understand what the impact is and what our options are in order to help alleviate some of that impact.
Brett Fishbin: And if you remember, we do have a facility in Quebec, Canada, and one facility in Monterrey, Mexico. In total, they're about just under 10% of our cost of goods sold, just to give you some frame of reference.
Brett Fishbin: Alright. That's a helpful metric to keep in mind. Thank you. And then just a follow-up question on cost. I think you mentioned a step-up in legal expense as one of the drivers of the elevated or increased OPEX this quarter. So just wondering if you could touch on how we should be thinking about legal expense on a go-forward basis and maybe also just the decision or accounting reason to not adjust if they're abnormal types of expenses. Thank you.
Mike Tokich: Yeah. They are all recorded in our corporate expenses. They are not in the segment themselves. So this quarter, we incurred just under $6 million in year-over-year increase in expenses, and year-to-date, we are about just over $10 million. We anticipate probably another couple of million dollars, five-ish million, in the fourth quarter from an expense standpoint as a headwind that we've included in our forecast.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Polark: Good morning. Question on AST, seeing the services accelerate to 10%. Heard the bioprocess comments. Also heard MedTech customers stable. What does stable mean? Just, like, revenue flat. Can you give us an update on where you think inventory management headwinds are with that cohort?
Dan Carestio: This is Dan. Sorry. That was probably vague. Not flat, but back to what we would expect as more normalized growth ranges, the low single digits in terms of volume.
Michael Polark: So just on AST, kind of putting it all together, obviously, 10 plus is the target growth rate here. We're seeing it in the quarter. You know, when we saw the seven a few quarters ago, okay, maybe that was a sign of the turn. We kind of faded a little bit. Can you just comment on your level of confidence that, you know, this feels like a solid kind of step up, or is it still that, you know, working to better understand what situations really are, and we could have a chop around here on growth and AST for the next quarters still?
Dan Carestio: Yeah. I don't think it's that far out. I think what I would say is we're cautiously optimistic in the trend that we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And I would caution you that, you know, we have seen sort of a manufacturing pull effect from customers from time to time. So I'm not ready to declare victory and move on quite yet as it relates to one quarter of 10% growth, but we're enthusiastic to see the trend back in the direction where we'd like it to be.
Michael Polark: If I could ask one follow-up on Healthcare Capital. I heard the comments, timing of large shipment delay, timing of large projects. Get it. Is there any part of this that's, you know, STERIS is just kind of managing after, you know, a three-year period of ebbs and flows with the supply chain stuff, kind of managing the revenue level in that line down to a place where you can expect to grow it again in fiscal 26? Is there any element of that and update today?
Dan Carestio: I think it's too early to say. We're in our planning process now for next fiscal year, and I know we're off-cycle from a lot of companies. But we're just working hard to get through the fourth quarter, deliver for the customers, and we'll update you obviously at the next earnings call.
Michael Polark: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Jason Bednar: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. You know, maybe first one just to start, your margin performance was really strong in each of healthcare and life sciences. I think a record for healthcare, at least the highest we've seen in our model. So congrats on all of that. I did want to ask, can you talk about maybe the sustainability of these margins, especially in healthcare, as we think through some of the moving parts of possible mix shifts, restructuring, savings, different dynamics that could impact here over the next several quarters?
Mike Tokich: Yes. Jason, this is Mike. Yes. I mean, if you look at healthcare and life sciences both, they're both being impacted by favorable volume, mix, and price. And healthcare, actually, for the first time all year, we actually started seeing productivity improvements, which is great. We've been looking forward to seeing that. I would say for the rest of this year, we probably are on track. We're not going to comment as to FY26 at this point in time. We are definitely happy that we're seeing the leverage in healthcare. And don't forget, on that life sciences side, next year is going to be a lot harder because of that mix, favorable mix. Capital equipment should come back. It's down 30-some percent year over year. So we're definitely getting a big benefit out of the higher consumables and service mix. But all in all, we're very pleased with the margin improvement across the board for our segments.
Jason Bednar: Alright. Congrats, man. If I could shift over to the EO update. Probably limited in what all we can talk about here, but we have the retrial set for May, you say, Dan. Does the timing here of this trial, the retrial, affect other cases that were in line to be tried? I think there was another one that had been set for the spring. I just don't know if that ends up getting pushed out because of this retrial. Do they have to be, you know, tried in a certain order? And then, you know, secondarily, can you comment on whether any additional cases have been added for you beyond what was disclosed last quarter?
Dan Carestio: Yeah. Sure. So you have it exactly right. The judge elected, off a mistrial, to push out what was originally scheduled as the second case group to be pushed later into this summer sometime. I'm not sure of the exact tentative date, but, and pull the first case to the retrial, which is the May case. So, and no, we do not have any additional cases at this point.
Jason Bednar: Alright. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question will come from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Patrick Wood: Hey, guys. Thank you so much. And apologies for the crackly voice on my end. I guess, two from me. One would be, obviously, under a slightly different political environment, do you think there's any opportunity for the intensity of the legislative change around EO to loosen up a little bit or any change in how that might be? How do you feel about the new administration and how that might change EO's use?
Dan Carestio: Well, I mean, the rule's already out there, both in the ID and in the final rule. And, you know, we've been working hard to make sure that we can comply with that within the deadline, and I think we're incredibly well-positioned to do that. Clearly, there's a shakeup going on at the EPA, but it's unlikely they're going to retract a rule that's already in place at this point, in my view.
Patrick Wood: Yeah, I figured as much. And then the second one, a bit random on the endoscopy side of the business. Just curious where you're seeing, you know, both in the demand for your scopes on the volume side, but then also on the reprocessing side, how things are going there. Thanks.
Dan Carestio: Yeah. In a general sense, I mean, we've continued to do really well, especially on the reprocessing side. We've placed a lot of capital, and we have a lot of chemistry flow into that capital. That's sort of the pull-through that we've got over the last, I don't know, good year now of high capital shipments relative to Medivators products, the AERs. In terms of the endoscopy products, we're doing fine. We could be doing better, frankly. I think we're growing about at market in that space.
Patrick Wood: If one final one then. If you had to guess how much of your, like, say, consumables business was accounted for on the reprocessing side of endoscopy just as a proportion. Do you have a rough idea of where that sits?
Mike Tokich: Well, I don't know, Patrick. Yeah. No. The only data point we give is that endoscopy in total is about a billion-dollar business for STERIS. That's including our capital, though. It includes everything.
Patrick Wood: Totally. Totally got it. Awesome. Thank you so much.
Operator: Again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one. Our next question will come from Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to ask one, you know, in terms of your conversations with your customers and, you know, both the hospitals and the life science area. You know, are you hearing any concerns about potential policy changes with the new administration, or is it more of a hold until they kind of wait and see what happens with potential changes there?
Dan Carestio: Yeah. No. We haven't seen it. In fact, we had a really good orders quarter both in healthcare and in life science capital. After an abysmal year in terms of orders in life sciences, we, you know, are cautiously optimistic that pharma is doing what they typically do in their normal cyclical buying patterns and getting back towards investment. You know, in terms of our large healthcare system customers, we haven't seen any change in their direction. I know there's a lot of uncertainty about how they're gonna get paid and, you know, all those different things from a patient and from a government perspective, but we haven't seen it impact us at all at this point. You gotta keep in mind, we talk about this frequently. Our product, the majority of our products, especially the equipment side, is really a utility. And it's really procedure-driven. It's not a reimbursed product, you know, from a government perspective.
Mike Tokich: And, Mike, just to give you a few numbers around that, in fact, we are up about 14% for the growth in healthcare year over year, which is very strong for us. And you look at our backlog, right, our backlog is roughly almost $80-$85 million higher than what we anticipated in that $350 million range. So there's no concern there from our part on the orders structure from the healthcare customers.
Mike Matson: Okay. Got it. And then just wanted to get an update on inventory surgery centers. I think you've talked about that being sort of a growth driver in the past. Is that still the case? And do you have any, you know, products or anything you've launched to kind of target that call point?
Dan Carestio: Yeah. No. We still see it that way. There's clearly migration going on, you know, at a large acute care into, you know, satellite, you know, smaller facilities. And that's a trend that's been going on for quite some time. We do have a portfolio that is specifically geared for that on the equipment side, both in our surgical products as well as our SPD, sterile processing equipment. And we do have a dedicated channel in that space as well. So we're putting resources and people and R&D investment into it, and I'm confident that we're gonna be well-positioned in that space.
Mike Matson: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Polark: Appreciate it. Two more if I may. On healthcare services, I have a sense of how you're gonna answer this, but can you just unpack? I mean, the growth drivers there, really good performance, teens. Again, I believe it's all organic, has been so for a while. Is this sustainable? What's a good base case here on growth profile as we roll into next year?
Dan Carestio: It's complicated, is what I would say. But in a good way, I think, you know, look, a lot of that is a significant portion of our services businesses aren't traditional equipment services. Right? And we've placed a lot of equipment over the last couple of years. And as the equipment comes off warranty, we have a very high contract rate in terms of making sure that we get those folks onto our contracts. And where they don't get on our contracts, we have a great partnership program with the biomeds and the healthcare facilities to ensure that they're buying our parts and using us for consultation on service repair. You know, in terms of our general repair business for scopes and things like that, you know, that's been a really strong piece of business for us. You know, maybe it even gets stronger if people delay capital purchases on scopes and need more repair. Not sure, hard to say. But generally speaking, we don't see those trends reverting. The only thing I would say is that as inflation continues to come down, our ability to get the level of price to cover our cost that we've seen over the last year and a half or so in the services business will probably come down a bit as well.
Michael Polark: Helpful. Life sciences, maybe tying in the bioprocess take from AST. I know they're typically different kinds of customer cohorts, but how do you assess the prospects for life sciences to return to organic growth over the next year or so? What are you seeing from those customers?
Dan Carestio: Well, what I would say is life sciences as a whole this year, it's not that impressive, but it's because of the capital slowdown that we've seen there. The engine of that business is really our consumables business, and we're seeing significant growth in that space. And actually, a few quarters ahead of what we've seen in the bioprocessing customers of AST, where there's a lot more destocking going on. So we're optimistic about the growth trends that we're seeing there and our position in the aseptic manufacturing environment of pharma.
Michael Polark: Thanks for taking the call.
Dan Carestio: Yep. Sure thing.
Operator: The next question will come from Dave Turkaly with Citizens. Please go ahead.
Dave Turkaly: Hey. Good morning, Simon. Jumping around a little. I know you want to give guidance, so this may not fly, but I'll give it a shot. So, Mike, you mentioned, you know, 14% order growth. You mentioned the backlog. You know, the level. And just looking at the trends and obviously realizing that healthcare has gotten a lot bigger, but in the overall business, it seems like there's a shift kind of towards that, you know, even towards the mid to higher single digit. I'm just thinking out loud here that that seems like something we've seen for a while now, and maybe that's a new normal. I don't know if you have any comment on that.
Mike Tokich: No. We're very happy, Dave, where we are, and we have been with healthcare. Obviously, it's a nice try on trying to get us to talk about 26, but we will wait to talk about 26 until May. But again, we're very pleased where we're at. The only thing we're a little displeased with is just the timing of the shipments. Right? Because we're taking the orders. It's taking us a little bit longer, as Dan talked about, to get those orders out the door. But at the end of the day, as long as it is in backlog, our cancellation rate is nil and has been nil. So we are confident that those orders get out, and we'll talk more about the timing of when those shipments happen next quarter.
Dave Turkaly: Great. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Julie Winter for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us. We will be on the road a bit in both virtual and in-person conferences over the next few months, and look forward to catching up with everyone.

===== 2025 Q2  (2024-11-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everybody, and welcome to the STERIS plc Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our release as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance from continuing operations. As you saw in the press release, we have continued the momentum from the start of the fiscal year. Total as-reported revenue grew 7% in the second quarter. Constant currency organic revenue also grew 7% in the quarter, driven by volume as well as 240 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 50 basis points compared with the prior year to 43.7%. Positive price and favorable material costs were offset by labor inflation and productivity. Reflecting the decline in gross margin, EBIT margin decreased 30 basis points to 22.2% of revenue compared with last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.7%. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $212.2 million. And adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.14, a 15% increase over last year. Capital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2025 totaled $210 million, and depreciation and amortization totaled $228 million. Capital expenditures were higher year-over-year, mainly due to timing. We continued to pay down debt during the quarter, ending with $2.2 billion in total debt. Total debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 1.5x gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2025 was $344.5 million, right at the halfway mark of our full year guidance of approximately $700 million. With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, we had another strong quarter. Looking at our segments. Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 7% in the quarter, led once again by strong recurring revenue streams. Our outperformance in consumables and services continues to be driven by procedure volumes in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains. Healthcare capital equipment revenue declined 2% in the quarter due to the timing of shipments. Orders grew over 30% in the second quarter, which reflected in the $405 million healthcare backlog. We now anticipate that the healthcare capital equipment revenue will be flat to slightly down for fiscal 2025, mainly due to the timing of shipments during the fiscal year in the difficult fourth quarter comparisons. We remain confident in our expectations of a strong year for our Healthcare segment and expect that the recurring revenue outperformance will more than make up for the lower capital equipment revenue. Margins have held up nicely in health care with pricing, positive productivity and lower material costs offsetting labor inflation. Turning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 9%, with 6% growth in services and a significant quarter in the capital shipments. Supporting growth in services, global medtech customers were stable, and we saw the first signs of increased bioprocessing demand. We continue to anticipate bioprocessing revenue in the second half of our fiscal year will grow. EBIT margins in AST were impacted by labor and energy costs, which continued to increase for the segment. In addition, we recorded a long-standing loss on a capital equipment order in our med-x business unit. We would expect margins will improve from these levels in the second half of the year. Constant currency organic revenue growth for Life Sciences was 3% in the quarter, driven once again by strong growth in consumables. As expected, the divestiture of the CECS business on April 1 impacted our as-reported revenue. Margins benefited from favorable mix, pricing and the divestiture. Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2025. For the full year, we are reiterating our outlook from continuing operations, including 6% to 7% constant currency organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $9.05 to $9.25. Our expectations for free cash flow are also unchanged at about $700 million, with about approximately $360 million in capital spending. For your modeling, we do have a few moving pieces we wanted to highlight. From a segment perspective, Life Science revenue is now anticipated to be about flat for the year with declines in capital equipment, somewhat mitigated by the strength in consumables. Healthcare is now anticipated to grow mid- to high single digits with continued strength in recurring revenues. The outlook for AST continues to be high single-digit revenue growth for the year, but we no longer expect to exit the year at double-digit revenue growth. All in, we expect constant currency organic revenue growth to be 6% to 7% for the full fiscal year. From a profit perspective, we now anticipate margins to be about flat for the year. All in, we are pleased with the first half of the fiscal year. The diversified nature of our segments continues to be a benefit to our total performance. That concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions so we can begin the Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan for your comments. Eric, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we can get started.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens.
Jacob Johnson: Maybe a couple on AST. First, just on the loss on the large equipment sale, can you frame up the magnitude of that loss, just how much of a headwind that was to margins in the segment given they were down sequentially? And then I'm curious, I think that was still included in your adjusted EPS. Was this something that was contemplated in the guidance for the year? Or is this something kind of a bad -- proverbial bad guy that you're overcoming?
Mike Tokich: Jacob, the impact to margins was about 200 basis points on that loss itself. And -- I mean, we had contemplated a loss, but not as large of a loss. So we were a little bit surprised by the amount. But it is a onetime event that will not recur. And it goes back to the original acquisition of Med-X back in, I think, 2020, we had taken quite a while to fulfill that order, and we had no ability to adjust the costing on that project.
Jacob Johnson: Got it. And then Dan, I heard you mention no longer exiting the year at double digits for AST, but then it seems like maybe some positive bioprocessing commentary there. You just talked about any kind of incremental headwinds you've seen in AST that could be offsetting bioprocessing or maybe by bioprocessing is not coming back as quickly as as you thought...
Dan Carestio: We’re actually very optimistic on bioprocessing being accretive to our growth, especially in the second half of the year. And I think at this point, we’re halfway through the year. And although the growth has been nice, it’s not maybe where I had hoped it would be from a medtech perspective at this point. And although we see it continuing to improve based on run rate, I don’t believe we’re going to exit at a double-digit multiple at this point. I think we’re going to get there eventually. I’d hoped it would be by fourth quarter. And what we’re seeing now is it’s probably a little later than that.
Operator: Our next question will be from Brett Fishbin with KeyBanc.
Brett Fishbin: Just one on the healthcare capital equipment updates. So I appreciate the update moving from low single-digit growth expectation to flat to slightly down. I was really just hoping if you could parse that out a little bit, maybe between progress year-to-date versus where you thought you'd be coming into the quarter? And then maybe a little bit around the backlog moving pieces and why that stepped up this quarter?
Dan Carestio: Yes. I mean a little bit detailed. I mean on the quarter specifically, it wasn't the best quarter for shipments. We ran into some weather-related delays and things like that with the hurricanes at the end of the quarter that did impact some shipments, especially in the Southeast. Our backlog remains incredibly strong, and we keep stacking up really strong order months on top of each other, especially in the healthcare organization. The reality is that with 6 months remaining to book and ship, we're talking about margins of 1% or 2% in one direction or the other. I wouldn't spend too much time on this in terms of -- and more importantly, we're more than offsetting it with the higher profit mix of consumables and services that's coming through.
Brett Fishbin: All right. Cool. And then just as my follow-up on the operating margin expectation. Is the change in language really just tied to the pace of call it, sequential improvement at AST and the favorable revenue mix? Or is there anything else that changed from the prior quarter? And then maybe just a follow-up to that, how do we get confident or investors get confident in your ability to return to a level of operating margin expansion for next year?
Mike Tokich: Yes. Brett, the impact is definitely related to AST. Obviously, with AST not performing at our expectations and exiting at double digits, we are not going to be able to drive that EBIT margin improvement. Other than that, I would say there's nothing else that we would point to that would stop us from obtaining our long-term goal of continuing to expand the EBIT margin on an annual basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Patrick Wood: I've just got two, please. I guess on the first one, I know it's quick. But have you heard from any of your customers around supply chain changes, tariffs coming in? Do you have any expectations for how that might move things around and if there could be an effect positive or negative for you guys?
Dan Carestio: No, we haven't really, Patrick, and thanks for the question. But what we have seen over the last few years as it relates to the AST business, there's a lot of reshoring and front-shoring, I would say. We've seen we've seen enormous growth in our Asia Pacific region, particularly in Malaysia, where we've got a number of new builds that have come online over the last couple of years with a lot of business that has as located there as it's more of a front-shoring operation in anticipation of some challenges that might or may not occur as it relates to China.
Patrick Wood: That's really helpful. And then I guess the only other one was there's not a lot of public data on it, but the yield litigation side of things. Do we have any update on that on upcoming news flow? Or anything you can help give us a sort of sense for how that's playing out in the -- over the next few months?
Dan Carestio: Yes. What I would say is we do have litigation related to the Waqigail-Illinois facility that we owned for a little over 3 years from 2005 to 2008 under the Isomedix name. And we have provided some significant disclosures in the Q. And I would point to those, and I think it's best that we continue on our path of not discussing ongoing litigation until there is something more definitive to discuss, but I'll refer you to the that you look there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: I want to ask on health care consumables and services. There's obviously a lot of stuff, a lot of products services in those two lines. And you mentioned share gains as a driver of the differentiated growth. Can you unpack that for us? What's going especially well? Can you -- is it in the processing department? Is it OR consumables? Is it repair stuff? Is it all of it? Where are you seeing differentiation in share?
Dan Carestio: Yes. It's all of that, to be honest with you. We've shipped an awful lot of capital equipment over the last 18 months or so. And we've really positioned ourselves nicely as it relates to some of the large IDM GPO contracts on the consumable parts, especially in sterile processing. And I think it's just that and the fact that procedure volumes are particularly strong in the U.S. that's driving consumption of our consumables business as well as our services business, which is just having a gangbuster year as well.
Michael Polark: Can I ask you a follow-up on the balance sheet. It's obviously under-levered, let's say, versus your history. So can you comment on the M&A pipeline? How does it look? Seller expectations? And if the M&A kind of opportunity set is not overly compelling at the moment, is there a chance this becomes more assertive with share repurchase?
Dan Carestio: We cannot comment on the M&A pipeline. I mean if we have news and when it's appropriate, we'll discuss that. Clearly, we're in a position where we have plenty financial powder, if you will, to move on something, and we definitely have the internal capacity from a management and integration capability. But the timing of our abilities and opportunities don't always sync up. So we'll see how that plays out.
Mike Tokich: But I would also add that deal standpoint, it is robust, but at the same point in time, most of the – what we’re looking at is smaller tuck-in acquisitions, which is what we historically have done. And we did buy $100 million of shares back in the first half of the fiscal year, which is reflected in the balance sheet and the debt right now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.
Mike Matson: So I heard the commentary around labor and energy costs continuing to pressure your margins to some degree. Just given kind of the general cooling and inflation we've seen, is this just sort of lagging kind of some of the other, I guess, costs? Or is there something else going on here that's causing those to be higher?
Mike Tokich: I would say, Mike, the labor, obviously, is the lagging piece, and we should anniversary that sometime during the fiscal year. Unfortunately, the energy costs are really something that are out of our control. And I think there is also a bit of a timing issue, too, because as we incur those energy costs, we cannot pass those on immediately. So there is definitely a little bit of a lag there, too.
Mike Matson: Yes. Okay. And then bioprocessing, I just was wondering if you can give us a sense of how much of AST that is? I think the last time I looked or the last time I heard you guys say something that was so about 2% of your total revenue. Is that accurate or...
Dan Carestio: It’s based on the reduction that we saw over the last 1.5 years to sort of the new set point, it’s less than that. I mean it’s in the 6% to 8% of the AST revenue ballpark or something like that, and projected to grow nicely off of that new level.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: I want to ask on AST, medtech customer trends. Dan, I think you mentioned not quite where you thought it could or should be. Do you think this is just the inventory management stuff? Or is there something else going on that you've picked up?
Dan Carestio: I think it's two things. I do definitely think it's inventory management. Just like STERIS has done a nice job of bringing down our inventory this year, I think a lot of our medtech customers are taking the same opportunity. And then sometimes what I've seen is the classic effect. We saw pretty strong growth in AST for end of Q4, early Q1, and then we saw a slowdown where they had maybe overproduced a bit and are keeping tight controls on inventory. Overall, what I would say is procedure rates is what drives that business. And right now, the procedure rates versus the AST growth are not matched up. And I think that as those converge, we'll see better growth out of AST. I mean all that 6% is not that disappointing. I mean let's not be overcritical here. It's just we hold that business to a very high standard.
Michael Polark: Understood. Since I'm here, I'll ask one more. On Life Sciences, the margin has been perking up you commented on it. Is it simply lower equipment as a portion of that segment, so it's a mix thing? Or are you taking other kind of self-help actions to defend profit?
Dan Carestio: It’s all mix. That consumable business is growing incredibly nicely and that is the higher-margin business there. And that is more than offsetting the decline in capital and from a profit perspective, but from a percentage perspective is driving it up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler.
Jason Bednar: Apologies upfront here from I think it was already covered just juggling on a few calls here this morning. I want to start on EO. And again, apologies if you can't answer these, but I'll try anyways. Can you specify whether -- what you've disclosed in the 10-Q this morning, whether you're a codefendent or sole defendant, in those cases where you are defending against? Why not settle these cases out of court? Just maybe looking for, not necessarily your entire legal strategy, but there is risk in going to trial, of course. And then can you help us with what kind of insurance you might have against the situation?
Dan Carestio: Yes. Other than M&A strategy, the other thing we absolutely don't talk about is legal strategy. So I will refer you to the comments that are in the queue, and to say that we'll stay on our comments around ongoing litigation at this time.
Jason Bednar: Okay. I mean I guess, Dan, the insurance pieces and part of legal strategy and the defendant versus versus sole is more factual. I mean any comment on either of those?
Dan Carestio: I have no comment, no.
Jason Bednar: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. In AST, the outlook sounds like maybe a hair lower today. Is that exclusively bioprocessing related? Are there any adjustments that you're seeing or moderation, I should probably better say on pricing in that category?
Dan Carestio: No. It's just -- honestly, it's just the volumes that we've seen year-to-date and the trend. If we were up 1.5 points higher year-to-date, we'd be telling you no change in the AST outlook for the whole end of the year. But based on run rate, we've adjusted that to take a much more conservative approach.
Jason Bednar: Okay. And does that influence at all the -- I guess, your confidence in seeing improved margins within that segment, adjusting, of course, for the equipment last year, that was kind of a idiosyncratic drag. But looking forward, does the delayed timing on getting back to double-digit growth in AST affect how you think about incremental margins in that segment? .
Dan Carestio: No, adjusting out the onetime loss on the capital for Mevex, we would expect margins to be strong in the second half of the year, in AST in particular.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson as a follow-up, Needham & Company.
Mike Matson: Just one quick one here. So with the margins now expect -- our margin at could be flat, you're still reiterating the EPS guidance. So I mean, is it just still kind of fall within that range, maybe at the lower end or something? Or is there something else going on in the P&L to offset that?
Mike Tokich: Yes, Mike, it does fall within the range, but we are seeing an impact or a favorable impact on interest expense. We now expect interest for the full year to be about $90 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens.
Jacob Johnson: Everybody else do a follow-up. So I figure I join them. Just -- on the Life Sciences business, the strong consumable demand, can you flesh out kind of what you're seeing in that business? What's driving that demand? And just curious, I think there's a lot of debate around kind of what's going on with pharma demand, maybe at a higher level, kind of what are you seeing from those customers right now?
Dan Carestio: Yes. I would say, keep in mind, we’ve got somewhat easy comps last year. There was a lot of destocking going on in our consumables business, in particular, in the barrier products space as well as the chemistry space. And – so against those relatively easy comps, we’ve seen very strong recovery from our core customers that are back in full production.
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us today, and we’ll be at a few conferences here this fall and look forward to just catching up with many of you then.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you, everybody, for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-08-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the STERIS First Quarter of 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Also please be aware that today's call is being recorded. I would like to now turn the call over to Julie Winter of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our press release, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. Our discussions today will be focused on results from continuing operations. As you saw in the press release, we started the year strong with total revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth of 6% driven by volume, as well as 270 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points compared with the prior year to 45.1%. Positive price and favorable material costs were somewhat offset by inflation. EBIT margin decreased 20 basis points to 22.3% of revenue compared with the first quarter last year. Increased compensation and higher insurance costs are impacting EBIT margins. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3%, lower than the prior year due to favorable discrete item adjustments. Net income in the quarter was $201.7 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $2.03, a 10% increase over last year. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 totaled $108 million, and depreciation and amortization totaled $112.7 million. Capital expenditures were higher year-over-year, mainly due to timing. With the closing of the dental divestiture on May 31st, we were able to pay down debt, reducing total debt to $2.3 billion. Total debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 1.6 times gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $195.7 million. Free cash flow was impacted by the timing of capital spending. Last week, we announced our 19th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our quarterly dividend increased $0.05 per share from $0.52 to $0.57. With that, I will turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Carestio: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, we had a strong start to our new fiscal year. Looking at our segments, Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter. Our outperformance in consumables and services continues to be driven by procedure volumes in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains. It is our expectation that recurring revenue will continue to grow above procedure volumes and relatively independent of our capital equipment shipments. Over half of our consumables and service revenue is not related to our capital equipment. As anticipated, our Healthcare capital equipment revenue declined in the quarter against challenging comparisons. However, we still anticipate low single-digit revenue growth for Healthcare capital equipment for the full fiscal year. We remain confident in our expectations of a strong year for our Healthcare segment. Turning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 8%, the best performance we have seen in over a year. Supporting that growth, Europe MedTech grew nicely in the quarter and bioprocessing was about flat year-over-year globally. We are pleased to see these two factors playing out as planned and continue to anticipate a return to growth in bioprocessing revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. Constant currency organic revenue growth for Life Sciences was 4% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in consumables. As expected, the divestiture of the CECS business on April 1st impacted our as-reported revenues. For the full year, we are reiterating our outlook, including 6% to 7% constant currency organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $9.05 to $9.25. Our expectations for free cash flow also unchanged at about $700 million with approximately $360 million in capital spending. All-in, we are pleased with the start of the fiscal year. Trends continue to head in a positive direction for all of our segments and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance. That concludes the prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions so that we can begin the Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Joe, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we can get started.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question of today will come from Brett Fishbin with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Brett Fishbin: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just wanted to start off on Healthcare capital equipment. I'll repeat my question a little bit since it sounds like you already kept kind of the directional low single-digit guidance for the year. I'm just curious how the first quarter compared versus maybe your internal expectations? And then what drives the step-up in trends through the year?
Dan Carestio: Yes, I would say that it was right in line with our expectations. There's always orders that ship, slip one way or another in terms of our general outlook for the year remains unchanged and typically with last year being the exception, Q1 is our slowest quarter in capital shipments. It’s a New Year in terms of sales and sales commissioning and it generally is our lowest quarter. But tough comps to last year as we were still pushing through an enormous backlog as a result of some supply chain and manufacturing challenges that we were having in the comps.
Brett Fishbin: And then just on the rest of the Healthcare segment, it was really nice to see some of the double-digit growth trends continue in services and consumables more than offset at least for our model, the miss and capital equipment. I mean, you mentioned market share gains, healthy market activity. Is there anything else that you would call out just driving the continued trend that we've seen in either of those segments?
Dan Carestio: We reiterate the fact that most of those products and services that are consumables are reoccurring in nature of procedural driven. And as we've seen the continued rise in sustained growth of procedures, in particular, in the North American market. We've been lifted in that area by market in general. But as you're well aware, we've punched above our weight for the last couple of years in capital sales. So having those new placements out there, having that access from a sales perspective has helped fuel our ability to take a little share as part of our total enterprise solution selling process, where we're really working with the large IDNs and large healthcare systems to take the full value of STERIS.
Brett Fishbin: All right. Got it. And last question for me. Just touching on operating margin, I know 1Q is sometimes a little bit seasonally lower, but just given that it was down 20 bps year-over-year. I'm curious if you could give a little bit more color that you touched on a couple of the high-level drivers there. And then if you still expect to demonstrate a level of year-over-year operating margin expansion for the full year FY 2025? Thank you very much.
Mike Tokich: Yes, certainly, Brett. Yes. As I spoke with my comments, we definitely did have some increased compensation year-over-year in Q1, which negatively impacted our margins. And we did have significantly higher insurance costs in the quarter. Everybody looks at EBIT margin. I mean if you look at EBIT dollars, EBIT dollars were up $20 million. So obviously, we're not getting the leverage that we anticipate, but it's Q1. We still anticipate that we will drive positive EBIT margin leverage for the full year as we talked about last quarter.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson: Yes. Just following up on the commentary there around inflation. So it sounds like the -- while the material side, materials components has kind of improved, the labor side is still seeing some pressure. Is that right? And do you expect that to get better this year? I mean we've seen the unemployment rates starting to pick up? Or is it still really kind of battle out there to hire and routine employees?
Dan Carestio: Yes. I would say this. I mean, the thing with the compensation and labor is it tends to go in place months before you feel the effect of it. It's because it sort of rolls in aggregate. I don't believe it's going to continue to go up in any meaningful way. And clearly, our ability to staff and turnover has come down quite a bit. So it feels like it's very much in control. It's just -- it's catching up with the labor rates that have been put in place over the last six, nine months, 12 months as they roll into this new fiscal year.
Q – Mike Matson: Yes. Okay. Got it. And then just in the -- I wanted to get an update on the Life Sciences business as a medical device analyst that I think I don't know as much about or follow us closely. It looks like it's been a little slower. Just wondering kind of what the outlook is there and what you're seeing in the market.
Dan Carestio: Yes. We've definitely seen some slowdown in demand for capital problems, and that's a result of some of the decreased funding and some of the cutbacks that we've seen in general pharma and bio pharma over the last six, nine months and there is some natural cyclicality to those purchases. However, having said that, we're showing strong growth in our services businesses and have been more importantly, in our consumables business, which drives a disproportionate amount of the income through the Life Science segment. So we feel confident in our ability to continue to deliver on those aspects.
Q – Mike Matson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Q – Michael Polark: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I hate to harp on this, but the Healthcare capital equipment guidance of low single-digit revenue growth this year, I still struggle to get there given where 1Q landed and what we see out of the backlog. I suspect, over the last 90 days or so, you've heard this feedback. And I'm interested in your feedback, to the feedback. Like what are we all missing in our models, why and you could call me a bad analyst and bad model or that is fair. But like I just -- I struggle to get there. So is it that you expect bookings to be a lot higher, the rest of this year versus what we've been seeing in dollar terms? Any more color there, I'd appreciate it.
Dan Carestio: Mike, I don't think you're a bad a bad analyst or model or by any means. The problem is the model got broken over the last 18 months in terms of how it normally has operated historically. And we ended up having a lot of backlog and a lot of large project orders. What we have now, now that manufacturing and supply chain is back in control back to normal lead time levels is the ability to sell a lot more on the turn business, which is something we weren't really able to do over the last 18, 24 months where we were much more challenged. So we're confident in our ability, even with a lower backlog to be able to turn product and get it installed in our customers by the end of fiscal year.
Q – Michael Polark: Appreciate that. A follow-up on AST. Obviously, you see kind of a continuation of the higher growth rate here. I heard positive comments out of Europe. As you look forward to the rest of this fiscal year, are capacity expansions, and you've obviously been investing a lot of growth dollars here to expand your fleet and network. Are capacity expansions expected to be differentiated growth contributor here to AST over the next year or so? Or would you say that bid as normal relative to the last few years?
Dan Carestio: I would say it's normal. It's a long-term play, and it's -- you can't really look at the expansions as same-store versus new store because most of our expansions are on existing sites of adding just existing or adding new capacity to existing sites. So we see it a continuation to facilitate the growth that we've had historically.
Q – Michael Polark: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Mac [ph] on for Jacob. Just following up on the Life Sciences side of the business, [indiscernible] there. I think this is important tied to injectable drug demand, and we are seeing a number of capacity additions in this end market. In the near-term, I know, there are some headwinds that you called out around capital spending, but are you seeing any issues in the injectable market at this point?
Dan Carestio: We are. It's definitely a bit of a tailwind that's offsetting some of the headwinds in the space, I guess, is what we'd say. And fortunate thing about the injectables, that's obviously in our sweet spot of aseptic manufacturing and definitely feeds well into our chemistries and critical environments products as well as barrier product solutions. So it's -- and it's from fortunately, some of the majors as it relates to major manufacturing customers of which we do business with many of them.
Unidentified Analyst: And then you'd previously announced some supply chain initiatives. I think you're working on moving to some larger suppliers. How is that going? And do you expect any margin impact and looking forward?
Dan Carestio: Yes, but it's a long-term play. It's going to take time to -- to ring that out and vet those suppliers and get everything in place. Yes, the long-term play is to over time and also getting better scale and value out of our manufacturing operations. But really, the most important thing is the surety of supply. If there's one thing we learned year and a half, two years ago was making sure that we were with the right suppliers.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Appreciate the color.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Jason Bednar: Hey, good morning, everyone. Apologies upfront here. I'm going to come back to this Healthcare equipment topic. I know you don't provide exact numbers on orders, but I think all of us back into your order book based on the revenue and the backlog figures that you do provide. So I guess I'm wondering if we can go one step further beyond the Healthcare equipment revenue guidance of low single digits. Can you remind us or help us with what your assumptions might be for order growth this year? And are you anticipating Healthcare backlog to move higher or lower from where we are at the end of the first quarter?
Mike Tokich: Yeah, I would say that in our assumptions, the order growth would be mid-single digits, and we would have backlog somewhere in that $350 million range, but it could be lower than that easily. That is just a target that we have. But the big thing that we really need to do, as Dan spoke earlier about, is really have the opportunity to get and tackle the turn business that we did not have the ability to do that with our lead times coming down significantly, that's really the driver. And that's something that you guys really can't see what we're doing and how we're doing it. And as Dan said, the model has been broken. And obviously, we're doing everything we possibly can to get back to more sustainable model that we were used to and when capital equipment wasn't such a large conversation in the past, right?
Jason Bednar: Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And then just maybe a couple of follow-up modeling questions for you. And sorry, if I missed it, just the -- I think you said, there were some discrete items in that interest other line. That was just a notable delta versus our model. Just were these factored into the original guide and any other detail you can provide there? And then the 21% tax rate in the period, is that the right level we should be thinking about on a go-forward basis? Or were there one-timers that that pushed rate lower than you expected in the first quarter?
Mike Tokich: Yeah. On the tax rate, there were some favorable discrete item adjustments that were one-timers that definitely pushed the rate lower. I think our full year guidance still calls for 23% year rate. I would stick with that at this point in time. And we did pick up a little bit of benefit on the interest line year-over-year, as we were able to use the proceeds from dental sale much more quickly than we anticipated. So we got a little bit of favorable benefit. But again, those are pennies here and there. It doesn't really change our full year outlook.
Jason Bednar: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.
Dan Carestio: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question will come from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Dave Turkaly: Hey. Good morning. Can you hear me?
Dan Carestio: Yeah.
Julie Winter: Yeah.
Dave Turkaly: Thanks. Just where we look at the BD ad that you guys did, does that sit primarily in consumables, in the Healthcare business like from a mix standpoint? And I think you said it was similar margin to your core, but I just wanted to reconfirm that.
Dan Carestio: Yes, on both. It is classified as consumables in our Healthcare mix.
Julie Winter: 90%, Dave is in consumables in the last time that that, containers are there in the capital bucket.
Dan Carestio: Yeah.
Dave Turkaly: Thank you for that. And then, I think, you have a restructuring plan underway. And I don't recall exactly the size or the timing. But any detail on that?
Mike Tokich: Yeah. We had announced last quarter that we had a $100 million restructuring plan. The bulk of that was for a closure of 1 of our manufacturing facilities. That will continue to occur throughout this year. We've got about a $25 million benefit coming from that, but the bulk of that benefit will happen in fiscal year 2026, not in 2025.
Dave Turkaly: Great. And last one and I saw the increase in the dividend, obviously, 19 years is a pretty good track record. But as you look at M&A and share repo, I guess, some other capital priorities, anything changed on that front given what we're seeing out there and maybe even the valuation of some the smaller peers in the space?
Dan Carestio: No. I mean, our investment priorities remain the same. And we don't really talk about forward-looking M&A. But we have a history of being active and obviously, we're in a good position in terms of debt. And if opportunities present themselves over the coming years, we will obviously do what we normally do.
Dave Turkaly: Thank you.
Dan Carestio: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Polark: Just one more, please, for the model. The interest in other line, I heard the discrete items called out in the quarter. What is a good number with your pro forma balance sheet now for that line on a quarterly basis for the rest of this year?
Mike Tokich: On a quarterly basis, I don't have that in front of me, but for a full year basis, we're still looking at about $100 million in total.
Michael Polark: Okay. I'll -- we can take that offline. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Mike Tokich: Yeah. I just don't have it in front of me, Mike.
Michael Polark: Thanks.
Operator: And with that, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Julie Winter, for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. Look forward to catching up with many of you, in the coming day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-05-09 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the STERIS plc Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Winter of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. As usual, on today's call, we will have Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO, and I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are -- or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' Securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth, and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our release as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie and good morning everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our performance. As you saw in the press release, we finished the year strong with total revenue growth of 10% in the fourth quarter and constant currency organic revenue growth of 6%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $2.58. For the full year, we exceeded expectations with 12% total revenue growth and constant currency organic revenue growth of 9%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share totaled $8.83 exceeding our outlook. With the announcement of the divestiture of the Dental segment, we are required to report results from continuing operations starting now. As a result, the rest of our comments today will be focused on results from continuing operations. Contained within the numerous press release tables, you will find an eight-quarter recast -- results from continuing and discontinued operations to help with year-over-year comparisons. Turning to continuing operations, fourth quarter constant currency organic revenue grew 7%, driven by volume as well as 240 basis points of price. This is impressive when compared to the strong fourth quarter last year. Once again, our Healthcare segment exceeded expectations. During the quarter, Healthcare shipped a record $332 million in capital equipment. Gross margin for the quarter declined 80 basis points with the prior -- compared to the prior year to 42.6%. Positive price and productivity were more than offset by negative segment mix and increased materials and labor costs. EBIT margin decreased 30 basis points to 23.7% of revenue compared with the fourth quarter last year. The operating income mix shift between Healthcare and AST once again impacted our margins. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%, lower than we anticipated due to several favorable discrete item adjustments. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $240.5 million and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.41. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 totaled $360 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $565 million. Total debt sits at $3.2 billion and our total debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 2.1 times gross leverage. Free cash flow for fiscal 2024 was $620 million as we benefited from higher generation from cash from operations, including less use of cash for working capital requirements. With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Thank you for making the time to join us today. Mike already covered the fourth quarter, so I will focus on our fiscal 2024 segment performance and our outlook for fiscal 2025 for continuing operations. Fiscal 2024 turned out to be a strong year for STERIS. As you've heard from us previously, Healthcare has consistently outperformed all year ending fiscal 2024 with 13% constant currency organic revenue growth, the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for this segment. The single biggest driver was the work done by our operations teams to reduce lead times, and as a result, return our backlog back-to-normal levels. I am pleased to report that as of the fourth quarter, our lead-times are back to pre-pandemic levels for the first time in two years. As a result, Healthcare backlog is also now hovering around what we believe to be the new normal at just over $350 million. Service and consumables each had strong organic revenue growth for the fiscal year as we continue to benefit from the breadth of our offering and the size and quality of our service teams. AST grew 3% constant currency organic for the year, which is unusually light, but ended up with improving service revenue growth, for example, in the fourth quarter, service revenue grew 7%, which is a mixture of double-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and low single-digit revenue growth in EMEA. While it is early days, bioprocessing demand seems to have stabilized and did not unfavorably impact our performance in the quarter. This is a positive step forward. We do not expect to return to meaningful bioprocessing growth until the second half of fiscal 2025, aligned with the comments that you have been hearing from our public company customers. Life Sciences ended fiscal 2024 in line with our long-term expectations at 6% constant currency organic revenue growth. The path may have swerved a bit more than we're used to, but a solid year for the segment overall. In particular, double-digit revenue growth in service for the year is an impressive achievement as we continue to win new contracts and see improved parts sales. Considering some of the macro challenging facing the pharma sector, we are pleased with the Life Sciences segment results. Turning to our updated outlook. Fiscal 2025 will be another strong year for STERIS. As-reported revenue from continuing operations is expected to increase 6.5% to 7.5% for fiscal 2025. This includes the additional four months of the BD acquisition, a full year impact from the divestiture of our Controlled Environmental Services business within the Life Sciences segment, and neutral foreign currency. Constant currency organic revenue growth from continuing operations is expected to be 6% to 7%. For your modeling, our expectation that the segment level for constant currency organic revenue growth is that AST grows high single-digits for the year with growth accelerating in the second half. Healthcare is anticipated to grow mid-single-digits and Life Sciences expected to grow low single-digits. As a reminder, our first quarter of fiscal 2024 was particularly strong with high teens growth in Healthcare. EBIT margins are expected to improve for the year as some headwinds from fiscal 2024 abate. As a result, adjusted earnings per diluted share coming from continuing operations are anticipated to increase 10% to 13% at a range of $9.05 to $9.25. This outlook assumes that the divestiture of the Dental segment closes in the first quarter, and the proceeds are primarily used to repay variable rate debt. Our earnings split for revenue is anticipated to be 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half. Before we conclude, I do want to make a few remarks on the strategic plan we have been executing during fiscal 2024. After significant review, we decided we needed to improve focus on our core customers in healthcare, pharma, and MedTech as well as areas where we can achieve sustainable and profitable growth. As a result, we made a decision to divest two businesses during the year, most notably the Dental segment. In addition, today, we announced a targeted restructuring plan, which includes restructuring of the Healthcare Surgical Capital business in Europe as well as other actions, including impairment of an internally developed high-capacity X-ray accelerator, product rationalizations, and facility consolidations. Combined, these actions allow us to focus on our core business and deliver on the long-term commitments we have made to our investors. We are confident that with these changes, we have the right portfolio, sales channels, and network of facilities to deliver to our customers over the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, will you please give the instructions, so we can begin the Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Chuck, if you'll give the instructions, we can open for Q&A.
Operator: Yes ma'am. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Patrick Wood: Fantastic. Thank you. Just a couple from me. Maybe to start with a dull guidance one. On the Healthcare side of things, mid-single-digit growth makes sense. Obviously, you've got a very tough comp on the capital equipment side. And I'm just curious how you're thinking about that. Obviously, Q1 is very tough, but the interplay between the order books and that coming through. Is the assumption that you can keep that capital equipment business in growth? Or is the guidance assuming it's kind of flat? I'm just trying to get a sense for how much of that mid-single-digit in Healthcare is contingent on the capital equipment side within Healthcare?
Dan Carestio: Hey Patrick, thanks. This is Dan. Yes, our expectation is that we can have very low single-digit growth on the capital side of the business in Healthcare. If you look at the last five months or the last four quarters, rather, I'm sorry, I misspoke there, we kind of shipped an extra quarter of capital during the fiscal 2024 because in 2023, we had the challenges with supply chain, which pushed out delivery. So, we had a huge Q1, which is abnormal for us. And then we finish strong as we typically do in Q4. So, there was a bit of a timing issue there that's affecting the comps going into next year. But nonetheless, we do expect that we can maintain the level and grow it a bit. We've had -- we've consistently had strong order books. And then the remaining growth is really the expectation on the momentum we've built in the services and then the consumables organizations for healthcare. And as we place more and more equipment, it drives more consumption of both sides of that business. And obviously, as we've seen some consistent recovery in procedural rates, those business are largely procedurally driven.
Patrick Wood: Got that. Thank you. And then just second, maybe a bit bigger picture. For the industry overall, there's been quite a lot of changes. We had the FDA sterilization town hall and then the EO regulatory side. I guess what are you seeing from the competitive environment? And how are you thinking the industry could change going forward vis-à-vis stuff like in-sourcing versus outsourcing? Just an update on the competitive environment and the, I guess, the challenges facing your customers, and where they decide to go with you or keep things in-house.
Dan Carestio: Well, I mean, Patrick, it's hard to say. What I would say is that STERIS is incredibly well-positioned as a technology-neutral and location-neutral company in terms of how we help our customers. And whether that means that we sell them accelerators for their own in-house deployment or VHP for their own in-house deployment for terminal sterilization or whether they use us in a large-scale contract situation where we've consistently continued our expansion efforts as we expect the growth in the industry to continue long-term. So, I believe from our perspective, we have done everything possibly to support our customers from a capacity, from in-house perspective and also from a regulatory perspective in terms of how we operate, but also working with the regulatory agencies on things like master files and changing classifications for alternative methods like vapor hydrogen peroxide to lower those barriers in terms of regulatory.
Patrick Wood: Always a lot going on. Thanks so much for taking the questions.
Mike Tokich: Sure. Thanks.
Operator: Next question will come from Brett Fishbin with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Brett Fishbin: Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I'm going to ask just one more on AST. I think it was really encouraging to see a little bit of progress in terms of growth in the service line this quarter. So, just curious if you could provide a little bit more color on where we stand in regards to the inventory overhang, specifically in Europe, given that was the reason that seemed to be lagging the most from an inventory standpoint?
Dan Carestio: Yes. Sure, Brett, this is Dan. I can speak to that, and thanks for the question. We really saw things turn in the U.S. market strongly in the second half of the year. And in terms of medical devices in that segment, if you put aside the bioprocessing overhang, we were growing at double-digits for most of the second half for those type of products. So, we've seen a full recovery here in the U.S. in terms of the inventory burn down. Europe has taken a little more time and at this point, I'm not so sure if it's just inventory, I think it's more procedure-driven, and there's still a slower recovery over there in terms of procedural backlog that needs to play out. Eventually, that's got to sort of sell through, right? And we believe with a high degree of confidence that in the second half of the year that we should see a robust turnaround in the European market in terms of overall consumption.
Brett Fishbin: All right. Super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the EPS guidance. Just curious if there was any impact to how you're thinking about either margins or EPS as a result of the incremental divestiture in Life Sciences? And if there's any financing considerations that we should be aware of for that deal?
Mike Tokich: No, that was a very small deal, but we wanted to point it out because it does have a negative impact on Life Sciences growth rates. But all-in-all, it was very small for us. So, no impact bottom-line.
Brett Fishbin: All right. Thank you
Operator: The next question will come from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple on the guidance. So first, can you remind us how much pricing you got for the full year for fiscal 2024? And then what have you assumed in the fiscal 2025 guidance for pricing?
Mike Tokich: Yes. So, for the full year of 2024, our total consolidated, total company price was 270 basis points favorable. And what we are assuming in our FY 2025 guidance is around 200 basis points of favorable price.
Mike Matson: Okay, got it. And then just in terms of M&A, with the dental divestiture, reducing your debt to some degree, should we expect near-term deals just given that additional capacity you're going to have?
Dan Carestio: Yes, Mike, this is Dan. What I would say is we have the capacity both financially and internally from a people perspective. As you know, we've been in the acquisition business for a number of years. We're good at it. We're good at integrating companies, but those opportunities have to present themselves and when they do, and when it's imminent, we'll be sure to talk about it.
Mike Matson: Okay, got it. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question will come from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Matt [ph] on for Jacob. I just want to follow-up on the guidance question asked earlier. Do you mind clarifying your first half, second half remarks, it seems like you may be guiding to like roughly 2% organic growth for the first half and maybe 10% plus for the second half, is that correct?
Julie Winter: The earnings split we provided was earnings, not revenue. And certainly based on that, we would expect growth to ramp up in the second half of the year. We don't -- to clarify, we don't guide to revenue split.
Unidentified Analyst: I appreciate that. And then on gamma radiation, I know you caught up on some gamma loading last quarter, but in the medium term, I believe a few years ago, there was some concern in the bioprocessing industry about the shortage of capacity. Do you have any thoughts on the current state of gamma supply versus demand as bioprocessing demand comes back? And what could this mean for your X-ray capacity as well?
Dan Carestio: Well, that's the basis of our X-ray expansion, and we have a number of sites that have come online and will come online over the next year -- two years, actually, in particular. So, we think we're well positioned to take advantage of the gap that does exist and will grow in terms of short-term supply of isotope versus the demand that they have for radiation processing.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Dan Carestio: Yes, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Jason Bednar: Hey good morning. Congrats on a nice finish to fiscal 2024, guys. I'll take maybe a little bit of a different swing here on the revenue pacing. I think you said AST acceleration over the course of the year. But is it right to think the -- for kind of company-wide level, first half of the year, maybe a tick or two below the full year organic guide second half, a little bit above, I think we're all just trying to dial in and make sure we're not too back-end loaded with your -- with our models based on what you're guiding to today?
Mike Tokich: Yes, our comparisons are tough in both Q1 and obviously now with the strong finish in Q4, but I would agree that the first half would be a little bit lighter, both from a revenue standpoint and from a margin standpoint.
Jason Bednar: All right. Perfect, thanks Mike. And I'll ask a question here to follow up on Patrick's question earlier. So, if you could help us out, if backlog is back to normal levels, I guess, why wouldn't healthcare equipment revenue moderate unless you're expecting meaningful order growth to compensate for what was an above-normal level of backlog reductions last year? I'm just really trying to reconcile those points.
Dan Carestio: Yes. At a high level, I would say, although we pushed out a lot of product last year because we had built up a huge backlog. The demand for our products remains high. And if you look at what our annual order intake looks like today versus four years ago, it's significantly higher. I think we had a bit of an anomaly last year, but we don't expect our general order rates to really slow down. We believe that we're well positioned with our portfolio. We're winning more than our share I believe, in terms of capital projects, in particular, on the IPT side of the business, and we would expect that to continue.
Jason Bednar: All right. But I guess, Dan, just as a quick follow-up there, sorry to monopolize here, but if your lead times are back to pre-normal levels, I mean, unless you're turning that backlog quicker doesn't that necessarily imply that you're not going to be growing healthcare equipment at the same pace? I'm just -- something is still missing, maybe we can follow-up offline, I'm still having a hard time piecing that together.
Julie Winter: Jason, just to clarify, clearly, we're not saying we're going to grow at the same pace, but we are expecting to grow, right? So, down from the double-digit growth we've been doing to low single-digit growth is our expectation.
Jason Bednar: Okay. All right. Thanks Julie.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thank you, everyone for taking the time to join us this morning. I look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming days.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-02-08 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome to the STERIS plc Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. And I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our release as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 10% driven by volume as well as 270 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 50 basis points compared with the prior year to 43.6%. Price more than offset continued material and labor inflation in addition to the negative impact from currency. EBIT margin decreased 80 basis points to 23.1% of revenue compared with the third quarter last year. The anticipated increase in our year-over-year incentive compensation expense, along with the mix shift in operating income from the AST segment to the Healthcare segment impacted EBIT margins. We anticipate that the mix shift in operating income from AST to Healthcare will continue in the fourth quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.6%. Net income in the quarter was $220.9 million and adjusted earnings were $2.22 per diluted share. Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of fiscal '24 totaled $268.8 million while depreciation and amortization totaled $430.8 million. Debt declined slightly to $3.3 billion in the third quarter. Total debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 2.2x gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of fiscal 2024 was $457 million compared with $262.8 million for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2024 increase was driven by higher earnings and declines in cash used for tax and compensation-related payments as well as a decline in capital expenditures. With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us to hear more about our third quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, our third quarter continued the momentum we have experienced in our Healthcare segment in the past few quarters and we also saw a nice improvement in Life Sciences. Overall, we are pleased with our performance. We continue to expect that our Healthcare segment will outperform our original expectations for the fiscal year, offsetting macro challenges impacting demand in our other segments. Looking at our segments; healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 12% in the quarter. Supporting that performance, we had double-digit growth across capital equipment, consumables and service again this quarter. This is driven primarily by procedure volume rebound in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains. As anticipated, backlog continues to normalize as we are shipping at a faster pace than new orders are coming in. Remember, our goal is to get back to historic production lead times and continue to meet customer demand. Speaking of demand, capital equipment orders in the Healthcare segment grew double digits in the quarter. Turning to AST; constant currency organic revenue grew 4% which was below our expectations. While we have continued to see more normalized volumes in the U.S. for medtech, outside of the U.S. remains softer than anticipated. In addition, bioprocessing volumes continue to contract. Until we have more clarity, we are taking a more conservative approach to our expectations for the fourth quarter. Life Sciences grew 20% in the quarter on a constant currency organic basis. We had another strong quarter of capital shipments which grew 57% against relatively easy comparisons. Remember, in fiscal 2023, revenue for both capital equipment and consumables was shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter due to some supply chain constraints. Consumables grew 8% and service revenue increased 12%. As you're hearing from others in the space, short-term demand remains a bit murky and we continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for this segment. Our Dental segment third quarter revenue declined 6% on a constant currency organic basis. Revenue is limited by reduced orders from a large customer due to a temporary disruption of their operations as a result of a cybersecurity incident they experienced during the quarter. Excluding that disruption, revenue would have been about flat in the quarter which reflects the decline in patient volumes. The lower volume, combined with the continued increases in material costs led to a decline in EBIT margin for the quarter. Turning to our outlook. Fiscal 2024 is shaping up to be another strong year for STERIS, albeit not exactly the way we had anticipated. In the last few years, if they've taught us anything, it's the value of our diversified portfolio. Time and time again, we have benefited as one of our segments outperforms to compensate for challenges elsewhere. We are updating our outlook for the year to increase revenue to reflect the continued outperformance of our Healthcare segment. For the year, we now expect total revenue to grow 10% to 11% on a constant currency organic basis -- I'm sorry and constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, each up 100 basis points from our prior ranges. This assumes low single-digit constant currency organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter caused by the record-setting shipments in last year's fourth quarter. EBIT margins for the fiscal year will decline slightly from fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting the shift in operating income mix from AST to Healthcare. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are now anticipated to be in the range of $8.60 to $8.70 for fiscal 2024. We recognize this outlook includes some conservatism but believe it is warranted until we see the AST customer destocking abate and have additional clarity on bioprocessing volumes. That concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions and we can begin the Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, if you can give the instructions, we'll get started on Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Patrick Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Patrick Wood: You guys still run one of the most efficient earnings calls of all time. It's much appreciated. I guess maybe starting with Healthcare. As you said, double-digit growth across kind of all three of the main verticals. I'd love to unpack that a little bit. I mean within the capital equipment side, I think last quarter was sort of 65%, let's call it, sort of replacement style projects and then roughly 1/3 kind of expansionary. Is that the same kind of thing you're seeing now? And should we expect that consumables line to remain pretty strong given the sheer amount of equipment you guys have been installing through this year if we look forward?
Dan Carestio: Yes. I'll take the consumables. Mike, if you want to take the capital. Patrick, what I would say is the consumables is a function of really two things. One is obviously, patient demand in terms of procedures. And obviously, at least in the North American markets, demand is up across the board in terms of volumes flowing through hospitals. And then the other factor on that is just the sheer number of placements that we put out there over the last year in terms of maybe a little bit of share gain.
Mike Tokich: And then on the capital side, obviously, you see that we continue to reduce our backlog levels which is getting us more to our more normalized historic lead times and continuing to meet customer demand. But included in that, we did have double-digit orders growth within Healthcare in the third quarter. So strong shipments in the quarter but also good outlook with that double-digit growth in orders for future.
Patrick Wood: Amazing. And then maybe just quickly on AST. I guess within bioprocessing, the companies there themselves struggle to forecast their own demand kind of famously. So I wouldn't want to necessarily put too much stock there. But the commentary seems generally more optimistic on the forward look, I would say, from some of the big players. Is that something that you think resonates with you as you move through the next few quarters, like things on the bioprocessing side get a little bit better? And then equally within AST, that -- how far through do you think we are in that inventory burn down given the procedure volumes have been so strong. I would have thought we don't have too long of that left. Is that fair?
Dan Carestio: Yes. We would have thought that too, Patrick. So what I would say is that we've seen the turn in the U.S. market, for the most part, in medtech destocking. And that's a function of the efficiency of the healthcare systems over here and procedure volumes up being up significantly. They've been able -- our customers been able to burn down that inventory a little quicker. In Europe, where there's still a lot of fits and starts in terms of medical procedures depending on the countries, we have not seen the burn down yet in inventory. And -- but inevitably, this can't go on forever. I mean eventually, those lines will cross. And then as it relates to the bioprocessing destocking, if we look over the long term, historically and going forward, with the exception of the blip that occurred for a couple of years during the pandemic, more than a blip to spike, it has been a very solid strong growth subset of products that we sterilize. And inevitably, I do believe that it will return to those levels of growth off of the reset number. The question is when do we get to that reset number? And as you've heard from many of our customers in their earnings and their outlook, they're taking a fairly conservative approach to the first half of the calendar year but believe that many of them will see meaningful growth in the high single digits in the second half. If that comes true, that will translate to volumes for our AST business.
Patrick Wood: Having been treated in both the U.K. and the U.S., I'm glad I live here from healthcare perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc.
Brett Fishbin: Just wanted to start off with a question on some of the margin dynamics. Understand the unfavorable revenue mix shift was the primary moving piece this quarter. But just wondering if you could give a bit more color on some of the previous key moving pieces around margins like productivity and cost inflation and how those have progressed into the back half?
Mike Tokich: Yes, Brett. The one thing we are missing that I did talk about, we've been talking about all year is the incentive comp hole that we had to refill which was about a $40 million headwind. The bulk of that, about $22 million of that was impacted in the third quarter. So that is a huge hole that we had to fill in Q3. On the more favorable positive side, we have seen price for the first time actually offset labor inflation. And we did see flat productivity. We had seen negative productivity as we were moving, as we talked about moving products, especially the capital equipment and touching those products several times in order to get them out the door in our manufacturing process. So we've actually seen an improvement -- significant improvement in productivity. I think productivity was right around negative 150, 200 basis points last quarter and it's flat this quarter. So very good movement there from a manufacturing standpoint. That just shows that from a supply chain standpoint, we are seeing our supply chain continuing to ease and doing a nice job of reducing our backlog and getting back to more normalized lead times.
Brett Fishbin: All right. Great. And then just one other follow-up, a little bit of a longer-term question around AST. Just wondering if you could provide a bit of an update around your progress in adding more X-ray sterilization capacity as an alternative modality across your network. If I'm not mistaken, you have a couple of locations already up and running. And I think there are some additional ones that might come online in the next few years. So just any additional details would be great.
Dan Carestio: Yes, sure. This is Dan. The two of the U.S. sites will come online this calendar year. That's in Chicago, Libertyville, Illinois area that is in testing phase now and should be running product in the next few months. And then the second one that will come online will be California, Ontario, California and that will be in the fall.
Julie Winter: And then outside of the U.S., we have several projects underway.
Dan Carestio: We do. Yes. I mean we have the Asian site coming online as well now. And then I don't -- I can't remember off the top of my head the pacing of a couple of the European sites but there's a few of those that will come online in the next 18 months as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson from Stephens.
Jacob Johnson: Maybe just one on margins to start. Just on AST margins, I think they declined sequentially on a similar revenue base. What was that mix? Was that incentive comp? Just anything you'd call out there? And any thoughts on how we should think about that into the fourth quarter?
Dan Carestio: A general comment, Mike, I'll let you add to it. We typically see some decline in Q3 and that's because of the holidays, right? So we're not -- there's not as many days of billing that goes on because customers have shutdowns often over the Thanksgiving week and over the Christmas holiday week between Christmas and New Year. So unless we're sitting on backlog in the factories, we tend to lose some time there. So as a result, it has an impact on margin. But that's a normal sequential trend that we see from Q2 to Q3. Unless there has been a few times in history where that has not -- we bucked that trend because bioprocessing volumes was through the roof or something. We had to run a burn-off backlog. But generally speaking, that's a normal thing you would expect. It's probably a bit exaggerated by the fact that we saw a much lower volume than anticipated in the European plants.
Mike Tokich: And we did have some cobalt loadings where we actually took our plants off of line for the quarter. I think we had six or eight cobalt loading. So that also hurt from a productivity standpoint which negatively impacted margins, yes.
Jacob Johnson: Got it. And then just maybe as a follow-up on the Life Sciences segment, obviously, strong performance. Dan, it seems like from your comments, some of that was just easy comps but you also kind of struck some maybe positive tone around the longer-term outlook there. I'm just curious kind of what you're seeing in terms of demand there as it relates to aseptic manufacturing clients because that's been in focus somewhat this week?
Dan Carestio: Yes. It's funny. In the Life Science business, when we ship in revenue product, that's really the anxious history for us because oftentimes, those are orders booked a year in advance. And we -- as you indicated, we had really fairly easy comparisons to our Q3 last year in terms of shipments. And then if you recall, we had a really nice Q4. So I think it's those two things. We're not ready to raise the flag yet in terms of a long-term view of what's going on in aseptic manufacturing demand. We know that the long term is a great outlook. But short term, there's still some destocking that's going on and there's still some pressure on big pharma right now. But in generally, long term, clearly aseptic drugs, injectable drugs, biologics, cell and gene therapy, all those type of things, all those markets we serve with sterilization type products and services are going to be in high demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: Might be too early but I'd be curious for puts and takes as we move into fiscal '25. Penciling out the model here last night, see a path to 6% organic revenue growth, maybe a touch better pending AST and the historical STERIS posture on EBIT margin, 30, 50 bps of expansion and that feels fair for now. I just -- as you get ready to plan for next year, do you feel like the environment allows for -- I mean, at -- knowing there's portfolio puts and takes but at an overall STERIS level, do you feel like it sets you out to shoot for that normal STERIS algorithm? Or do you see it differently at this early stage?
Mike Tokich: Mike, your opening comment it's a bit too early for us to comment at this point in time. You answered your own question there a little bit. Obviously, we're in the middle of our planning process. We will, as we typically do, provide FY '25 guidance in May on our full year fourth quarter call. So that's where we stand right now.
Michael Polark: Had to try. AST -- I guess the AST question is two-part. Obviously, we see procedures are back. I mean medtech probably behaving well. You're saying the U.S. is good. OUS, still a little iffy. OUS, is there any kind of COVID product category that's still contributing to this? I'm thinking of PPE? Or is it just the European kind of procedure recovery is more sober and that's it?
Dan Carestio: That's it. It's specific to Europe, too, because we've seen pretty decent recovery in our Asia Pacific plants. So this is a predominantly European demand issue that's just well, not necessarily demand, its ability to deliver health care issue that's taking longer to burn down inventories.
Michael Polark: The second piece, it's just like large interventional multinational medtechs, I'm thinking hips, knees, stents, pacers, stuff like this. Are these customers telling you that they maybe have a little too much that need to be slower on ordering? Or are you just -- you're not hearing that and you're just...
Dan Carestio: That's the communication we get -- we've received from customers. We've had -- many say that they're burning down inventory as much as 40% from where their current levels were. That's a function of what happened during the pandemic and post pandemic and inventory in the supply chains and manufacturing and raw and everything got fairly bloated because of concerns around the surety of supply and that compounded with a reduction in procedure rates over and Europe is taking longer to burn it down.
Operator: And our next question is from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler.
Jason Bednar: I'll start first, following up maybe on some of the prior questions on segment margins. I was going to take a stab at fiscal '25 but Mike already tried that. So I'll go a different route. It sounds on the margin side, like you're not too worried about the AST profit level. We saw third quarter is the seasonal low point. But is there anything structural keeping us from getting back to the upper 40% margin levels we saw in fiscal '22 and the first part of '23? Or are those just tough to match given the volume lift you were seeing at the time. And then similar question but on the other side, in Healthcare, how sustainable do you see segment margins in that segment? I think it hit a new high this quarter. Is the strength there simply a function of the consumables and equipment volumes you're seeing? Or is there any kind of uplift that's coming from the assets you acquired from BD.
Mike Tokich: On the AST side, it's all volume, Jason. This is a very high fixed cost base segment. The more volume we put through, the better opportunity we have to drive increased EBIT margin. So there, it's all volume. Dan, do you want to address Healthcare.
Dan Carestio: Yes. No, I don't see any fundamental changes really in Healthcare. It's that, once again, as long as our delivery rates stay up high, it should be fairly consistent, plus or minus a -- a bit different to one way or another from quarter-to-quarter.
Julie Winter: And BD is slightly incremental, Mike [ph].
Jason Bednar: Okay. I don't want to lead either of you but it sounds like Mike, you're saying nothing structural from getting from tariffs getting back to the upper 40s in AST. And Dan, you're saying nothing structural that would keep you from maintaining the margin level you're at right now in Healthcare.
Dan Carestio: Yes. Correct.
Jason Bednar: Okay. All right, great. And then over on Dental, I'm sorry, I probably have asked this a few different times now in consecutive calls, you've been reviewing internally the future plans for the asset. This was a weak quarter, part of that out of your control, you had Henry Schein cybersecurity attack. But I guess maybe two questions on those items. Can you say first, whether near-term trends have normalized following that cybersecurity attack and the kind of the resolution we've seen with that business and that issue? And then can you talk about the conversations you're having regarding the future for this segment, do you have a time line on when you'll announce the formal decision here?
Dan Carestio: Yes. I guess on the first, we have seen things normalize in terms of regular order base and whatnot. The challenge is a lot of that revenue kind of evaporated and get shifted into Q4 is at least is what we anticipate to some degree or found other venues to get to the customer which we don't really have the ability to track or fully understand. So we'll see what the outcome is of that more definitively this quarter. On the other question, we continue to look at the portfolio in general but no decisions have been made at this point. And as soon as we have something to update you and everyone else with on this matter, we will do so.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company.
Michael Matson: I just want to ask one on use of cash. So I think you've done a fair bit of M&A. I don't recall any recent share repurchases but maybe I'm forgetting one. But can you maybe just give us an update on your kind of priorities and whether or not you'd be willing to kind of come in and do some share repurchasing?
Mike Tokich: Yes, Mike, our capital allocation methodology process has not really changed over the last decade plus. We did, if you remember last year in the fourth quarter, we did -- we were opportunistic in share repurchase. We bought about $225-ish million of shares. We have not purchased any in FY '24 to date. We've actually been focusing more on paying down debt since rates are higher. We feel there's value in paying down debt. So all of our excess cash has been going towards debt repayment which has driven our leverage ratio even with the BD acquisition, we're at 2.2x gross leverage. So that's been our focus.
Michael Matson: Okay, got it. And then, I believe you've been able to get a little more pricing in recent periods. How sustainable do you think that, that rate of price increases as we see inflation kind of slowing down here a bit.
Dan Carestio: Yes, I think that to some extent, our ability to justify putting through price increases with customers has to be some basis of cost. And as costs can normalize in certain areas, there will be a market trend towards less price grab, I guess, what I would say.
Michael Matson: Okay. And then finally, the last one on the outlook for tax rate with Pillar Two. I mean your rate is kind of well above that 15% level. But do you expect any sort of impact there to your tax rate?
Mike Tokich: Mike, nothing material from Pillar Two, if and when it does get implemented.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities.
David Turkaly: Bouncing around a bit, you may have talked about this but I wanted to just ask quickly. Any update on that radiation sterilization master pilot program, like in terms of participation or anything we should assume. Anything you've learned or anything you think we could look at in terms of how that might impact things moving forward?
Dan Carestio: Yes, Dave, this is Dan. It's been very positively received by the customers and also by the regulators with the agency, FDA and we're excited about the program because it does sort of create a lower regulatory barrier, switching barrier for our customers to have more supply chain flexibility when changing different modes of sterilization. So this is something that we felt was important to offer up to the industry and work with the FDA to get that approved. So that there was much more flexibility at a time a couple of years ago when everybody was exposed and challenged. So no material impact in the short term here. Do we expect -- but I think that longer term, it's a great program for us and bodes well for our customers.
David Turkaly: And then just quickly as a follow-up, when you look at like EO, if they're transferring from that, like -- is the margin profile much different via the different modes in AST that they might switch to?
Dan Carestio: Not really, no.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: Healthcare capital, as I kind of run -- review the numbers or the fresh set of numbers. And I know -- so that how you manage it? You have customers waiting for product and you want to ship as quickly as possible? But I kind of see the makings of a soft landing here for Healthcare capital revenue in '25. There had been a fear that it might likely be down as you kind of improve lead times and conversion rates. But again, I kind of see this kind of Goldilocks scenario where growth decels for sure but assuming orders continue at these current levels, you're still growing Healthcare capital revenue in fiscal '25. I know you don't have guidance out there but I'm curious what you think of my theory?
Dan Carestio: I love your theory and I hope it plays out that way.
Michael Polark: Okay. I had one other follow-up. Cobalt 60, I heard the comments on maybe a little bit of downtime from loading and we obviously know that Nordion was exceptionally calendar 4Q weighted in terms of deliveries in calendar '23. Is there some element that now that you're back to like full strength at those plants, the gamma network speeds up in the short run. I'm just curious how that actually works.
Dan Carestio: It does but we have to have the volume is the issue. So we needed to take the cobalt because we've gotten to a deficit position in many of those plants because it's been for some of them over a year since they last loaded. But it doesn't -- it should not have a material effect unless we get more volume than we anticipate. And if we do, we'll be able to run it because we'll have more capacity.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks, Jamie and thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. We look forward to catching up with many of you in the coming weeks.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q2  (2023-11-08 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the STERIS plc Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Julie Winter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. And I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our release as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 8% driven by volume as well as 330 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 50 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.3%. The favorable price was more than offset by lower productivity and continued material and labor inflation. EBIT margin decreased 130 basis points to 22.5% of revenue, compared with the second quarter last year, which reflects the decline in gross margin as well as the anticipated increase in year-over-year incentive compensation expense. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7%. Net income in the quarter was $202.2 million and adjusted earnings were $2.03 per diluted share. Capital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2024 totaled $149.9 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $290.2 million. We are adjusting our capital spending outlook for fiscal 2024, down from $375 million to $310 million. This change reflects the timing of projects for our AST business. This change will allow us to offset higher-than-planned inventory levels, keeping free cash flow outlook for fiscal 2024 at approximately $685 million. Debt increased to $3.4 billion in the second quarter, reflecting borrowings to fund the acquisition of the BD assets. Total debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 2.3x gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2024 was $284.7 million as we benefited from lower capital spending and a decline in cash used for tax and compensation related payments. Inventory remains elevated as we continue to focus on reducing lead times and meeting customer demand. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for making the time to join us to hear more about our second quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, our second quarter continued the momentum we have experienced in our Healthcare segment for the past few quarters. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the Healthcare segment and is anticipated to outperform our original expectations for the fiscal year, offsetting the macro challenges impacting demand in our other segments. Looking at our segments. Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 14% in the quarter. We experienced double-digit growth across capital equipment, consumables and service again this quarter. This is driven primarily by procedure volume rebound in the U.S. as well as price and market share gains. As anticipated, our backlog has reduced as we were able to ship at a faster pace than new orders are coming in as we get back to normal lead times for our customers. During the first half, we saw strength in replacement orders, representing 65% of our total orders in Healthcare. We are increasingly confident in our expectations of a strong year for our Healthcare segment. Growth will, however decelerate in the second half as we face very challenging comparisons in the fourth quarter. Turning to AST, constant currency organic revenue declined 1%. While our services business grew 5%, our capital equipment business declined due to the timing of large shipments. In addition, our performance in the quarter continued to be impacted by two short-term situations; inventory destocking in the Medtech space and the year-over-year market decline of the bioprocessing customer demand. We do see very positive signs of recovery in the Medtech demand. We saw good growth in the U.S. during the quarter, reflecting the improving procedure environment and the burn down of customer inventory. We continue to see weakness, however, in the European markets where procedure recovery is taking a bit longer to take hold. From a bioprocessing perspective, as we have said, FY '24 represents a bit of a reset, and we do not anticipate returning to year-over-year growth in bioprocessing in fiscal 2024. As we head into the second half, our comps ease as it was the third quarter of fiscal 2023 when we first witnessed declines in bioprocessing. Based on these factors, our outlook continues to reflect very strong growth in the second half of the fiscal year for our AST segment as compared to the first half. Life Sciences revenue grew 5% in the quarter on a constant currency organic basis as the delayed capital shipments from the first quarter were recognized contributing to 18% growth in capital equipment. Consumables grew 4% and service was flat. As you are hearing from many others in the space, the short-term demand remains a bit murky. We continue, however, to be very optimistic about the long-term trends driving demand for aseptic manufacturing in biopharma. Our Dental segment, second quarter revenue declined 6% on a constant currency organic basis as revenue was limited by customer destocking of inventory, in particular, for infection control products. Despite these challenges, we are impressed with the ability of the business to sequentially improve margins, delivering EBIT margins above total company in the quarter. All in, we are pleased with the first half of the fiscal year. U.S. procedure trends continue to shift in a positive direction, supply chain challenges have largely abated and our ability to execute and ship capital products to our delivery times has greatly improved. That said, there are still pockets of uncertainty, which remain outside of our Healthcare segment. We are maintaining our expectations of 6% to 7% constant currency organic revenue growth for fiscal 2024 as we expect a strong third quarter followed by a very tough fourth quarter comparisons, which will limit our total growth in the second half. In addition, from an earnings perspective, we now have an additional headwind from currency of about $0.05, which we are absorbing in our current outlook of $8.60 to $8.80. That concludes our prepared remarks for the call. Julie, would you please give the instructions and we can start the Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we can get started.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Johnson Jacob from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Jacob Johnson: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Dan or Mike following up on kind of the last comments and the 2024 outlook. It seems like some of the year is playing out as expected, and I appreciate the comps, but -- it also seems like Healthcare is going better than expected. Can you just talk about the other three segments and where things have changed the most? I think reading the material, Dan, maybe it seems like Life Sciences is the biggest delta since the beginning of the year, but just curious kind of how those other three segments are playing out this year versus original expectations?
Dan Carestio: Yes. I mean I think we still expect to deliver a good year in Life Sciences. It's just there's still some continued destocking going on in the space. And you see this across, everybody that's reported that sells either tools or disposables into the biopharma and pharma industries, in general. It's been announced in the last month or so that Pfizer is doing a $3.5 billion cut. And other -- some other pharma companies are sort of following suite. So generally speaking, we see -- when we see that start to happen, there'll be a short-term pullback in the industry. But the long-term outlook for biopharma and aseptic manufacturing, which is really our sweet space is really positive, and we have a great portfolio and expect to do well. In terms of the AST business, as I mentioned, we've seen a positive trend in the U.S. I think the procedures have crossed over with sort of the excess inventory that was out there in the past quarter, and we're seeing very positive growth from our Medtech customers. In terms of Europe, it's taken a bit longer for that to happen. There's been a lot of strikes and there's been a lot of labor shortages in Europe and just have not mobilized healthcare delivery in many places the way the U.S. has to date. Eventually, that will abate and even if doesn't eventually, they're going to burn down the inventories and access that they have sitting around. And I would have expected that around the time that we saw it in the U.S., I think as I've mentioned in previous calls, we expected sometime in the Fall time period. That's still the case. That could burn into the winter, I guess. But generally speaking, it's a matter of weeks or a few months, not quarters at this point. And then I think we've covered bioprocessing at length. Last year, Q2 was our high point, and then we started seeing it slowing in Q3 and ultimately sort of bottomed out by Q1 of our fiscal year, give or take. So the comps get easier for us in the second half for that in terms of our performance, especially as we get into Q4 and then next fiscal year.
Jacob Johnson: Got it. Thanks for all that. Just I guess, my follow-up. Just on backlog, both Healthcare and Life Sciences down sequentially. Is it fair to say healthcare is more about kind of execution and you catching up on lead times and maybe Life Sciences a little bit at the macro or anything else you'd share on that?
Dan Carestio: Yes, no, I would say both, are just getting products out the door. We had a lot of stuff that was supposed to move out in the prior quarter in Life Sciences, in particular, that slipped till the end of the quarter and didn't get recognized until this quarter. So that's just purely a timing issue, and orders remain pretty strong. And we've just been able to get a lot more stuff out of our factories as we bring our lead times down pretty significantly. So we just had a great delivery quarter for capital and general cross-post businesses.
Jacob Johnson: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Dan Carestio: Sure, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
David Turkaly: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask one follow-up on the AST side. It seems like we have some companies that are saying demand is super high. They're actually like experiencing bottlenecks to get devices sterilized, and you mentioned the timing of projects for AST. I'm just curious, is there a shift going on between some of the modalities there? Or what exactly the Medtech customer inventory that you're highlighting are you seeing?
Dan Carestio: Well, like I said, we have seen demand come back really strong in the U.S. market in the past quarter, back to what I would consider sort of normalized growth rates versus what we saw for the past two or three quarters. It's taken a bit longer for that recovery to happen outside of the U.S. The plants are busy in North America, and they're not as busy I would get -- I guess, is what I would say outside of the U.S. We expect that to change in the next quarter or so.
Julie Winter: And Dave, the shortages, I think, have been more tied to EO sterilization.
Dan Carestio: Yes.
Julie Winter: Where our softness has been on the radiation side.
Dan Carestio: Yes.
David Turkaly: That makes sense. And then maybe just a follow-up for Julie or the team that master filed the pilot program. I'm just curious as to what you think that means for you? Obviously, it's -- I think you said it's -- STERIS is first, but I don't know how to sort of analyze that or what you think that will mean for you moving forward?
Dan Carestio: Yes. So -- Dave, so what it does is it really gives our customers the ability to significantly improve and build much more resilient supply chains. Specifically, it allows them to switch between different modes of sterilization, whether that's EO to X-ray or gamma to X-ray or even e-beam to gamma or even to switch within our network of either our facilities or technologies without having to do a massive refile from a regulatory perspective. So products that are under 510(k) would not have to do a refile effectively. They would enter under our master file program. And then when they had their next normal sort of course of audits from the agency, they would check their records just to make sure everything was in place. But it lowers a significant regulatory hurdle, I would say, that allows customers to build a much more resiliency and also switch between technologies.
David Turkaly: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Polark: Hey, good morning. AST question for the back half. It obviously, the segment has the Mevex in it and you break it out, so that's helpful. Not a lot of Mevex in the front half. Can you help level set how much Mevex you expect in the back half?
Mike Tokich: In the second half, it will be less than $15 million of total revenue versus the first half, which was about $3 million. Again, not material, but unfortunately, year-over-year, the percentages are large, but the dollars are not.
Michael Polark: Yes. Understood. No, that's helpful. And then on the AST services phasing, look, I hear all the destock comments, and it sounds like light at end of tunnel, especially in U.S. devices and bioprocess worst of it annualized in now. I'm looking at AST services in the front half, up 5% year-on-year. What's kind of a good either sequential growth rate or year-on-year growth rate to planned for in the back half?
Mike Tokich: Yes, in the second half, like we expect double-digit -- low double-digit growth rates getting back to more normalized.
Michael Polark: In the AST services line?
Mike Tokich: AST services line, exactly.
Michael Polark: Okay. Helpful. I appreciate that. And then the follow-up topic equipment, healthcare, it's not a metric you report, but we can do our own math, I calculate a book-to-bill, if you will for you, for healthcare equipment. It's -- it was like 1.0 last quarter. It was sub 0.9 this quarter. But -- my question is unlike the fresh order environment, and I want to set it up this way, like you have a big backlog, your -- you have been working real hard to convert the backlog and we're seeing conversion rates tick up, and that's pretty clear. I wonder about like your willingness to refill the backlog as fast? Like is there an element where are you just -- do you need to bid for new business as much at the moment right now as you otherwise would because of the backlog, and that's a dynamic. So I'm curious there and then just broadly on hospital capital spending, if you will, as we move into calendar '24, like similar seeing stresses and strains, no impact? And any thoughts on this would be great. Thanks.
Dan Carestio: Yes. Just a couple -- it's a lot. Just a couple of comments. And I would say our orders remain strong, and I mean there's so much activity out in the field in terms of our portfolio right now. And, yes, one of the positive signs I saw was the significant increase in the replacement business in the last quarter or so versus the prior few periods. And that tells me that: A, our customers have confidence. We can -- and our field also has confidence and we can deliver in a relatively short period of time with normal lead times; and B, they're willing to spend money on a lot of pent-up maintenance CapEx that hospital systems have. I've talked about this before, and that is that although the healthcare providers are not necessarily killing it financially right now, they definitely are on a path to profitability and many of them are in a good cash flow situation where there was a lot more concern a year ago. And the reality of it is as well is that our capital equipment is not -- they're not luxury products. These are capacity enablers. You can't do procedures without lights and tables. You can't do procedures without adequate capacity in the sterile processing department. And that's really what we do. It's not all that sexy, but it's a requirement.
Michael Polark: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Matson: Yes, thanks. I guess I'll start with the Dental business. It was down again. It looks like you're starting to lap some of the declines that you've been seeing. So -- is that, I guess, just what's the outlook there? Is it just really boil down to kind of the economic headwinds or something else, maybe?
Dan Carestio: Yes. I mean short term, we expect it to be about flat this fiscal year. And we would attribute that entirely to the economic downturn and the ability of people to spend cash right now on elective type dental type procedures, and it's just generally impacting the entire industry, and others have spoken on that topic prior to us, I'm sure, in the last couple of weeks. Long-term, we think it's a solid mid-single digit grower. But some of these challenges facing discretionary spending, in particular, the U.S. economy you've got to get sorted out in order for it to get back to those type of numbers.
Michael Matson: Yes. Okay. And then it does look like you're obviously working on the backlog in the Healthcare business. But -- and I wanted to ask about just hospital staffing with regard to the -- getting the equipment installed. I know that, that's been an issue in the past, at least, with some companies. Have you seen that improving? Is that still a constraint on the ability to book the revenue there?
Dan Carestio: No. We've seen that. I mean, there's more coordination today than there used to be maybe in terms of getting stuff received at the docks and getting shipments married up, so we do install. But keep in mind, we've got well over 1,000 techs in the U.S. that do this work for us, that are full-time STERIS employees, that are ready to go to help shepherd the process to get our stuff into the doors and also get it installed properly.
Michael Matson: Okay. Got it. And then I know you may have addressed this in the prepared remarks, if I got on the call a little late. So I just wanted to ask about the gross margin. It did look like it was down a little bit sequentially. And you had a nice improvement, I guess, last quarter sequentially from the fourth quarter, but just any kind of commentary there would be helpful.
Mike Tokich: Yes. Mike, we had mentioned in the prepared remarks that even though margin -- gross margin was down 50 basis points, we did have favorable price. But unfortunately, that was more than offset by lower productivity and continued material and labor inflation. So the productivity, as we are moving stuff through the facility, we are not as efficient as we typically would be. So that negative productivity is hurting us in the short run.
Michael Matson: Yes. Got it.
Julie Winter: AST volumes declined sequentially don't help margin.
Michael Matson: Yes. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.
Jason Bednar: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions here. I want to start on, I think, the topic of the day here with AST, but maybe first on the CapEx side with AST. Just the decision to postpone some of those projects that's influencing the CapEx outlook for the year. I appreciate you wanting to protect free cash flow. But is there a risk at all here that you're foregoing future growth in AST, just been not adding capacity? And should we be thinking about this CapEx spend shifting out of fiscal '24 into '25 and just next year being an above normal year of CapEx spend?
Dan Carestio: Yes. Jason, this is Dan. Thank you for the question. Just to be very clear, we're not delaying these shipments. They were delayed just by the natural building and just current environment of getting things installed and everything else and permitting processes and everything else. So it's -- we have not intentionally slowed those in any way as they've just naturally slowed. And yes, the answer is we would expect those now to be -- would bleed over into next fiscal year from a CapEx perspective. We haven't pulled any projects specifically.
Jason Bednar: Okay. Dan, you're talking about the CapEx spend, not the equipment that you're recognizing as revenue, just to be clear?
Dan Carestio: Correct. Yes. I'm talking about CapEx spend.
Jason Bednar: Okay. Okay. So it was like $65 million of spend that's shifting out of this year into next year?
Dan Carestio: Yes.
Mike Tokich: The bulk of that is AST. It's not 100% in AST, but the bulk of that $65 million is directly related to the AST segment.
Jason Bednar: Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you. And then we've had some questions here on backlog. It sits down $100 million from peak levels. I know we were running well above normal for a long period of time. What do you see as the baseline? Where do you think backlog settles in a normal environment? How much more backlog work down do you think we need to see before we're kind of at that again, that normal level?
Dan Carestio: Yes, we think normal is somewhere around 350, but we're happy to keep it higher if we keep pulling in orders. It was artificially high in the past because of our ability to manufacture and deliver. And as we've sort of solve those issues from a supply chain perspective, it's now really coming down at an accelerated pace.
Mike Tokich: Although I would say that our lead times continue to be longer than we would like them to be.
Jason Bednar: Okay. All right. Thanks. And then last one for me. I don't think I heard it, but if I did, I apologize. Are you able to bifurcate what you're seeing with your U.S. AST services business and contrast that against what you're seeing in Europe? How much the growth rate delta are you seeing across those two markets? It seems like the opportunity for improvement here is more dependent on the European market improving. So just wondering what kind of visibility you have on procedures in that geography recovering and if you're seeing anything or hearing anything from your partners, that would be an encouraging leading indicator?
Dan Carestio: We do look at it. We have a lot of data points, obviously, being in the hospitals and also dealing with -- directly with all of our customers and their insights of what's going on in the market. And there's a lot of public information from NHS and the other public health commissions in Europe. What I would say is it's got to get better. And even if the procedure rates don't improve, at some point, the inventory burn down crosses over and we get back to normal stocking from our customer perspective. And everybody got really bloated on inventory over the last couple of years, and everybody now is trying to bring it down. And we've heard some customers say as much as 40% or 50% and that takes considerable time. Like I said, we crossed over that line in the U.S. And we believe that we'll get to that point in the coming weeks or months, definitely not quarters, I would say, relative to the European destocking as it relates to Medtech. And the other driver we talked about is as we get into the back half of the year, the comps on bioprocessing, the single use disposables become a little easier against us. That's been a real headwind for the first two quarters of the year.
Jason Bednar: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this point in showing no additional questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to the management team for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thank you, everybody, for taking the time to join us. I know you have a busy week. We do look forward to seeing many of you out on the road over the next few weeks of several conferences.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today's conference call and presentation. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-08-02 09:00:00) =====

In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our press release as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making.  With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 11%, driven by volume as well as 290 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 30 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.8%. Favorable price was more than offset by continued material and labor inflation as well as lower productivity.  EBIT margin decreased 50 basis points to 22.4% of revenue compared with the first quarter last year, which reflects a decline in gross margin as well as the anticipated increase in year-over-year incentive compensation, which is recorded in Corporate and Other.  The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.6%. Net income in the quarter was $198.2 million, and adjusted earnings were $2 per diluted share. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $66.6 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $137.9 million.  Debt declined slightly in the first quarter and totaled just over $2.9 billion. Total debt to EBITDA was approximately 2.1x gross leverage. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2024 was $214.5 million as we were able to collect on our strong fourth quarter revenue. Inventory remains elevated as we continue to focus on reducing lead times and meeting customer demand.  With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Daniel Carestio: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for making time to join us to hear more about our first quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. As you heard from Mike, we had a strong start to our new fiscal year exceeding our plans and STERIS' expectations.  Looking at our segments, Healthcare, constant currency organic revenue grew 18% in the quarter. We experienced double-digit growth across capital equipment, consumables and service. This is driven primarily by procedure volumes in the U.S. continuing to rebound as well as price and market share gains. In addition, the improving supply chain environment, coupled with our ability to reduce lead times, led to a very strong quarter of capital equipment shipments.  Hospital capital spending remains robust as evidenced by our healthcare backlog, which totals almost $500 million at the end of the quarter despite the strong shipments. Large projects continue to drive orders representing 40% of first quarter orders. We are increasingly confident in our expectations of a strong year for our Healthcare segment.  Turning to AST. Constant currency organic revenue grew 5%. Our performance in the quarter was impacted by 2 temporary situations, inventory destocking in some categories of med tech and the year-over-year market decline of bioprocessing customer demand. As we said last quarter, FY '24 represents a bit of a reset and we do not anticipate returning to year-over-year growth in bioprocessing in fiscal 2024. As for the med tech inventory destocking, we would not expect that to continue beyond the first half of the year, and we anticipate customer inventories at that time will align with the procedural growth we are all experiencing. As a result, our expectations are for stronger growth in the second half of the year for AST.  Life Sciences revenue declined slightly in the quarter due to the timing of capital shipments which more than offset the growth in service and consumables. Underlying demand for the business remains strong as evidenced by our near-record backlog. Our full year expectations for the Life Sciences segment continue to be mid-single-digit revenue growth despite the lumpy first quarter start.  Our Dental segment first quarter revenue declined 4% on a constant currency organic basis as revenue was limited by customer destocking of inventory, in particular, for infection control products. However, we did see patient volumes improve for the first time post-COVID. We are confident that we will achieve low single-digit revenue growth for the fiscal year in Dental.  All in, we are pleased with the start to the year. Trends continue to shift in a positive direction and our ability to execute and ship products has greatly improved. There are still pockets of uncertainty, whether that be supply chain, procedure volumes or inventory management.  As mentioned in our press release, we believe that the acquisition of the surgical instrumentation assets from Becton, Dickinson will close much earlier than we originally anticipated. As a result, we have updated our outlook for as reported revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We are feeling increasingly optimistic about our constant currency organic performance for the year, yet we are still holding our outlook to 6% to 7% growth. We acknowledge that this is a somewhat conservative approach given our start to the year.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Julie, would you please give the instructions, and we can begin Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Chuck, can you please give the instructions for Q&A and we can get started.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: And a really nice quarter to start the year. Dan, I first wanted to start on the capital equipment. As you kind of think about how you had contemplated the phasing of your guidance. Did you pull forward some capital into the first quarter with excess shipments? And also, how are you thinking about the order environment versus the shipments? I'm assuming it's not one for one and you are thinking about bringing that backlog down in FY '24.
Daniel Carestio: Yes, sure. Thanks. That's correct. What I would say is we overdelivered in terms of what we had anticipated from a manufacturing perspective in Q1. We've been bidding a bit on the supply chain issues over the past year. And so we're trying to do everything possible to manage to our customer demand where they actually need the product now, and we did a better job on delivery. So that pulled forward some revenue that might otherwise been in Q2.  But generally speaking, our ability to produce and deliver is getting better and our lead times are coming down across all of our capital equipment portfolios.  And in terms of the orders intake, yes, there is a point at which you will start to see declining backlog, obviously, as we get back to much more normalized delivery times, with the only caveat being there, some of the large project stuff, Matt, that's got longer lead.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then I have 2 more on the [indiscernible]. And I didn't catch it, but is the phasing 1H-2H still 45-55 from a revenue and EPS perspective? And then secondly, just can you comment a little bit more around the drag from destocking, especially in some categories of med tech? It seems a little bit counterintuitive when you think about the current environment.
Daniel Carestio: Yes. We agree. First off, yes, the phasing remains as originally anticipated. In terms of the destocking that we're seeing in med tech, we really started to see it in Asia Pacific, in particularly around some sterile PPE and some of that was foreseeable given that the national stockpiles have been filled and all that demand sort of went back to normal levels.  What we're a little surprised of is that we're seeing a pullback on our customers' level of inventory.  Now having said that, we shouldn't be surprised because be like everybody else, have too much inventory right now. So -- and as confidence comes back in terms of your ability to produce an ability to get supplies and supply chain solidifies, the natural thing one would expect is to wring out some of that inventory down to levels that are matching demand.  I don't think that process is going to take too long. I think it's been going on for a period of months now. And then I think what you'll see is the inventory demand aligned with the procedure rates, which are clearly higher.  So Matt, I agree with you that the 2 seem in opposite directions in terms of what we're seeing in Healthcare, in particular, our Healthcare Consumables business. And we know that our customers are seeing the same thing. I think they've just got to whittle down some inventory.
Operator: The next question will come from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities.
David Turkaly: Just looking at the healthcare number into the capital one that I'd like to press you a little bit there and say, how are you reducing these lead times? And you called out market share gains. I'm wondering if there's -- are there any new products or there anything you'd highlight in how you put up a number...
Daniel Carestio: Well, I mean, Dave, we're working off a monster backlog that spilled into this fiscal year, and we had some challenges producing. And as we got parts in, our teams were ready and we were able to push up stuff down the line pretty quickly. And we would expect that to continue in terms of our ability to deliver on that backlog. So I wouldn't highlight any single product or any small group of products in terms of new products or anything like that. It's just generally speaking, I think our portfolio is in a really good spot in terms of how it's positioned, not just on a competitive basis on a product by product, but also as a total portfolio in terms of what we can offer.
David Turkaly: And so we think of the market share gains is sort of across the board or is there anything like more specific there that you were kind of calling out in any arena?
Daniel Carestio: Not specifically. I would tend to say we're in a really good position in sterile processing right now in our infection prevention technologies group. But I think we're in a good position as well in other areas of Healthcare. But IPT right now, I think, is really doing -- carrying a lot of the load.
Operator: Your next question will come from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.
Michael Matson: I just had a couple of questions on the Becton, Dickinson deal. Can you maybe talk about the growth that, that business has had in recent years? And then I know you gave us kind of the EBIT or EBIT margin, but what about the gross margin of that business? How does that compare to your kind of corporate gross margin?
Michael Tokich: Yes. I would say that, Mike, on the gross margin side, it's similar. The growth rates would be similar and our long-term view of Healthcare, mid- to high single digits, as we bring that portfolio of products into our Healthcare segment, it's 100% healthcare. So I would say not much different from what we currently have from a margin perspective, both gross margin and a little bit -- it's actually a little bit higher on the EBIT margin standpoint.  Unfortunately, we are going to incur in the short run, higher interest expense, I think as I looked at some of the models that were out there, I don't think everybody appreciated that we are going to use our full revolving credit facility for the $540 million, which is equivalent to about $25 million in interest expense this year. So I think there's a little bit of a slower ramp because of that interest expense. But once we clear some of that expense out, we'll be back to, what I'll call, normalized Healthcare margins.
Michael Matson: Okay. That's helpful. And then I didn't hear you quantify the inflation impact. I know last fiscal year, you were kind of given that every quarter. And then just related to that, you also called out lower productivity in terms of your gross margin. So I don't know if you can comment on either of those things or quantify them.
Michael Tokich: Yes. So we originally anticipated this fiscal year that we would have about $30 million, and we've been using the term excess material labor inflation. We incurred $10 million of that $30 million in the first quarter.
Michael Matson: Okay. And the productivity, lower productivity that you called out, can you talk about that? Or...
Michael Tokich: Yes, we really haven't quantified that, but we are having the same issue that we've had in the past, right? So we are touching our products multiple times as we're waiting on the parts. So that productivity should improve throughout the year, which will help not only our gross margin, but also get more of our EBIT margin back to flattish, which is where our original guidance was for FY '24.
Michael Matson: Okay. Got it. So that's just sort of a byproduct of the supply chain challenge.
Michael Tokich: Correct.
Operator: The next question will come from Steven Etoch with Stephens Inc.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Mac on for Jacob. Just a couple of quick questions for me. Despite a sequential revenue decline, Dental margins increased sequentially. What is the outlook for margins in this segment?
Michael Tokich: I'm sorry, what was the question?
Julie Winter: Dental margin.
Michael Tokich: Dental margins.
Julie Winter: Or should they be long term?
Michael Tokich: Yes. Long term, we said they should rise to near the corporate average. And you are seeing that they are getting much more operationally efficient, which is really helping drive that EBIT margin improvement. There's still a way to go, but we are happy -- more than happy with the progress that they are making within that segment.
Unidentified Analyst: Sorry if you can't hear me, just let me know, I'll repeat the question. But Healthcare operating margins they're the highest it's been in some time, and 2 solid quarters in a row. Are there any onetime bits? Or is this a good run rate going forward?
Michael Tokich: Obviously, volume is the biggest driver at this point in time. We have seen our Healthcare segment operating margins continue to increase. I don't know if we're ready to say it says this is new high and building off of there, but we are very pleased where we are at. And as we continue to put more volume through it as the mix -- especially the mix on the consumables side, if that continues to remain throughout the year. Obviously, there is still potential upside for those margins.
Operator: The next question will come from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Patrick Wood: Amazing. I'll keep it to two, and I'll just ask them both upfront here. I guess the first one, obviously, everyone is talking about the big capital equipment number. I'm just curious like how the conversation with your customers has gone? I appreciate that some of this is working through the backlog and lead times on your end, but presumably, it seems like the customers are in a pretty healthy place if they're willing to be investing one the consume -- on the capital equipment side to that degree.  And then I guess the second one is essentially related to that, which is, in some ways, the more important component of that capital equipment side is the follow-on consumables componentry for the rest of the year. Is it fair to take a look at that strong conversion from the backlog and think about the consumable pull-through and the growth on that side, whether it's for the rest of this year or going into next year?
Daniel Carestio: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. So what I would -- this is Dan, by the way. What I would say is the conversations with the customer, it's interesting because you read the stress that the Healthcare system, in particular, in the U.S., but everywhere else is under financially. I mean, the labor costs have gone up 20% in many places, and they operate on pretty thin margins to start with. So cash is a challenge.  Now having said that, everybody agrees that procedure volumes are returning, recovering and growing and there's pent-up demand. And the STERIS equipment is seen more as a utility than it is a luxury because they can't get the capacity to get instruments through and surgeries process without sterile processing capacity. Without ORs, without the SPD equipment. So we've -- knock on wood, we've remained pretty robust in terms of our order intake. And generally speaking, the outlook is pretty strong for that to continue for some period of time. And yes, as we place those units, and have that real estate in the sterile processing department, the onus is on us to make sure that we get the chemistries and all the other accessories consumables that go along with the steam sterilizer or a washer or an AR, whatever that may be, but the pull-through in that is consistently pretty strong and we have a highly focused dedicated channel in Healthcare organization to focus on that.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Polark with Wolfe.
Michael Polark: I must say first, I counted 8 minutes of prepared remarks, including the disclaimer. So kudos there, that might be an all-time conference call record. My first question maybe a few parts to it is on AST. With the fresh call-out of med tech related destock, internally is your full year revenue expectation for ASP different than it was before?
Daniel Carestio: No. I think what I would say is that it may be weighted more negative in the front half of the year than we anticipated, and we expect to recover some of that in the second half. I mean, Mike, if not for bioprocessing and the destocking that we're seeing right now, I can say confidently we'd be somewhere in the, I don't know, pick a number between 9% and 12% kind of range is what we would have expected. And I think that those 2 issues sort themselves out by year-end. And I think that the health care destocking probably sorts it out sooner than year-end.
Michael Polark: So two follow-ups there on bioprocess and medtech. So on bioprocess, I think this is the third quarter you've called it out year-on-year. So it's definitely been in the run rate sequentially for at least 2 quarters. My question is June quarter versus March quarter, did it deteriorate incrementally? Or is it kind of consistent Q-over-Q in terms of overall order pattern from those customers?
Daniel Carestio: It was flattish to the Q4. The reason why it sticks out a little more is the comp in Q1 and also in Q2 are the two highest, the two toughest comps for us.
Michael Polark: Yes. And then on device customers, I heard the national stockpile call-out. I appreciate that. In kind of interventional medicine, let's say, the neuro and cardio and ortho. Any categories there that you see as kind of especially kind of noteworthy in terms of reducing inventory levels? Or would you call it broad-based ex the PPE stockpiling?
Daniel Carestio: I would say it's broad-based. And I would also say there's some that are still surging and building inventory. We see that in ortho and spine and pain management right now. So -- but that's not a huge amount of the volume flowing through our plants necessarily in the grand scheme of...
Michael Polark: Okay. I hope that was a 3 parter, but I consider that my first topic. My second is more straightforward on BD transaction kind of very prudent entry price, so you're seemingly earning your return on the buy, which is nice to see. Over the mid- to longer term, do you anticipate revenue and/or cost synergies from this portfolio?
Daniel Carestio: I think mostly -- I mean, there are some cost synergies, but they're minimal. I mean, in terms of -- And it more has to do with scale and leverage on channels and things like that. I do think there's some sell-through synergies the way that instruments -- the BD instruments marry up with both our instrument repair business as well as instrument trace and tracking through the sterile processing department.  Everything we do in terms of our washers and sterilizers in our infection prevention technologies group is dealing with instructions for use for all types of different instruments. And I think having the instruments available through STERIS, having the ability to supply, repair and manage the life cycle through washing and sterilization back to the OR is a compelling story from a customer perspective.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler.
Jason Bednar: I wanted to start a little bit with the guidance rationale. You beat consensus by almost $0.15, really strong free cash flow quarter revenue, obviously, as we've all talked about, year was really strong, but you elected not to make any updates to full year guidance. I know we're only one quarter into the fiscal year. It sounds like there's some maybe early year fiscal year conservatism, but can you talk about the pushes and pulls that went into the decision to update or, I guess, in this case, not update core guidance the way you did?
Daniel Carestio: Yes. In short, I would say we did a really nice delivery in terms of our Healthcare business this quarter. And we're -- we look at that business and we're very optimistic in terms of how they're going to perform over this year.  In terms of Life Sciences and AST, there are some things that have to get worked out there. relative to timing of some of these events. We think we understand the market. We think with a high degree of confidence with all the data we have that we know how things are going to play out, but there's no 100% guarantee and there's no 100% accuracy on the crystal ball. So the short answer is we're taking a conservative approach. And if things continue to do great, we'll have a different conversation sometime in the future.
Jason Bednar: Okay. All right. Makes sense. And then I wanted to come back to the Dental business as well here. The core growth has been flat to down for, I think, 4 consecutive quarters now. So the commentary obviously getting easier here going forward. But maybe looking backwards first, are there actions you're taking or you have taken and exiting unprofitable areas or shutting down certain SKUs?  And I really asked just because the performance we've seen so far does seem like it's running a little bit below market. So I'm trying to figure out if there's maybe some self-inflicted pain here that has a positive ROI? Or if you see any other factors that's contributing to the weakness for that segment, again, relative to maybe the market or your peers? And then just as a follow-up here on a two-parter. What contributes to the optimism of getting back -- that business back to low single-digit growth given where it's been trending here?
Daniel Carestio: Yes, a couple of things. I would say I think that we have a little more exposure than some of our peers per se because of the amount of PPE and infection control that is almost half of the business, the STERIS Dental business. And that type of stuff got way overbought and overstocked and it needed to get burned down. And also the comparisons of how much was being used a few years ago versus now, it's a different time and a different world as it relates to that type of stuff.  What I would say is on the instrument side, the Hu-Friedy brand stuff is doing really well in terms of growth, and we would expect that to continue. And we would expect to see innovation from a product perspective and also cost management from a manufacturing and delivery perspective. And the team in the Dental Group has done a really nice job managing the OpEx until we see the market recover as well and making sure that we're not overspending.
Operator: The next question will come from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: I just wanted to talk about like longer-term GI procedures. One of the larger hospital systems was saying that they're realizing pent-up demand, seeing a lot of strong growth for GI and endoscopy. And one of the factors they're starting to see is like a change in guidelines, reducing the age for, I think, colon cancer screening down to 45 and 50 and that's starting to play through. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about your endoscopy business, some of the Cantel doctors and kind of how you're looking at that over the next year or 2?
Daniel Carestio: Yes. What I would say is that the drivers in terms of the 45 age recommendation has helped. I mean it does open up for a lot more screening. The sort of the governor on that for the past, I don't know, up until about a quarter ago or 6 months ago was really Healthcare staffing and the ability to get colonoscopy scheduled.  I know that I personally tried to schedule one in December, and they told me as soon as I could get in was the end of February. So I think a lot of that's been sorted. So it does have an impact, and that is reflected, in particular, in both our capital equipment with all the AERs that we sell, but it also is a major contributor to why we had strong delivery in Healthcare consumables in the first quarter.
Matthew Mishan: And then a follow-up on the Corporate and Other, I believe you mentioned that it was an incentive comp and kind of a reset incentive comp that drive that. Is that type of year-over-year increase from a dollar perspective, something we should be modeling in over the next several quarters as well?
Michael Tokich: Yes, Matt, if you recall, we called out last quarter that we will have a $40 million hole, if you will, that we have to fill from an incentive comp expense year-over-year. So that is a big driver of that increase in corporate expense. A couple of the other drivers in there. We also opened a new distribution center in Indianapolis, Indiana. So that is also at additive cost.  And then one of the other things that we're seeing is our usage of our employee health care benefits is on the rise. So we're also incurring slightly more expense there. So those are the 3 main components that we saw in the first quarter. But for sure, that $40 million we called out last quarter.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Julie Winter for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you out on the road this fall.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-05-11 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the STERIS plc Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on our call this morning will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. And I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth, and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our release, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. Following my review, Dan will comment on the full year of fiscal '23 and talk about our outlook for fiscal '24. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 16% driven by volume as well as 330 basis points of price. As anticipated, gross margin for the quarter decreased 240 basis points, compared with the prior year to 43.1% as pricing and currency were more than offset by unfavourable mix and approximately $15 million in excess material labor inflation. We incurred approximately $90 million in higher material and labor costs during fiscal 2023. We achieved approximately $10 million of cost synergies from the integration of Cantel Medical in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to just over $55 million. We are proud of the work our folks did to integrate Cantel Medical into STERIS, over achieving our projected total cost synergies ahead of schedule. We have substantially completed the integration process and going forward, we will no longer be tracking and reporting cost synergies from Cantel. EBIT margin increased 20 basis points to 23.8% of revenue compared with the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue somewhat offset by the gross margin pressures I mentioned earlier. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23.6%, net income in the quarter was $229.2 million and earnings were $2.30 per diluted share. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 exceeded our plan and totalled $362 million, while depreciation and amortization totalled $553 million. Our capital expenditures spending was higher than anticipated, primarily driven by the timing of investments in our AST segment. Total debt remains just over $3 billion, reflecting borrowings to fund a few small acquisitions during the year and opportunistic share repurchases. We remained active buying back stock in the fourth quarter and in total, repurchase 1.6 million shares in fiscal 2023 for a total spend of $295 million. As we anticipated last week or as announced last week, our board has authorized a new repurchase program for up to $500 million in buybacks. For fiscal 2024 we would anticipate returning to our normal cadence of repurchasing shares only to offset dilution. Total debt to EBITDA at the end of the fiscal year is just under 2.3 times gross leverage. Free cash flow for fiscal 2023 was $410 million. Free cash flow was limited by higher than planned capital spending and pressure on working capital, in particular for inventory and receivables. With that I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Daniel Carestio: Thanks Mike and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our fourth quarter and full year call. I will cover a few of the highlights of the year and then the address our outlook for fiscal 2024. As you heard from Mike we ended the year strong and grew revenue 9% on a constant currency organic basis in fiscal 2023. This is impressive performance in particular given the macro challenges we faced all year. We are cautiously optimistic the supply chain challenges have eased in a meaningful way and surgical procedure rates are improving. Our fourth quarter and full year results are reflective of that. At the business level, our healthcare segment revenue ramped up throughout the year, culminating in 11% constant currency organic growth for the year, with very strong performance in the fourth quarter. Healthcare capital equipment grew 15% for the year on top of double-digit growth last year. The team did a great job working through the whip inventory and shipped $50 million more capital equipment in the fourth quarter than we did in third. Having the components we needed to get those products out to our customers was essential and it was a huge lift by our supply chain and manufacturing teams. While we still have pockets that are challenging, we are feeling much better about the availability and access to components for our capital equipment, heading into fiscal 2024. In addition, our backlog continues to hover around $500 million despite the strong shipment during the quarter. $500 million is a very solid place to start the new fiscal year. Of note, our orders are shifted again towards large projects, which represented 50% of the capital equipment orders in the fourth quarter. Remember that large project orders tend to have longer lead times. Healthcare consumers also finished the year strong as we saw restocking of products as surgical procedures continue to increase sequentially. For the year consumers revenue grew 5% about in line with our long-term expectations, although revenue was a bit lumpier from a quarter-to-quarter perspective than we would normally anticipate. Our healthcare service revenue finished strong, growing 8% for the year with solid growth across all the business aspects. Our AST segment grew 12% on a constant currency organic basis for the year, despite a reduction in demand for single use bioprocessing disposables. As healthcare procedures continue to rebound, the underlying demand for our products from core customers in medtech remain very strong. As mentioned last quarter, about 10% of the AST business is comprised of bioprocessing customers, which slowed for the first time during our third quarter. That trend continued into the fourth quarter where once again we saw a decline in revenue of about $5 million. We believe the trough will come in the first half of our new fiscal year, and while we would expect to return to sequential growth in the second half, we do not expect to return to year-over-year growth until fiscal 2025. Our customers in that space have made significant investments to expand their manufacturing capacity for the long term growth and we have every belief that that growth will return once we work through the short term destocking. Turning to life sciences, constant currency organic revenue grew 5% for the year, with a strong finish in the fourth quarter, despite the reduction in bioprocessing and vaccine demand. As anticipated, the $10 million in capital equipment that we couldn't ship in the third quarter came through in the fourth, contributing to a record quarter of capital shipments. Consumables also finished strong as we worked through supply chain challenges, including more normalized shipping to Asia Pacific, and we were able to make progress towards more normal delivery times. Service grew mid-single digits for the year, with solid performance and equipment maintenance and installation of new capital equipment. Backlog is holding just over $100 million, and that is a great place to start the new fiscal year. Dental was about flat on a constant currency organic basis for the year. Procedure volumes remain at approximately 95% of pre-COVID levels due to the broader economic pressures impacting consumer spending. Based on market data, STERIS is performing better than market and benefiting from pricing and modest share gains. Turning back to the P&L, even with favorable pricing, gross margins were down 180 basis points for the year, as our cost increased at a rate faster than we could recoup. We did a nice job managing SG&A in the year and improved EBIT margin by 10 basis points in the face of the gross margin declines. Unfortunately, part of that was due to lower incentive compensation for our people, which we'll be working hard to get back in fiscal 2024. Interest and taxes were a bit of a headwind to bottom line growth, but we finished fiscal 2023 at $8.20 and adjusted earnings per diluted share, an increase of 4% from fiscal 2022. While that is certainly lower than our standard earnings performance, our five-year CAGR for adjusted EPS is still in impressive 15%. As I said in the beginning of the call, we feel optimistic heading into fiscal 2024. Our strong fourth quarter allowed us to level out our performance between fiscal years more than anticipated. We also saw nice signs of improvement, which began in the third quarter and continued to improve sequentially, leaving us optimistic that we have a few tailwinds in fiscal 2024. In particular, we anticipate continued recovery of healthcare procedures and easing of supply chain issues as well as foreign currency levelling out. For fiscal 2024, total revenue is anticipated to grow 7% to 8%, with about a 100 basis points in positive foreign currency impact. Constant currency organic revenue is expected to grow 6% to 7%. That includes about 200 basis points in favorable pricing. Gross margins are expected to improve modestly as some of the headwinds faced in fiscal 2023 abate. EBIT margins are anticipated to be about flat as we absorb approximately $40 million from incentive compensation year-over-year and cost increases above and beyond normal inflation for material in labor of about $30 million. Interest in taxes will be a bit of a headwind, some of which will be offset by a reduced share count, reflecting the additional purchases made during fiscal 2023. Factoring in all of those moving pieces, our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2024 is $8.55 to $8.75. To assist you in your modelling, we do anticipate that our revenue and earnings will be weighted towards the second year -- the second half of the year. In the first half, we anticipate continued impact from a reduction in bioprocessing demand, resulting in difficult comparisons within AST that will impact our growth and profitability. For both revenue and EPS, we would expect the split to be 45 in the first half and 55 in the second half. As we look at our healthcare capital equipment, backlog remains strong and we believe in fiscal 2024 we will return to a normal cadence of shipments, which generally start lighter in the first quarter and then build throughout the year. Our plan assumes we get back to normal lead times by the end of the fiscal year, and while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I would note that the anticipated cadence of capital equipment revenue, combined with a significantly higher interest expense and tough comparisons in AST with bioprocessing will limit our Q1 earnings growth potential. That said, the tide is turning. We are feeling good about the direction where we are heading and the outlook we have provided for fiscal 2024. As we have said before, our continued long-term goal is to grow revenue mid-to-high single digits and leverage that growth to deliver double-digit growth and earnings. We strive to achieve this while also generating solid free cash flow, continuing to reduce our debt levels and grow our dividend. Before we open for Q&A, I do want to make a few comments on the draft rules issued by the EPA last month. As you all know, over the past few years, we have made significant investments consistent with our practice of continuous improvement within our facilities. Our sustainable EO program and total permanent enclosure investments, position us very well to comply with many of the draft requirements. We believe the EPA understands the weight of this regulation and its impact on the security of the vital US sterile device supply chain, and we are confident there will be a reasonable outcome for the final rules. Behind the scenes, we are partnering with our industry association in terms of our response to the agency. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Julie to open it up for Q&A. Julie?
Julie Winter: Thanks Mike and Dan for your comments. Chad, if you could give the instructions for Q&A, we'll get started.
Operator: [Operator instructions] The first question will come from Matthew, mission from KeyBank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Mishan: Hey, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Hey Dan, could you talk or Mike, can you talk a little bit more about the implied operating margin assumption of kind of flat kind of year-over-year? Outside of incentive comp, is there -- what else -- what are the other major moving pieces there?
Daniel Carestio: Yeah, the next biggest piece is labor costs have gone up across the board as the people we hired last year are more costly. So that's definitely going to hurt us a bit. We also are going to return more to somewhat pre-COVID levels than our spending, especially around travel. And then also FX is actually going to get negative to us in the operating expense, but by the time it gets to the bottom line, it'll be about neutral to us.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then I'm having a little bit of problems modelling flat based upon some of the assumptions below the line. What are -- can you more explicitly call out the assumption for share count and for interest expense in 2024?
Michael Tokich: Yes. Share count will just be -- just over $99 million, interest expense and other will be approximately about a $10 million to $15 million headwind in total. Most of that, as Dan alluded to in his comments, most of that interest expense headwind is going to hit us in the first half. Majority is actually hit us in the first quarter because that's when we started seeing rates significantly rise was in the second quarter and for sure in the second half.
Matthew Mishan: I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Dave Turkaly: Hey, great. Good morning guys and congrats on a strong wrap to the fiscal year. I was wondering maybe if we could get some thoughts, given how this quarter even played out divisionally in terms of how you're getting into the numbers in terms of the growth for fiscal '24. So, I'm sure healthcare's not growing 20%, but even if we're looking at ranking them, sounds like AST may be some tough comps, so maybe it's healthcare, life science, AST, but any color around sort of secular growth rates or what you think for those businesses to start this year?
Daniel Carestio: Yeah, Dave. So if you look at our total company, right, so we would say that on average, most of our businesses other than AST grow mid-to-high single digits. AST obviously, right around double digits, 10% grower this year, that is the case with healthcare potentially outpacing their normal growth. But Life Sciences would be in that same range, and then Dental would be single-digit growth in total.
Dave Turkaly: Got it. And then I wanted to just ask a follow-up on free cash flow. We had a bunch of company's reports. I can jumping back and forth, but I think you guided to $700 million this year, and I think the comp was 409. So I'd just love to get your thoughts, Mike, on what exactly is happening there.
Michael Tokich: Yes. This year, we were under significant pressure from a free cash flow standpoint on both our receivables increased because just the timing of the revenue, a big bulk of our revenue is in Q4. So we were unable to collect. So that will push into FY '24. Our inventory, as we've been talking about all year, has been high. So we've got to take that down. So we're anticipating to take that down in FY '24. And then also in FY '23, capital expenditures were higher than we anticipated originally. So the combination of all three really put pressure on FY '23 free cash flow. As we look into '24, the big change where we're going to get a nice impact is going to be lower inventory our ability to collect those receivables and then just growing net income in total will get us to about $700 million in total free cash flow.
Operator: And the next question will be from Mike Matson from Needham & Company.
Mike Matson: I wanted to ask one on the EPA requirements for ethylene oxide. The comments that you made were, I guess, kind of vague. I guess the way I would interpret them and correct me if this is wrong, is that you are expecting some sort of changes in the final rules. I don't know if you're willing to comment on what areas you think maybe need to be changed. I know [indiscernible] kind of called out the 18-month timing and some of the employee safety requirements in there. And if the final rule ended up looking like the proposed rule, can you comment on whether or not you would meet those standards and whether or not there'd be incremental costs to get there if you don't?
Daniel Carestio: Yes. I think there's still a lot. It's got to get worked out in the final definition of the rule. And my speculation is it probably gets extended in terms of comment period at this point. I would tell you that from a niche perspective, we're really confident where we sit in terms of our ability to meet as written and what could possibly be modified. As it relates to FIFA I think we got a little more gas over that. As we are no one in the industry right now are capable of meeting some of the stated exposure level standards. So I think that's got to get sorted out. And I think it will through the process.
Mike Matson: Okay. And then just on the Dental business, so it was down in '24, most down in most quarters at least. You said 95% of pre-COVID levels. But I would assume if you stayed at the 95% in fiscal '24, then you should be able to get back to flat or even maybe some modest growth there. Is that a reasonable assumption?
Daniel Carestio: That's correct. Yes, that -- assuming that it sustains at that level and some of the modest level of pricing adjustments we've been able to put through, through that business, we believe that we can grow the revenue in the low single digits range.
Mike Matson: Okay. And then just in terms of the share repurchases, so you stepped in to buy back some stock in '23. You said going forward with the new authorization, you're not planning to do anything other than just offset dilution. But I guess, what drove the decision to buy back stock in '23 rather than prepay debt? Was it just opportunistic? I know the stock fell on some of the ethylene oxide concerns and whatnot.
Daniel Carestio: Yes. It was just exactly that, Mike. It was just opportunistic based on where the share price moved down, largely on some of the yield litigation issues and things that the industry are facing. So we saw it as a good opportunity to invest [indiscernible] stock.
Operator: And the next question is from Jacob Johnson from Stephens.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Mac on for Jacob. Just a couple of quick ones for me. And to follow up on the EPA question earlier. Can you comment on some of the initiatives that you already have put in place and do you think these give you a competitive advantage as compared to some of your competitors will have to install those in the future?
Daniel Carestio: Well, what I'll tell you is some of our practices, I mean we've had our employees in what I would categorize as hot zones wearing full PPE, SCBA, self-contain breathing apparatus for over 10 years in our facilities. So I think we're already ahead of most of industry in terms of safeguarding our employees. We've installed on all of our outbound warehouses, abatement systems to scrub any fugitive emissions that's coming off product post aeration process. Those are completely installed operational in the U.S. facilities. A number of other things in terms of just basic engineering design around our facilities where we have complete capture of everything in the chamber rooms as well as sealed drum storage rooms, which are also fully abated in the event of a leak and a number of different engineering controls that we have in place as it relates to the design of the facility. In addition to that, we've been working hard with our customers and also pushing industry very hard to reduce the initial concentrations that are used in cycles and we've been very effective in moving many of the higher concentration cycles that are touching 650, 700 milligrams per liter down closer to 300 milligrams per liter. So it's a much lower input in which much makes handling products, especially post processing, much safer.
Unidentified Analyst: And then also, can you touch a little bit on your capital allocation priorities in terms of the buyback that you previously announced and also M&A for the year?
Michael Tokich: Yes. So our capital allocation priorities have been the same for more than a decade, increased dividends off the top invest ourselves, so continue to spend money from a capital expenditure standpoint, especially growing and investing in our AST expansions. Then M&A and then finally, repurchases typically just to offset dilution. So those four categories have remained. The other one that we -- from time to time, we'll put in there is focus on paying down debt as we're almost two years into the Cantel acquisition that is being a little bit less focused on as our debt levels now are in what we'll call very reasonable ranges at 2.3x levered. And as Mike -- as you heard Mike asked the question earlier about the opportunistic share repurchases, that -- that has not happened very often as a company. But again, we felt that it was advantageous to us to do some of that opportunistically in the third and fourth quarter of this fiscal year.
Operator: And our next question is from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: Two-part on AST. I want to understand the margin trend there kind of pushes and pulls as kind of a steady guide lower throughout the last fiscal. Where does it where does it bottom? And what's the good input for segment margin in fiscal '24? And then related in AST, you've been very clear about destock in bioprocess. I'm wondering what your feel for potentially a similar dynamic is in kind of your core medical device customer base. The world is kind of emerging from COVID procedures seem to be back. A lot of the interventional medical device companies are holding way more inventory than they used to. Is there any kind of risk a little bit of a destock cycle there for you or not, how are you thinking about that in fiscal '24?
Daniel Carestio: Yes. I'll address the latter first in terms of recovery in med tech. I don't think so. Really, what we're seeing in terms of our med tech customers is they're really rebuilding the inventories that they have and they're still, in many cases, hand to mouth in terms of being able to deliver for hospitals right now. So it's not as if they're flushed with inventory across the system. And so I would assume we'll see some continuing build of inventory of anticipation of surgeries continuing at the rates they're at as well as there's a lot of pent-up demand that's got to be worked off over the next coming months or a year or so. So I don't think there's a lot of risk in terms of any type of inventory pullback from a med tech perspective. I think it's pretty robust. In terms of the other question around the AST margins, I mean, the short answer is there were inflationary pressures, in particular, on energy and labor. And the labor is baked in is what I would say, and we can leverage that over scale as we get volume coming through. It tends to help a bit. Energy, my crystal ball doesn't work when it comes to electricity pricing in Europe anymore. So it is what it is. It's high right now. It was high this winter. In theory, it should come down some over the coming months or a year, but your guess is as good in mind on that.
Michael Polark: Helpful. And then maybe just a request for a feel for hospital spending patterns on capital equipment kind of made comments about good mix of new large projects in your new orders. What's your crystal ball say about how new spend patterns show in fiscal '24?
Daniel Carestio: It's interesting, and we're pleasantly surprised every month when we see the orders coming in strongly, very strong as we did in Q4. And our backlog is sitting at $500 million in Healthcare, which is either at or near all-time record highs basically. You got to think of it this way. Most of what we sell in terms of capital is necessary to facilitate volume of procedures and recovery of volume of procedures through the hospital. I mean the sterile processing department equipment we sell in terms of washers and sterilizers and sinks and everything like that. You got to think of it more like a utility, and it's not a nice to have, it's something you need to have in order to accomplish the growth for patients in terms of procedure volumes. So we've been somewhat immune to the financial lows of the Healthcare sector, I would say, in terms of hospital spending. And I believe that will continue in terms of the long term. I think over time -- and I don't know if that's six months or a year from now, you're probably going to see some de-escalation in terms of just infrastructure build-out that we're seeing right now. And one would also think that as things tighten a bit in terms of capital. It generally has the impact of slowing down the replacement business a bit, which we tend to pick up then on the service side. But as of right now, we seem to be doing pretty well in terms of order intake.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler.
Jason Bednar: A bit of a related follow-up there on Polark's question asking on segment margin, but I'll focus on the place for margins actually in the opposite direction. Healthcare margins improved sequentially now, I think, five quarters in a row. Can you talk about your comfort level on the year-end or full year margin levels in that segment as we look forward to fiscal '24, again, in the context of your overall guide as well?
Michael Tokich: Yes, we should continue to do fairly well and increased margins in Healthcare. We anticipate that we will continue to get price within Healthcare. We also anticipate that some of the pressures surrounding inflation, material and labor cost ease. We should also be able to get some productivity increases in our Healthcare business just because we had to touch the products so many times last year with parts availability that should help us improve. So I would anticipate that the margin is Healthcare gets slightly better. EBIT margins in Healthcare get slightly better in FY '24 for those reasons.
Jason Bednar: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe another follow-up but bigger picture on Dental. You've had that asset now for a couple of years. I know you've gotten this question in the past, but maybe just to revisit it. Can you update us on your thoughts regarding that category, mostly your commitment to that end market. On one hand, it's a good category for roll-ups. It's fragmented. There are a lot of private companies out there that aren't runs in a super-efficient way. So that's an opportunity, but it's also a drag on growth in margins for the overall franchise. And it's tough to forecast, I think, strong mid-single-digit growth for that market even longer term. So maybe you disagree there. But again, just love your updated view on just as we head into year three steroids commitment and participating in that metal market.
Daniel Carestio: Yes, we remain committed. We need to see it through in terms of recovery. We didn't anticipate last year the sliding into an economic recession that was going fork this progress made in terms of procedure recovery that we're seeing Dental and now it's become an economic issue. So I think we need to see that play out over this fiscal year and see how the business performs. There's still -- I would just reiterate, there's still a lot of opportunity for operational improvement, deliver improvement in the business, and that's something that STERIS as a long history as good operators of being able to really drive improvements with the business. It would be nice to see the volume resume. It makes -- it makes all those good things that we're doing much more visible in terms of bottom line performance when the volume comes back.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: I was just looking at a lot of great data disclosed in terms of the reporting. I could explain sequentially the Healthcare consumables line, notable step-up there, clearly levered procedure and throughput. Healthcare services line stepped up notably sequentially, and I struggle a little bit kind of tying that to an end market development. So kind of what happened there Q-over-Q, it was a double-digit increase?
Michael Tokich: Yes, Mike, a big portion of that was we actually had parts availability, so we're actually able to get parts into our customers' hands and fix some of their products. So that is a main driver of that plus we shipped some capital equipment. Obviously, in third quarter, we were able to install that in the fourth quarter, so we generated revenue there. Those are the two main drivers of that business for Q4 improvement.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us, and we look forward to seeing many of you on the Ross summer.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-02-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the STERIS plc Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on our call today will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth, and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our release, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 7%, driven by volume, as well as 300 basis points of price. As anticipated, the divestiture of the Renal Care business impacted our revenue comparisons to the prior year by about $47 million, which is detailed in the press release tables. This is the last quarter of a year-over-year impact for the Renal Care business as we divested it in January of last year. The integration of Cantel Medical continues to go well. We achieved approximately $10 million of cost synergies in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to about $45 million. We are well on track to achieve our stated goal of approximately $50 million in fiscal year 2023. As anticipated, gross margin for the quarter decreased 200 basis points, compared with the prior year, to 43.1%, as pricing, currency, and the favorable impact from the divestiture of Renal Care were more than offset by lower productivity, unfavorable mix, and higher material labor costs. Sequentially, the impact of material labor costs have improved and totaled about $15 million in the quarter, compared to the prior year. This puts us at about $75 million year-to-date, with our outlook of $90 million for the year remaining unchanged. EBIT margin declined 10 basis points to 23.9% of revenue, compared with the third quarter last year, which reflects the gross margin pressures mentioned earlier, which were partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.4% higher than the prior year, due primarily to geographic mix and favorable discrete items, which occurred in last year's third quarter. Net income in the quarter was $202.4 million and earnings were $2.02 per diluted share, reflecting the lower anticipated value. Capital expenditures for the first nine months totaled $290.5 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $410.7 million. Year-to-date, our capital expenditure spending has been higher than anticipated, primarily due to timing of our investments within the AST segment. We still expect our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million. Total debt increased slightly in the third quarter to just over $3 billion, reflecting borrowings to fund a few small acquisitions and share repurchases. Total debt to EBITDA is slightly over 2.3 times gross leverage. Free cash flow in the first nine months of the year was $263 million. Free cash flow was limited by higher-than-planned capital spending, mainly due to timing, and higher levels of inventory. With continued pressure on working capital, in particular, inventory and, now, accounts receivables, we now anticipate the free cash flow for the full year will be about $500 million or a reduction of about $100 million, based on our last guidance. With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Daniel Carestio: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter call. I will cover a few highlights from the quarter and then address our revised outlook for the fiscal year. Starting with Healthcare, the segment grew 10% on a constant currency organic basis in the quarter. This was driven by high-teens growth in capital equipment. In particular, improved shipments in our IPT business were driven by operational and supply chain improvements in core washing and steam products. In addition, we saw double-digit revenue growth in our surgical products. Our main supply chain issue continues to be with electronic components. We are working hard to resolve these issues. And as we have discussed, we are working with existing and new suppliers where possible to ensure the availability of parts in order to meet customer demand. The Healthcare services business delivered double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth, driven by increased demand and improved pricing. We also saw sequential improvement in consumables. Consumables constant currency organic revenue grew low-single digits, compared with third quarter of last year. Supporting that growth, U.S. procedure volumes improved in the quarter, with recovery outside of the U.S. still lagging. The underlying dynamics of our Healthcare segment remains very favorable. Hospital capital spending remains stable, as evidenced by our Healthcare backlog, which totaled over $500 million at the end of the quarter. Orders for the quarter remained at approximately a 60-40 split for replacement and large projects, and we are not seeing any order cancellations at this time. Although we still have some delays, our capital shipments have improved dramatically from prior quarters. Approximately $30 million in capital equipment shipments were delayed into the fourth quarter. Overall, our third quarter Healthcare performance showed nice improvement. Opportunities remain from a supply chain perspective, which we anticipate will take some time to fully work through. Our expectations for the fourth quarter reflect a conservative outlook on how quickly we can recover from these challenges and difficult comparisons in AST and Life Sciences. Our AST segment grew 7% on a constant currency organic basis despite a reduction in demand for bioprocessing disposables and delayed shipments from Mevex, our capital equipment business. On the bioprocessing side, our second quarter this year was a peak level for biopharma within AST. We are hearing from customers that they are resetting their expectations due to reduction in vaccine production. Importantly, we are not seeing declines in total revenue at this time, but rather a flattening of growth. Positively, we anticipate that our core medical device customers will benefit from improvement in procedures, which we expect will help AST continue to perform at historic levels. Regarding Mevex, a large E-Beam capital equipment order of approximately $10 million was delayed into Q4, as our customer was not ready to receive the unit. Turning to Life Sciences, constant currency organic revenue was down about 1% for the quarter, with declines in capital equipment and consumables, somewhat offset by growth in service. The same factors impacting the bioprocessing demand in AST are also impacting our Life Sciences consumables volume. In addition, we have difficult comparison with strong consumables growth in the third quarter of last year. That said, we do anticipate that this is a matter of timing as cell and gene therapies continue to increase in demand, which should help offset the reduction in vaccine production. We remain confident in the long-term growth drivers within the customer base for both AST and the Life Sciences segments. In addition, Life Sciences had an unanticipated shipping challenge out of Europe that limited capital equipment growth in the quarter by about $10 million. Positively, backlog remains at near historic levels at over $100 million. Dental increased 1% on a constant currency organic revenue basis in the quarter. Procedure volumes remain at approximately 95% of pre-COVID levels due to the broader economic pressures impacting consumer spending. Based on market data, STERIS is performing better than market and benefiting from pricing and modest share gains. As you heard from Mike, gross margins remained under pressure as anticipated. Despite the impact of lower gross margins and increased pressure from foreign currency, we hit -- we held EBIT margins about flat in the quarter, as SG&A was lower than planned, largely driven by lower incentive compensation. With added pressure on interest rates and taxes, our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter came in at $2.02. As a result of our performance to date and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are revising our full year guidance. As reported revenue is now anticipated to grow 6%, compared with prior expectations of 8% growth. Based on foreign currency forward rates through March 31, 2023, currency is now anticipated to negatively impact revenue by approximately $110 million this fiscal year, a decline from expectations of approximately $150 million. Constant currency organic revenue is now anticipated to grow approximately 7%, compared with prior expectations of 10%. With one quarter left, this revision in outlook implies the challenges, which limit our performance in the third quarter do continue. Reflecting on the lower revenue, adjusted earnings per diluted share are now anticipated to be in the range of $8.00 to $8.10. Our long-term expectations for the business remain unchanged. We continue to be very strongly confident and believe that STERIS is capable in generating mid-to-high single digit constant currency organic revenue growth and double-digit earnings growth into the future. With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thanks, Dan and Mike, for your comments. Jamie, if you'll give the instructions, we can open up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Turkaly: Great. Thanks. Hi, I just wanted to confirm something here, Dan. So, you called out $30 million in delayed capital shipment in Healthcare, I think, and then $10 million from AST and then $10 million, I think, from Life Sciences. So, if I look at those and add them up and get to $50 million, I mean that seems to be about -- the mix might have been different, but about what you were shy of the Street. Is that -- are we thinking about that correctly?
Daniel Carestio: Yes, sure, Dave. That's correct.
Michael Tokich: Dave, I would also add in there. The reduction in bioprocessing was another $10 million roughly, and that was split about evenly between AST and Life Sciences, just so that we're all on the same page.
Dave Turkaly: No, I appreciate that. And I guess, one for Dan too. I mean, obviously, the good news is this is not a common occurrence with you guys. But if we look at this, the -- I think it even said growth in bioprocessing customers, but you explained that the vaccine was the main driver. But how does that sort of -- I guess, what is the lead time there? How does it sort of maybe sneak up -- probably not the right word, but on use of that, we didn't know this last quarter and now, we do?
Daniel Carestio: Yes. So, let me give you a little background. So, our customers are typically, at least in AST, where we took the biggest hit, are typically the manufacturers of single-use technologies that are sterile technologies that are used in aseptic manufacturing for vaccines and biopharmaceuticals. What we saw -- what we have seen for the last couple years is high double-digit growth on a year-over-year in that sector within AST. It's been one of our larger growers and depending on the quarter, it's contributed anywhere from 1.5% to 2.5% growth on top of the normal growth that we've seen in AST. That peaked in Q2, which would be at the end of the summer, early fall, which would be logical going into high vaccine production sort of season. Our customers had built a lot of inventory. And with the slowdown and either vaccine reluctancy or just vaccine production in general, they were stranded with a lot of inventory. And consequently, our volumes in Q3 went down significantly. So, we started to see it in the beginning of Q3. At that point, there is nothing we could do to adjust, and we think this is something that will work its way through as the inventories burn down. And the underlying supporting growth for single-use technologies in bioprocessing remains. It's -- once we work through the tough comparison of the vaccine spike that was anticipated.
Dave Turkaly: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan: Hi, good morning, Dan, Mike, Julie. I just want to take a step back, Dan. Can you just -- could you just kind of frame for us what you think the normalized growth profile for STERIS is over the next several years? I imagine you really don't think it's a 10% or 11% grower, and where you're coming in this year is probably more in line with, what kind of longer term, how you look at the business?
Daniel Carestio: Yes. I mean, our stated objective is to grow high-single digits on the topline and low-double digits on the bottom line. And we believe with a high degree of confidence that's something we can continue to do even in the current market conditions over the long haul.
Matthew Mishan: And then as you think about going out to next year versus that high-single digits, what looks, I guess, better or worse as you think about next year?
Daniel Carestio: Matt, we've got to get through Q4 at this point. And so, we are not doing any guidance for next fiscal year. A few comments I would say that are -- this is preliminary, but encouraging is -- and you've heard some of our other medtech peers mention that they're optimistic about procedural recovery in the second half of the calendar year. We believe things started in Q3 to recover back to pre-COVID levels in Healthcare, particularly in the U.S.; it's still lagging pretty significantly outside of the U.S. But assuming that holds and improves in the second half of the calendar year, since we're largely a procedure-driven company, that would be beneficial to us.
Michael Tokich: And Matt, I would just also add. Obviously, our backlog remains -- at least at Healthcare at record levels and within Life Sciences, near-record levels. And you have seen that we are getting through some of the supply chain constraints. We did ship more sequentially. That $30 million of capital deferral in Healthcare was $60 million last quarter. I mean, we are seeing progression there. So, that does give us, as we look out further, more confidence for next year.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And I guess, just the last one, just on the order environment. I mean, your backlog did go up sequentially. It typically does on a seasonal basis. But as you're shipping out more from supply chain improving, how should we think about the order environment and your ability to replenish those?
Daniel Carestio: It's remained very strong at this point, which I know is a bit in the face of everything you read about the financial performance of a lot of the hospital systems these days. But they seem to be still willing to significantly invest in the future capacity requirements. For procedures -- and keep in mind, largely, everything that we sell in terms of capital into hospital systems, it's almost like infrastructure. In order for them to perform at a higher rate of sort of volume, they've got to have more sterilizers, they've got to have more washers, they have to have more OR tables and lights. So, I think our equipment is not -- it's not a luxury, it's a utility in many respects.
Matthew Mishan: I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Jacob Johnson: Hi, thanks. Good morning. A couple on the bioprocessing market. First, Mike, if I heard you correctly, $10 million headwind in 3Q. Is that the right way to think about 4Q? And then as I kind of listened to what your customers are talking about, they're seeing some near-term headwinds from COVID, but -- and inventories, but they're kind of looking to the back half of this calendar year, where things will normalize again. Is that maybe the right way to think about it for you all, or is there some kind of lag in terms of what they're seeing versus when the demand comes to you all?
Daniel Carestio: I think what you're going to see as it relates to bioprocessing is you're going to see pretty tough comps leading up to Q2 of this past year, the year that we're currently in. So, I think as we burn those down and get back to what is the normalized growth rate for bioprocessing, which is still in the mid-to-higher double digits, but it's going to take some time to burn through the inventory and to burn through what was a spike in vaccine production demands.
Jacob Johnson: Okay. Thanks for that, Dan. And then my follow-up, which you may have answered, but I'll check is, just on the AST side of things, did the slowdown due to COVID impact any of your kind of capital allocation plans, especially as I think about X-ray capacity?
Daniel Carestio: No. I mean, it's -- we're obviously looking at our capital spending and adjusting the timing of when we build and add this -- the infrastructure into our capacity. The market and just the inconvenience of supply chains and construction has helped us defer capital a bit, just because it's been a challenging time to build anything. But no, our plans remain largely unchanged, maybe different prioritizations of what comes online first. But other than that, the projects are still in play and we're very confident about those.
Jacob Johnson: Got it. I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Mike Matson: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to ask one about the backlog in Healthcare. I understand you don't want to give guidance for '24 yet, but just not -- without specifying a time frame, I guess, it just seems like you kind of expected some above-normal growth this year and -- given the backlog and that didn't happen mainly because of the supply chain, I guess. But is there still potential for you to -- as you catch up on sort of that backlog, to see above-normal growth in the Healthcare business at some point?
Daniel Carestio: I mean, what I would -- yes, at some point, and we're not defining that point at this time. We expect sequential improvement in our capital shipments as we look to the quarter that we're in currently. And as we look into next fiscal year, we continue to believe things are improving and that would lead one to believe that we will deliver a disproportionate amount of capital in that backlog in the first half of the year. But we have not modeled that out and we have not done our planning yet on that.
Mike Matson: No, I understand. And then just as far as pricing I mean, good to see the 300 basis points. Again, without asking for a specific number for '24, but just I'm wondering about the sustainability of kind of that higher level of price increases. Is that -- with your contracting and everything that's in place, I mean, is that something that's got some legs to it that could continue for a while, or is it more like a one-year bump and then kind of goes back to, like, normal levels?
Daniel Carestio: I think that largely is determined by what happens or continues to happen with inflationary pressures. To the extent that we need to push through pricing and it makes sense to do so in order to protect our margins and still remain competitive in the marketplace, that's something that we'll do and we have always done consistently at STERIS.
Mike Matson: Okay, got it. And then my final question, just on the AST business. Just given what's happened with your primary competitor there with all the EO litigation and everything, I wanted to see if you've seen any -- I'm not asking about the litigation specifically, but just have you seen any kind of movement away from them or any impact on your business because of what's happened with them?
Daniel Carestio: No, I wouldn't say so. I mean, the current situation in the industry is the capacity is pretty tight, especially as it relates to ethylene oxide here in the U.S. So, we have strong partners across medtech, and we're always striving to take a little more share of wallet wherever we can do that.
Mike Matson: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.
Jason Bednar: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. First one, I'll follow up on Matt Mishan's question earlier, but maybe take a different stab at this. I wanted to come back to some questions around guidance. A lot of things that are understandably outside your control, we've seen that here this year. But guidance is in your control, and this is the second time in three quarters where we've seen guidance lowered. So, since we're sitting just a few months away from fiscal '24 guidance, I guess, what learnings can you say that you've taken from this year that can help inform how you set your outlook for fiscal '24? And then I know a few others have asked, but I guess, just any early puts and takes we should be considering as we work through our models for next year, particularly on the equipment side?
Daniel Carestio: Yes, Jason, I'll make one comment, and then I'll let Mike add a few comments as well. I think we came into the year when we did our planning in our guidance with an awfully large backlog. And just -- and we're under the impression, because we had navigated COVID incredibly well at that point relative to supply chain and we really got -- we got tripped up pretty bad in Q1. And it exposed some vulnerabilities in our supply chains across our manufacturing network. What I can tell you is we're a lot more resilient now and we have a much better eye and a much better strategic focus on managing those supply chains and having much more resiliency, and I believe that will carry forward into next year. Now, having said that, just because you roll into the year with a large backlog, I think we need to be a little more cautiously optimistic and a little more metered in our expectations of how quickly that will shift.
Michael Tokich: Yes. I think surgical procedure volume was the other thing that we anticipated was going to be much higher this year. And obviously, everybody knows how that is playing out, although from a favorability standpoint, we have seen some improvement in Q3 in the U.S. in particular. But again, there is just so many moving pieces here. And to Dan's point, I think conservatism at the end of the day is the norm for us, and we have put out a outlook for the fourth quarter that we believe is conservative in nature, based upon the facts that we continue to work with throughout the year.
Jason Bednar: All right. Very helpful, and that's good to hear. Okay. Then maybe one on free cash flow. I mean, we saw the pretty sizable reduction. I know we're talking, I think, some round numbers here, $500 million versus $600 million. But that is a much bigger drop than what's implied just from the EPS cut. I think, Mike, you mentioned some comments there around inventory running higher, receivable collections running lower. Maybe could you bucket those two? And does that reverse as we start thinking towards free cash flow then for next year, does working capital work lower?
Michael Tokich: Yes. I would say that if we go back to the beginning of the year, we anticipated about $675 million in free cash flow. And obviously, we're down to $500 million. And I would bucket though, that inventory and receivables two-thirds, one-third. Inventory is remaining elevated. Obviously, as we have not been able to ship at the rates we anticipated, we are carrying more inventory, as we've talked many times the last couple of quarters. We continue to fill our manufacturing slots. So we're building, building, building, waiting for that golden screw. But that golden screw doesn't come, that product remains in inventory until we ship it. So, inventory has continued to be elevated. And then on the receivables side, it's not our inability to collect. It's just the timing of collections. We have about just under a 60-day DSO that we have collection. So, originally, we anticipated shipping earlier or more product in the third quarter. That has shifted to the fourth quarter, which pushes collections into the first quarter. So, free cash flow isn't lost. It's just more of a timing issue.
Jason Bednar: Okay. All right. Makes sense. I'll hop back in queue. Thanks so much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Polark: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I want to follow up on bioprocess and AST and trying to put together some math, Dan, that you mentioned earlier in the Q&A. So, at one point, not long ago, it was contributing 1.5 points to 2 points of growth to the segment. I also heard that it's been growing high-double digits, which I would interpret as 15% to 20%. So, if I put those two data points together, bioprocess as a portion of total and AST is 10%. Is that a ballpark? The question is --
Daniel Carestio: Yes, ballpark. Maybe slightly less, but you're in the range.
Michael Polark: Okay. The follow-up also AST. The Mevex $10 million slippage, I know this is a recent acquisition. It's been lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I had $10 million of revenue from this in the year-ago quarter. And now, you're calling -- while you were annualizing it in the numbers and now you're calling out a $10 million slippage out of this quarter, which I would interpret as Mevex was at or near zero in the quarter. So, the question is, what is the revenue headwind from this equipment line in AST year-on-year?
Michael Tokich: Yes. Your math is about right. And in total, we're somewhere between $25 million and $30 million for the full year for Mevex. But yes, you're exactly right, Mike. It was near zero. So, that full $10 million is flipped from one quarter, third quarter to the fourth quarter. And again, it's the timing. It is lumpy, unfortunately. I know that AST has in the past been much more predictable for us, but Mevex has hurt us twice now with shipping issues. But if you add the Mevex shipping issues, you take the biopharma processing, you're back to somewhere in the low-teens growth for AST. So, the trajectory hasn't changed dramatically, but it's the timing that is the concern, I think, from everybody's standpoint.
Daniel Carestio: Yes. Just to add to that, Mike, those systems for Mevex can be anywhere from $5 million or $6 million to $12 million, and they're large build systems with lots of conveyance and complicated electronics and control systems. And we rely on our customers to have the infrastructure in place before we can come install. And sometimes there's change in scope and sometimes, there's just delays in construction. So, it's as much as we try to stay on top of it and help project manage. Ultimately, it's in the hands of our customer as to when we can deliver.
Michael Polark: I have two for me. I would hop back in queue and ask a few more, but I guess -- maybe I'll do that and come back in. So, thank you.
Michael Tokich: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Tokich: You there, Matt?
Matthew Mishan: Yes, sorry about that. I guess, we're going to be doing some follow-ups on this call. Just first on the consumables, the low-single digit growth you saw, kind of -- it's been lagging or like flat to low-single digit, maybe even a little bit of declining in a couple of quarters ago. Kind of what's your sense of hospital inventory of your consumables? Is it pure volumes, or has there been some destocking that's going on as well?
Daniel Carestio: I think it's purely procedural volume-driven. They don't hold a lot of this, because it's heavy, it's bulky. It takes up a lot of space. So, it's not something that would carry a lot of excess inventory of.
Matthew Mishan: And is it across the board from core STERIS, Cantel, Key Surgical, or is there a little bit of mix change in pieces of the business that may be lagging versus others?
Daniel Carestio: You can get into a really complex stratification of this. But in the end, it's not really any one particular piece that's driving it one way or another. So, I wouldn't say it's a mix issue. It's truly procedure-driven, certain procedures in terms of where we have a little more exposure with our endoscopy products, obviously, to endoscopy procedure rates. But generally speaking, it's all procedurally-driven demand.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then --
Julie Winter: Matt, you guys know we are heavy U.S., right, compared to a lot of other healthcare companies. We're 80% U.S. in what we do. So, the trends here have the biggest impact on our performance.
Matthew Mishan: And then back to AST, I mean, does this open some capacity for AST with some slower growth in bioprocessing? I guess -- and my sense would be you could fill that fairly quickly if -- because there's like the shortage through the industry.
Daniel Carestio: Yes. Well, keep in mind, all single-use technologies for bioprocessing only run in radiation, so not ethylene oxide, where there's real significant shortage. And really, the phenomena is, if we're running with a lot of product backlog, especially as we come up to the holiday seasons, in a typical year in AST, we would starve out our plants. So, we'd shut down a day or two and you either do it the Christmas week or you end up starving out, because it takes customers a longer time to start up production, because they've shut down factories before you see their supply chain start to flow in early January. In the case of the last couple of years, we've been sitting on so much backlog demand in bioprocessing that we ran at a number of our plants straight through the holidays, 24/7, 365. So, not doing that in this year's case; it's basically straight drop-through because of the high fixed cost model at AST.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then, Mike, if I'm looking at the balance sheet, right, it looks like the debt -- you've generated cash flow through the course of this year, even with the working capital build. Why -- I guess, why has the debt balance gone up? And why not pay some of that down to lower interest expense?
Michael Tokich: Yes. So, the debt balance went up primarily for two reasons. One, we did some minor acquisitions, some tuck-ins that we paid cash for during the quarter. And then we continued to fulfill our dilution offset for share repurchases. And then we also were opportunistic during the quarter on the share repurchase side just due to the overhang that we were facing with the EO situation. So, in total, we spent about $88 million in the quarter on share repurchases and then another $50 million to $75 million of cost for acquisitions. So, those are the two main drivers that changed our profile of debt. We still are within the leverage ratio that we are very comfortable in. We're just over 2.3 times. We did pay off during the quarter a private placement note that was due, which was about $91 million. So, we actually just borrowed -- it was fixed versus floating. So, our interest rate ticked up just a tiny bit. Our average interest rate is just under 4%, as we sit here today.
Matthew Mishan: And then how much is left on your authorization for share repurchase?
Michael Tokich: About $160 million remains under the current authorization.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Michael Tokich: You're welcome, Matt.
Operator: And our next question is also a follow-up from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your follow-up.
Michael Polark: Hi, thank you. Just two. In Healthcare capital, given the supply chain strains, are you fully competing for new orders, or has the supply chain challenges impacted your kind of -- your ability to bid for new business?
Daniel Carestio: We're still fully competing. And you got to think of it this way. These are generally -- a significant portion of our business is long-term projects. And then the other portion is replacement, and that's largely replacement of equipment that we already have placed in the marketplace. So, if we have a longer term in terms of delivery for replacement unit, we tend to be able to work with the customer and manage that through our service arrangements and service contracts until we can replace that with a new system.
Michael Polark: Makes sense. And the last one. The few small acquisitions in the quarter, anything to flag there? In what business segments and any revenue that we -- even if minor, any revenue that we should consider for our bridge work over the next year or so? Thank you.
Julie Winter: We called those out in the Q last night, Mike, some Healthcare and AST really small deals in some cases, buying out a former distributor, for example, where there's really no change in revenue to the company, but we're choosing to go direct to markets opportunistically.
Michael Polark: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. If anyone would still like to chat, please let me know, and I'll be happy to do my best to accommodate you. Take care.

===== 2023 Q2  (2022-11-10 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the STERIS plc Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded.  At this time, I’d like to turn the conference call over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter : Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. And I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments.  This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the express written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in our securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in yesterday's release, also including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intended providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich : Thank you, Julie, and good morning. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 7%, driven by volume as well as 290 basis points of price. As anticipated, the divestiture of the renal care business impacted our comparisons to the prior year by about $45 million, as detailed in the press release tables. Our year-over-year growth rates will be impacted by this divestiture for one more quarter. The integration of Cantel Medical continues to go well. We achieved approximately $15 million of cost synergies in the second quarter, bringing our first half total to about $35 million. We are on track to achieve our stated goal of approximately $50 million in fiscal year 2023. As anticipated, gross margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points compared with the prior year to 44.8% as pricing, currency and the favorable impact from the divestiture of Renal Care were more than offset by lower productivity and higher material and labor costs. Material, labor costs continue to be a headwind and totaled about $30 million in the quarter. Despite the decline in gross margin, EBIT increased 50 basis points to 23.8% of revenue compared with the second quarter of last year, which reflects the benefit of realized cost synergies from the Cantel integration, currency impact and lower-than-anticipated SG&A expenses driven by disciplined cost management and reduced incentive compensation. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8%. Net income in the quarter increased to $200 million and earnings were $1.99 per diluted share. You will notice that we reported a loss on a GAAP basis in the quarter. At the time of the Cantel acquisition, we determined the fair value of the Dental segment based on projected cash flows discounted at rates reflecting market costs of capital and market EBITDA multiples. Macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, inflationary pressures on material labor costs and uncertainty regarding the impact of such economic strains may have on patient and customer behavior in the short term triggered an interim assessment of goodwill in the quarter. Revised cash flow projections and a current market weighted average cost of capital resulted in an estimated fair value of the Dental segment below its carrying value. Therefore, we recorded a $490. 6 million noncash impairment charge related to the goodwill associated with the Dental segment. Our long-term outlook for the Dental segment is unchanged. And we continue to see significant growth opportunities in the dental space for STERIS. Capital expenditures in the first half of the fiscal year totaled $198.7 million while depreciation and amortization totaled $272. 7 million. Year-to-date, our capital expenditures have been higher than anticipated, primarily driven by the timing of investments in the AST segment. We still expect our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was $138.2 million. Free cash flow was limited by higher-than-planned capital spending, mainly due to timing and higher-than-planned levels of inventory. We do not anticipate the same level of spend in the second half of the fiscal year for either which will contribute to a significant step up in free cash flow. All in, we now anticipate that free cash flow for the full year will be about $600 million or a reduction of $75 million from our original guidance. I will now turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Daniel Carestio : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us to hear more about our second quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. We continue to see strong demand for our products and services. And as you've heard from Mike, we had a solid quarter despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. I will review the highlights of the quarter and then shift my commentary to our outlook. Total company constant currency organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter. Once again, foreign currency was more impactful than previously planned on our as-reported revenue, but we are pleased with our operational performance. From a segment perspective, Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 7% in the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, by August, we had an improved visibility on supply chain challenges and that we anticipated that we would start to see better component deliveries in the quarter. We received several key components, and we're able to step up our shipments in September. We continue to expect to see significant levels of capital shipments in the second half based on our backlog, the inventory of key components that we have or will continue to receive. Reflecting that scenario, capital equipment and service growth remained solid in the quarter as we continue to see good demand from our customers. Consumables were about flat on a constant currency organic basis. Our consumable growth is limited due to a lack of procedure growth on a year-over-year basis. As we have said before, we do not expect a significant pickup in procedures in the coming months, but we are optimistic we will get back to 100% pre-pandemic levels over time. Hospital capital spending remains robust as evidenced by our Healthcare backlog, which totaled over $500 million at the end of the quarter. Orders for the quarter were approximately 60% for replacement products and 40% for large projects. Despite the uptick in shipments at the end of the quarter, we believe approximately $60 million in capital equipment shipments were delayed in our second quarter, further strengthening our confidence in the second half. Longer term, our portfolio at STERIS is essential to surgeries, either directly in the operating room or in the core support sterile processing department and we believe this provides us some insulation to our revenue base from our customers' rising cost of capital. Moving on to AST. AST grew constant currency organic revenue 19% in the second quarter as we continue to benefit from underlying demand from our core customers. In the second quarter, [MevX] improved significantly on both a year-over-year basis and sequentially, which pushed our growth rate into the high teens. As you have already witnessed, shipments can be lumpy with this segment of the business. Similar to Life Sciences, these are large pieces of capital equipment that are not booked as revenue until they are fully installed and tested. From a profit perspective, increased energy costs, both in the U.S. and internationally, are impacting margins for AST. All signs indicate this will continue at least through the winter. We continue to look for ways to recoup these costs as the contracts allow in the timing of our increases. Life Sciences revenue was flat on a constant currency organic basis compared with the prior year. Solid service revenue growth was offset by declines in both capital and consumables. We believe capital equipment shipments are just a matter of timing as about $10 million slipped into the third quarter versus our expectations. And as a reminder, the business had a very strong shipment quarter in Q1. Also, our backlog continues to hover around $100 million. We are optimistic about the long-term demand for our capital equipment in this segment. On the consumables side, we're about flat from a constant currency organic revenue perspective. This is primarily due to inventory management by our customers, in particular, in our barrier products line. Again, not concerned about the long-term underlying trends for the business as aseptic pharma production demand remains very strong. Our Dental segment declined 3% on a constant currency organic revenue perspective. While procedure volumes for Dental continue to hover around 95% of pre-COVID levels, year-over-year procedures have declined in the low single-digit range. We believe this is due to the current macroeconomic conditions. Despite the decline in revenue, operating margins were over 25% as we manage spending and experienced some relief on our supply chain costs. Turning to our full year outlook. Constant currency organic revenue growth expectations of 10% remain unchanged. However, based on the ongoing foreign currency challenges, we are revising our as-reported revenue. As-reported revenue is now expected to grow 8%, a reduction of 1% from the prior expectations due to continued foreign currency fluctuations. For the year, currency is now expected to reduce as-reported revenue by $150 million and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.15. The primary drivers of this continue to be the weak euro and British pound. Reflected in our revenue outlook is improved pricing. We are now expecting around 250 basis points for the year. Combined, pricing and disciplined spending will contribute to higher-than-planned operating margins for the fiscal year. This will help offset the impacts from foreign currency and additional supply chain inflation. For the year, we now expect an incremental $90 million in extraordinary supply chain and labor cost inflation, an increase of $20 million over our prior expectations. Factoring in these elements, our expectations for earnings are unchanged at the $8.40 to $8.60 range for the full fiscal year. However, with an additional 5% impact from foreign currency, we believe the high end of that range is less likely. Overall, our business continues to perform very well in this environment. Our teams and portfolios continue to come together to better meet the needs of our customers and the breadth of our offering allows us to take advantage of several significant trends in the industry by leveraging our relationships to cross-sell within business segments and deliver value to our customers. Before we open for Q&A, I did want to address the challenges the industry is facing on ethylene oxide. As you all know, ethylene oxide is essential to the supply of sterile single-use medical devices throughout the world. To date, the industry does not have an alternative to EO. And currently, in the U.S., there is very limited capacity to manage the long-term growth expectations for the medical products industry's demand for ethylene oxide processing technology. At STERIS, we take our responsibility very seriously as a provider of these crucial services and have always been committed to strict regulatory compliance and quality standards for the safety of our people, our facilities and the communities in which we operate. We are stewards of the long-term success of our business, which I believe is exemplified by our actions. We have regularly updated our processes and equipment used within our facilities to reflect the adoption of new technology and deploy the best practices possible. In addition, we have led the industry in developing sustainable EO cycles, which significantly reduced the amount of EO gas used per cycle. And we have worked closely with the U.S. FDA to ease the regulatory transition for our customers so they can more easily adopt these cycles. This diligence is consistent with the way we have operated our contract sterilization business for many years. I am confident in how we have run and continue to run these facilities and the improvements we have made to our process within the AST segment. With that, I will turn it over to Julie to begin the Q&A.
Julie Winter : Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, can you give the instructions, and we'll get started on Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: Just first, how should we think about the second half acceleration in organic growth? And kind of what are the key drivers around that?
Michael Tokich : Matt, the main driver is, as we continue to talk about is capital equipment shipments, in particular in our Healthcare segment. That is really going to be the factor that drives us from about 7% constant currency organic revenue growth to 13% constant currency organic revenue growth around there to achieve our 10% for the full year. So it's all driven by our ability to ship capital equipment in Healthcare.
Matthew Mishan: Have you secured the components necessary so that you do have the confidence that you will be shipping those?
Daniel Carestio: Matt, this is Dan. I would say we have a lot more confidence today than we had 3 months ago. There's no guarantees as it relates to the current environment with supply chain. But we do have a lot now that's in stock, and we are aggressively shipping as we can finish off machines. And I think that in terms of level of confidence from our suppliers that those shipments will continue to come in, in a more predictable fashion is pretty high.
Matthew Mishan: And then lastly, does it require an inflection in Dental? Or is it possible that you're still going to get the 10% with Dental like remaining flat to down?
Daniel Carestio: We believe the Dental business is going to stay suppressed until procedures come back. And I think that's tough to predict when that's going to happen, given that these are highly elective. And currently with inflation and everything else, it's something that we believe is good. We've got it modeled to stay where we got it year-to-date, more or less.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company.
Mike Matson : So I want to ask about the -- there's kind of a big difference in the growth between the AST business and then the consumables on the Healthcare side. And since I assume a lot of the AST volume is medical devices that are getting used in procedures or maybe will get used in procedures eventually. How do you kind of explain that? Do you believe that we're still below pre-COVID levels in terms of procedures, which kind of hurt your consumable growth in healthcare, but AST is still really strong?
Daniel Carestio: Yes. I mean it's -- there's three components of revenue, right? I mean there's price, there's share and then there's just volume growth. And what I would say is, generally speaking, for medical products, we've seen some recovery in terms of higher end, higher value whether that's neuro or whether that's spine or whether that's ortho, we have seen some recovery in those procedures. General surgery, we haven't seen any difference. In fact, it's still hovering at this pre-COVID -- not back to those pre-COVID levels and that's largely a function of staffing in the health care network. The other side of that is we're doing everything we can to recoup price as costs go up in that business. We have a long history of being able to successfully do that with our customers. And then the other component is share. Maybe we picked up a little bit of share over the last couple of years, and there's a long tail on that in terms of annualizing those run rates. And keep in mind, too, there is a significant portion of our business that's not pure medical products. There is some level that is process type disposables. And that part of the market continues to grow at a pretty high rate, and we've been benefiting from that.
Mike Matson : Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the EO regulations, I guess, do you have any sense for the timing on when those are going to be revealed? And then do you -- how do you feel in terms of where you're at with your PO practices? I mean do you think there's a potential that you would have to make any changes? I mean it seems like you really putting into place some pretty rigorous processes to reduce admissions. But I don't know if there's any way to go beyond what you've already done there, but --
Daniel Carestio: Yes. What I would say is this, I think we expect to see a rule draft sometime in the first calendar quarter out for public viewing. I mean, I've said that before, but I think it actually may happen this time. And so I do expect to see something out in public domain sometime in the first calendar quarter of the year. Now having said that, what I would say is that we have consistently invested and found ways to improve our processes. And I would say generally above and beyond the regulatory requirements that are out there. If I look back in our history, a couple of notable examples of those types of improvements would be where we proactively invested in our abatement technology and this is over decades, not in the last 18 months, including upgrading our flares with wet scrubbers and using catalytic oxidizers and developing also in the last few years, we've installed full abatement systems in our outbound warehouses in the U. S. AST locations for capturing any potential fugitive emissions. Within and around all of our EO chambers, we have significant safety measures and enhancements in place, including locks that don't allow the chamber door to be open until the prescribed amount of EO is met in terms of the chamber to ensure the safety of our people and maximum capture of ethylene oxide. And then also a significant thing around the STERIS AST, in particular, the U.S. locations is any of those sterilizers that have or had back vents have always, I repeat, always been tied into the emission control systems for maximum destruction of any potential gas coming out of the facility.
Mike Matson : Okay. Got it. And then just one on interest expense. It was a little higher than -- or I guess I should say other expense, but I think it's mostly interest. So it was a bit higher than what we expected. Is that because interest rates have gone up? And how much of your debt is variable rate? I don't know if you can give us any guidance on what to expect for the full fiscal year for interest expense, but --
Michael Tokich : Yes, Mike, it's definitely -- the rates have gone up. We're all in about 3.6% total, which is definitely higher than where we have been. And unfortunately, our projections are that rates will continue to rise. Currently, we sit at just over $3 billion of total debt, and it's about 70-30 fixed versus floating is our percentage.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson from Stephens.
Jacob Johnson: Just on the Life Sciences segment, it looks like the backlog growth decelerated some this quarter, kind of flattish growth volumes down. Can you just talk about demand trends from that end market? It sounds like maybe some of this is related to the timing of shipping orders, but any thoughts on that end market?
Daniel Carestio: Yes. I mean as those -- I'm sorry, this is Dan. As -- those shipments can be lumpy, so can orders because they tend to be pretty high value. I'm confident that our backlog, if we can can hold that around $100 million, that is absolutely outstanding for the long-term success of the Life Science capital business. And so I'm happy where it is, and our order intake is strong as well as we look into the future. So I think we just got to get the stuff shipped out of our plants, and we'll be working on that diligently over the next 6 months.
Jacob Johnson: Got it. And then just circling back on the Dental impairment. I think some of it’s related to near-term performance, but I suspect some of that might be related to rising interest rates. Can you just talk about those dynamics? And then I think you mentioned in your comments, no real change to your long-term outlook for that business, but I figured I’d ask about that as well.
Michael Tokich : Yes, certainly. And as I did say at the end of that paragraph in my prepared remarks, we believe that long-term outlook for Dental segment is unchanged and that we continue to see significant growth opportunities in that space. What’s really driving that is really – what’s driving the impairment, and we have to look at this at any time we have any indicating factors that goodwill will be – may be impaired the estimated fair value of that segment, maybe below its carrying value. And really what’s driving that is use of discounted cash flow model at interest rates, in particular, the rising interest rates in addition to the inflationary pressures we’re seeing on labor and material costs are really the two key factors that are driving us to impair all of the goodwill associated with the Dental segment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler.
Jason Bednar: And great to hear the progress in the component source in the quarter. It sounds like that's really going to contribute to a nice step-up in growth here in the second half of the year. But I'm going to pack a few questions in here on this topic. Dan, can you say whether those capital equipment delays late in the quarter that you referenced, are you catching up on those real-time? Is there anything we should consider with respect to your capacity to deliver against that backlog? Because, again, that is a pretty big step-up in growth. I just want to confirm that. And then finally, I can't imagine this is more aggressive shipping suddenly stops at the end of this fiscal year. So I guess, is it right to think of this equipment momentum continuing into fiscal '24 as well?
Daniel Carestio: Okay. Yes, sure. Thanks, Jason. In terms of your question around capacity, what I would say is this is we've been building machines without components now for the whole fiscal year basically. And because the demand is high, we can't lose a manufacturing slot. So we have a number of machines that at the end of the quarter, we're finished awaiting a $7 part before we could ship it to our customers. It's not literally, but almost literally, yes. So we continue to manufacture every slot that we have and then finish out equipment as those components show up on our docks, if you will. So I think we're in pretty good shape. But we've also historically have shown our ability to flex manufacturing pretty considerably in terms of -- if you look at historical performance of STERIS, we typically have a bigger back half than front half in terms of capital shipments. So our teams are able to do that, and they have a long history of doing that. In terms of momentum going into the next year, I think that's something that it's hard to look at right now, and it's not something we're discussing in terms of our future outlook in terms of what's going to happen in the -- I mean we've got 6 months left to deliver on that's critically important for STERIS and our customers right now.
Jason Bednar: Okay. Yes, fair enough. That's helpful. And then maybe a couple of clarification points. Mike, can you just confirm that the reaffirmed earnings guidance year-to-date contemplates additional rate increase, like it looks like we're going to be dealing with here over the coming months? And then secondly, just on the higher inventory levels that are causing free cash flow, the free cash flow guidance cut, does that continue -- do those inventory levels continue beyond fiscal '23? Do we get a reversal at any point? Just how do you see that playing out?
Michael Tokich : Yes, definitely on the inventory levels, we've continued to hold higher inventory levels all this year projected, the rest of this fiscal year, even last fiscal year. So hard for me to sit there and pinpoint exactly when we will turn that spigot off and once we do obviously, we will see a nice benefit to working capital. I don't know if that's going to be in '24 or beyond or timing, it's just too hard to predict at this point in time. We're just happy to get the inventory components and to shift the equipment for the customer. So more to come on that. And yes, we did bake in increased continued increased interest rates in our forecast. So that is already contemplated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: I want to ask about the back half and then '24 on equipment. And then maybe 1 or 2 follow-ups. On the back half, just as we consider our models, 13%. Real revenue growth for the total company year-on-year, but December quarter, lower than that. March quarter higher. Any flavor you can provide on phasing because clearly, the toggle in the spreadsheet is the Healthcare equipment revenue, and it's some pretty big numbers, and it's obviously difficult to predict quarter-to-quarter. So I think it'd be helpful just to level set like how you expect this to unfold the next 6 months between December versus March quarters?
Michael Tokich : Yes. In just looking at it, obviously, in order for us to meet our intended free cash flow, we need to ship capital equipment earlier so we can collect. So I would say that Q3 would be a little bit higher from a growth standpoint than Q4 would be if we're modeling this.
Daniel Carestio: Yes. But I would also say, to use your words, it is difficult to predict. And in terms of revenue recognition, at the end of the quarter, it's a different world today in terms of getting things accepted and received around the holiday season than maybe it was in the past with labor shortages. So we believe we're going to deliver on the year and I think trying to be extremely precise from Q3 to Q4 is a little tough right now.
Julie Winter : Caps do get much higher -- sorry, Mike, in the fourth quarter, we have 11% comps, constant currency organic -- Q4. So certainly, the comp issue as well in the fourth quarter.
Michael Polark: You talk me up versus my initial stab sequentially. So okay, I will consider. I appreciate that comment. And then I guess, look, I understand you're not going to comment on fiscal '24, but these equipment revenue numbers are potentially very large in fiscal '23. And I guess we have to take a stab at publishing a fiscal '24 framework. And it just seems kind of reasonable to think total company equipment revenue might kind of be down in fiscal '24 on a very significant comp as you unlock the backlog. Is that an unreasonable thought?
Daniel Carestio: Keep in mind, a lot of that backlog is in large project that could extend out into future fiscal periods. So it's -- the short answer is we don't know right now. I mean if order rates stay high like they have been, then there's no reason why we shouldn't continue to do incredibly well on capital. If they slow down, then that will impact it. I mean the good thing is, is that we have an awful lot of other business in healthcare that tends to buoy us on when capital slows and when capital is going great, it helps.
Michael Polark: If I could add one more on Life Sciences consumables, the kind of inventory management that you called out at production facilities. I mean, what inning do you feel like we're in did that just kind of start in biopharma? Are we halfway through the game? Any flavor for how long that's been kind of happening would be helpful?
Daniel Carestio: Yes, I think it's been happening now for a couple of quarters, and I think that we'll see a reverse trend in the back half of the year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities.
Dave Turkaly: Maybe just I've been jumping around, so I apologize if somebody hit this, but you mentioned the price again and almost 300 bps. It's a lot different than a lot of the companies we cover. So I was wondering if you might be willing to give us a little color either on divisions or geographies or products or like where it's mainly coming from or any of the drivers there? And do you think that's sort of sustainable?
Daniel Carestio: I think it's sustainable in the sense that we have an obligation as we have sustained higher cost to pass that on, wherever we can and wherever our customers can accept it. So that's something that I don't think is going to change assuming that we consider on this -- we continue on this rate of relatively high inflation and especially when there are certain components of inflation that are unique to STERIS in terms of having more meaningful impacts on costs, whether that's electricity or steel or electronics or things like that. So I think that that those trends will continue as long as they need to. In terms of breakdown of price by segments, we don't really weigh into that. I mean, clearly, health care hospital systems is tougher than some where we have contracts. But as those contracts roll from a GPO perspective, then we'll be incorporating appropriate new pricing levels.
Michael Tokich : Yes. The one thing I can say, Dave, is that we are getting price across all of our segments.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'm showing no additional questions, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter : Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us. We will be on the road quite a bit over the next few weeks, and we look forward to seeing many of you in person.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-08-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the STERIS plc First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Ms. Julie Winter, VP of Investor Relations. Ms. Winter, please go ahead. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. We do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, re-transmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited.

STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions is available in today's release including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call to Mike. 
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 6%. Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 240 basis points of price. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures added approximately $151 million to revenue in the quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. As a reminder, the Renal divestiture will trim revenue by approximately $45 million per quarter through December. During the quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Cantel Medical. Integration continues to go very well. We achieved approximately $20 million of cost synergies in the first quarter and are on track to achieve a total of approximately $50 million in fiscal year 2023. As anticipated gross margin for the quarter decreased 150 basis points compared with the prior year to 45.1% as pricing and favorable impact from acquisitions and divestitures and were offset by lower productivity and higher material and labor costs. Material labor costs continue to be a headwind and totaled about $30 million in the quarter. Despite the decline in gross margin, operating margin held flat at 22.9% of revenue compared with the first quarter of last year as we did a nice job of controlling SG&A expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21%. Net income in the quarter increased to $191.1 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.90. At the end of the first quarter, cash totaled approximately $316.3 million. We continue to focus on debt repayment as evidenced by our leverage ratio now being just below 2.3 times. Our focus on debt reduction continues to provide us great flexibility to make investments in growth capital expenditures and the capacity to pursue potential opportunities to expand our businesses. Capital expenditures totaled $115.9 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $138.9 million in the quarter. Our first quarter spend on capital expenditures was higher than anticipated, primarily, driven by the timing of investments within our AST segment. We still expect our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $117.1 million, as we benefited from increased net income, including a reduction in costs associated with the Cantel Medical acquisition, somewhat offset by higher capital expenditure spending. And finally, last week we announced our 17th annual dividend increase, which raised our dividend by $0.04 to $0.47 per quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us to hear more about our first quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the year. As you heard from Mike, we had a solid start to our new fiscal year and continue to experience strong demand for our products and services. I will review the highlights of the quarter and then shift my commentary to our revised outlook. Healthcare constant currency organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter. Strong capital equipment and service growth was offset by an organic decline in consumables, which is largely attributable to the timing of orders against very strong comparisons in the prior year. Hospital capital spending remains very robust, as evidenced by our health care backlog, which totaled over $500 million at the end of the quarter and our orders for the quarter were 40% large project related. AST grew constant currency organic revenue 10% in the first quarter, as we continued to benefit from underlying demand from our core customers. Growth was somewhat limited by the timing of large capital shipments from our Mevex business unit which can often be lumpy. Life Sciences also delivered 10% constant currency organic revenue growth in the quarter, with strong capital equipment shipments and solid mid-single-digit growth in our consumables business. Our Dental segment grew low single digits constant currency year-over-year for the quarter, as revenue was limited by supply chain challenges. Turning to our revised outlook. From a macro perspective, we have several things impacting our business. As you have heard from many of our peers, currency has moved significantly and the forward rates continue to indicate headwinds on for STERIS in both revenue and profit for the remainder of the fiscal year. In addition, the supply chain environment has been limiting our ability to ship capital equipment. We believe approximately $35 million in capital equipment shipments were delayed in the first quarter. While procedure volumes continue to recover, particularly in the US, we are not seeing recovery as quickly as anticipated. The key variable for that recovery appears to be staffing availability at hospitals, which seems to be limiting their ability to catch up with pent-up demand for procedures. Reflecting these challenges, we are adjusting our revenue outlook for the year. As reported, revenue is now expected to grow 9% and constant currency organic revenue is anticipated to be 10%. As you recall, we grew 13% last year. So double-digit constant currency organic growth on top of that is a significant goal, but one we believe is achievable due to the momentum in our business and strong capital equipment backlog. While, we are not overly optimistic on supply chain improvements, we do see pockets of improvement there. The real key for us will be relief on parts, in particular, electronic components. In many cases, components are needed to convert our significant work in progress inventory to finish goods so that they can be shipped to customers. As a result of anticipated easing and supply chain constraints, we expect revenue growth rates to increase at a faster pace in the second half of the year as compared to the first half. Factoring in these elements, our current expectations for earnings are $8.40 to $8.60 for the full fiscal year, a $0.15 decline from the prior outlook, with most of that decline due to foreign currency fluctuations. For the year, currency is now expected to reduce as reported revenue by $100 million and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.10. The primary drivers of this are the weak euro and British pound. Overall, our business continues to perform very well in this environment. The challenging environment we're in is no different for other companies. Foreign currency fluctuations are limiting both top and bottom line. Supply chain disruptions are slowing our ability to ship capital equipment and higher interest rates may negatively impact interest expense. Despite these macro challenges, fiscal year 2023 is still expected to be another record year for STERIS. Our teams and portfolios continue to come together to better meet the needs of our customers, and the breadth of our offering allowing us to take advantage of several significant trends, in the industry, by leveraging our relationships to cross-sell within business segments, and deliver value to our customer. Thank you. That concludes our prepared remarks. I will hand the call over to Julie, to start the Q&A. 
Julie Winter: Thanks Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, if you'll give the instructions, we can get started on Q&A. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we’ll begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mike Matson from Needham. Please go ahead with your question
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Joseph, on for Mike. I guess, just first question around guidance. So you guys grew 6.3%, in the quarter looking at 10%. Can you maybe give some detail on, what segments will be driving the acceleration there in the next few quarters? And if you can, maybe some of the pacing of that? 
Mike Tokich: Yes. Obviously, what hurt us this quarter is, capital shipments due to supply chain constraints. Obviously, as you heard Dan talk about, we do believe there are some pockets of strength that are out there. So we believe that capital shipments should continue to get released. Lower surgical volumes, we continue to believe, we're about 95% of procedure value at free COVID. So those should continue to get better. And then, the other big headwind for us outside of just as reported revenue is FX, which both -- is hurting both top and bottom line for us. As far as the year standpoint, in May we talked about a EPS split of 45% first half, 55% second half. We believe we are still on track for that. And as you heard Dan, talk about revenue will grow and increase sequentially, going forward with more of that growth happening in the back half of the year. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And then maybe just moving on to the backlogs. I guess, two things to start out. Are you seeing any order cancellations, or any risk that customers are turning to other competitors to meet the demand? I understand, they may also be dealing with the exact same issues as you, but -- I guess, maybe a second part on that. Is there any risk that there's any artificial -- I guess, artificial demand built into these backlogs let's say, from customers double ordering and then canceling the order, that's not fulfilled or going with the company that can fulfill the order first? 
Daniel Carestio: Yes – Joseph, we don't see any pattern at all, in terms of, order cancellation. And we continue to see new orders come in at a significantly strong rate. A lot of these are projects, that take longer term, and we've been able to prioritize those projects as they're ready to come online, to make sure we can deliver for our customers. And then we're managing through the backlog, as oftentimes customers projects slip, and others tend to get pulled forward. So we're managing our production, to meet the demand of the customer and shift product where it needs to go, when the customer needs it. It's just challenging right now, because it's a bit hand to mouth at times, with some of the electrical components. But no order cancellations, that we've seen at this point. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Julie Winter: Yes. And I would just add -- don't remember -- don't forget, we have Cantel in our backlog now. We didn't have Cantel, in the backlog last year. But definitely, as an uptick of about $60 million in the backlog number. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then, if I can just a really quick one. I think you guys, called out $30 million of increased costs from inflation. Is the $70 million for the year, you guys cited on the last call still accurate? 
Mike Tokich: Yes, we reached $70 million for the year. So, if you remember last year, we were not impacted -- we were impacted heavily -- more heavily in the second half of the year, than the first half of the year. So the $30 million, is the incremental piece. So $45 million last year of headwinds, and $70 million this year, is what we still believe. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you guys, so much
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Cooley: Hey good morning everyone and thanks for taking our question here this morning. I just wanted to start if we could on the backlog and your commentary around the supply chain issues. Could you help us think a little bit about how that backlog both on the Healthcare side but also on the Life Sciences front pulls forward versus historical periods? I think you mentioned 40% was project-related when you're in the current quarter in terms of the new order flow. I'm just trying to think about aging of that backlog a little bit here with these kind of supply chain disruptions that you just cited, you don't expect to get better necessarily in the short run. If you could just provide some color around that that would be appreciated. And then I've got a follow-up.
Mike Tokich: Yes, Chris, this is Mike. In regards to backlog, as we've talked about for some time, our -- we are getting nice order growth. But at the same point in time, our delays have probably more than doubled in what we typically would see for -- especially around Healthcare. And I'm talking more about the replacement cycles not the project cycle. So, typically, we would have told you that we get an order in from a replacement standpoint that order would be most likely filled within 90 to 120 days, so most likely in the quarter. That is probably doubled at this point in time. So, that gives you some type of indication as to the lead-times that we're expecting and we're talking to and telling our customers as we're taking the orders. I don't know Dan do you want to add anything? 
Dan Carestio: Yes, I would just add two things Chris. One, we can -- we are able to build. We are building product every day. We are not losing manufacturing slots. We have a lot of WIP right now though of machines that are 99.7% complete that are awaiting the Golden Screw, if you will, to finish it off in terms of some electrical component. So, we're -- as we get those components coming in, we'll be able to flush through a lot of backlog in a reasonable amount of time. It's just the timing of those components is still TBD in terms of how it lays out over the next couple of quarters. But generally speaking we're in a good position in terms of manufacturing.
Chris Cooley: Appreciate the color on that. And then if I could just for my follow-up can we maybe shift gears to the AST franchise? And you cited a little bit higher than anticipated CapEx there in the quarter corporately. I'm just curious if you could give us some color there about the continued build-out of the company's capabilities both domestically and abroad in terms of X-ray and when we could start to see some of that come online commercially? And if in fact that -- or I should say as that does come online, how that measure may not affect the operating margin profile of the business? Thank you.
Dan Carestio: Sure Chris. We had our first X-ray come online approximately a year ago in Venlo, Netherlands. And very successfully from an engineering perspective and very well-received from a customer perspective the facilities operating significant positive margins within the first year of operation which is not necessarily the norm. So, doing quite well. The next operation to come online at least domestically here will be in Libertyville, Chicago suburbs and that's likely to be Q4 timeframe for us. So no material impact on the current fiscal year. And then we have other builds going on the West Coast and the East Coast that will follow after the Libertyville operation comes online. And we have done significant expansions over the last 10 years or so. And the business has gotten large enough at this point that we really don't see any material dilution when we bring a plant online whereas when the business was $200 million that was not necessarily the story but it -- $850 million $900 million we don't see that dilutive effect on EBIT when we bring up a new plant. And also keep in mind, a lot of these expansions are on existing infrastructure. So, we already have a plant and we're just adding additional warehouse and additional X-ray capabilities or e-beam capabilities to the existing plants. So, they tend not to have the same drain on a cost perspective. 
Mike Tokich: But the goal this year as has been in the past couple of years about $100 million in total expansion CapEx for AST. 
Chris Cooley: Appreciate that color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan: Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just first on the change in organic growth from 11% to 10%. I couldn't really tell, was that due simply to a slower-than-expected recovery in procedural volumes, or was it also due to some expected push out of the backlog of healthcare capital equipment into the next fiscal year?
Mike Tokich: Matt it's a little bit of both. We haven't broken out exactly, but it is definitely -- both of those are impacting us on an organic standpoint.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And you guys had an organic growth decline in consumables in the first quarter. Was that expected, or was it like a change you saw like in June around procedures? And what do you think changed versus your expectations? So you guided sort of mid-to-late May. So you had a pretty good view of what the procedural environment was like midway through the quarter?
Dan Carestio: Yeah. Matt, this is Dan. Procedures here in the U.S. were slightly below where they were in the first quarter of last year, according to all of our data that we have at STERIS, but slightly. And so I don't think that had a material effect on the consumable consumption or shipments. The issue is really we had a pretty strong quarter last year, I think as there was some restocking going on in hospitals and some distributor orders. So I think it was just a matter of tough comps and timing. And I'm confident that will flush out in Q2.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then just lastly on AST and the sort of the change in organic growth from last several quarters still double-digit growth is still positive. Can you go back and explain, what you're describing around the timing of some shipments and growth being limited by that. What that actually is? And do you expect that to be on a normal trajectory -- maybe know what a normal trajectory is -- your previous trajectory as you get through the next couple of quarters?
Dan Carestio: Yeah. So that related to some capital equipment shipments from our Mevex business unit. And those are typically E-beam Accelerators and Conveyance Equipment Control Systems. And the issue is we don't recognize revenue until those things get fully installed and get through an FAT process and then we recognize revenue. To the extent that we have some delays either on our end from a delivery perspective or more often is the case as the customer is delayed on whatever construction or infrastructure they have to have in place for us to finish the project. So as a result, our system can be a few million dollars or more even $5 million, $6 million potentially. And if that slips from recognition perspective from one quarter to the next is pretty material in terms of impacting growth rate. So, normally we had planned to ship close to $9 or so million. And we shipped considerably less than that. I think had we moved the equipment the way we had originally planned, our organic growth rate, constant currency organic growth rate for AST would have been the mid-teens comfortably where it's been in the past. But the equipment business is a little lumpy right now. And as you know building anything either, whether it's our customers or us construction things are not necessarily tied to a definitive schedule these days.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And just a quick follow-up is how much is CapEx? And how much is capital equipment as a part of the AST business in a typical year?
Dan Carestio: It's small about $30-ish million, ballpark out of the eight or something, yes.
Matthew Mishan: All right. Thank you.
Dan Carestio: Yeah.
Matthew Mishan: Thank you.
Dan Carestio: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Polark: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A follow-up on the adjustment to the organic growth outlook, I'm just curious, why one point was the right number? Why not two why not three? Why not maintain the prior one? Like, philosophically, how you got there? How you feel about the adjustment? Is there risk? Where are the risks from here, or do you feel like you have a very proper set of inputs now? Any color on that helpful. Thank you.
Dan Carestio: Yeah. We talked a lot about it internally. And if not, for the fact that we are sitting on this enormous backlog number, it comes down to what's our confidence in our ability to execute and ship based on materials. And I think that things have changed pretty significantly even in the last few weeks, around our line of sight of when we'll start getting consistent component deliveries that we need to finish out this equipment. So, we have a little more confidence now that we'll be able to flush a lot of this out. in the back half of the year and we're already well prepared to do that. So that's what give us -- gave us the confidence to stay at 10%. And then I do believe that despite where procedure rates are now, I don't see us getting back to pre-COVID levels during our fiscal year. But we do anticipate them to tick up a bit barring there's no unforeseen new variants that shuts down hospitals again or something like that. 
Michael Polark: On the backlog, my perception has been generally the mix of that -- of healthcare equipment revenue ex-Cantel is 50:50 kind of OR SPD ballpark. As you look at what's sitting in the backlog that needs to be finished and shipped does it skew SPD or, or is it fairly balanced? 
Dan Carestio: It's typically heavier on the SPD side because we tend to do more term -- quicker term business on the OR side. So -- we have a lot of backlog in sterilizers and washers right now. 
Mike Tokich: And Cantel as well. 
Dan Carestio: Yes Cantel as well. 
Mike Tokich: That $60 million that we're talking about is 100% at SPD basis. 
Michael Polark: Yes. Okay. That's what I suspected, I appreciate that. On pricing, I believe the prior guidance for the full fiscal year included 200 bps year-on-year, Mike I think you called out 240 basis points in the quarter. So just anything to call out in the quarter, why it was higher than the guide or has the expectation for pricing in the guidance changed? 
Mike Tokich: I would say that our pricing -- 200 basis points of pricing for the year is still within our guidance. Every quarter could be a little bit different as typical, depending on the mix of the products and stuff like that. But the nice thing that we're getting, we actually are getting price segments for the first time in a long time. And obviously, as you guys know, we typically get less than 100 basis points of price. So, we've done a nice job of increasing the pricing power that we had to offset, as everybody knows the higher labor and material costs. And even then, we're not even offsetting it one for one, yes. 
Michael Polark: Again, do one last one on just how you're thinking about capital deployment. The balance sheet flexibility is starting to ramp back up. Historically you've liked to do deals. I'm curious kind of is that taking up a lot of time right now or is M&A pipeline kind of relatively slow activity? 
Dan Carestio: No, we continue to look at and do even some small sort of bolt-on acquisitions and we'll continue to do that over the next year or so. In terms of anything significant in size, right now we've got plenty of work finishing the integration of Cantel and also working through getting products delivered to our customers. So even though we have the financial firepower to do that, we want to get the business running and like it should be and continues to do so, so that we can do potential other business development in the future. But for right now, we'll probably take a couple of quarters off. 
Michael Polark: Thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.
Jason Bednar: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions here. I wanted to go back to the procedure volume softness that you referenced. STERIS clearly isn't alone as a staff issue seems to be hitting a lot of players here in Medtech. But I guess I wanted to take your temperature on your visibility, regarding how much of this truly is staffing which may recover more slowly versus something that might be a bit more transient like higher than normal COVID infection rates that might be leading to things like procedure cancellations and possibly perpetuating the staffing challenges. So are there any maybe regional variances too that stood out just on -- as the procedure volumes were coming softer than you expected?
Dan Carestio: Yes. Look it's complicated, is what I would say. And yes, there are unexplainable regional variances too. We saw a significant more of a decline in the Southeast than we did in the Midwest or Northeast or West Coast. Yes, I can't explain it to be honest with you, in particular that. What I would say is, the single biggest issue is staffing.  And your question did COVID uptick in June impact that, in terms of cancellations or staff shortages probably -- that probably explains a little bit of a percent or so decline versus what we saw in Q1 last year. But I'm guessing at this point. I truly believe it's staffing. Every single hospital CEO that we speak to their single biggest challenge right now is staffing and not just nursing. It's in general facility staffing, it's the janitorial, it's the food service. It's -- there's a reason why you're looking at inpatient rates dropping significantly in outpatient rates going up significantly because the hospitals just don't have the staff to care for people that are in-patients. 
Jason Bednar : Okay. Yes. Very, very clear. That's helpful. Thanks. And then on Dental based on reports from others out there in your comments today it sounds like challenges are just really just continuing across the Dental market. But love to get your updated view on how you see your Dental business do. And as you get it back on track, how much can you do to help STERIS maybe buck the trend of the broader market. And then is the sequential improvement in operating margin for that segment that we saw here today or yesterday. Is that sustainable? Then any time line you're willing to put on when that segment gets to kind of the above corporate average target that you've laid out in the past?
Dan Carestio: Yes. What I would say is Dental if not for the supply chain issues we had this quarter, would have had a really nice quarter in terms of growth. So we didn't lose that business that will just flow through in the coming quarters in terms of demand. And so I think that will sort itself out in terms of the overall financial performance on the bottom line, that is a process of continuous improvement, and it's something that we are going to work on every day, every month, every quarter, every year, but it's not there's no magic wand to do this correctly. So, we'll continue to do what we need to do to strip out waste and cost. Obviously, look at price where it makes sense, and continue to innovate with new products, so that we can bring high value to our customers. 
Jason Bednar : Got it. And then Mike just one more if I could a bit of a housekeeping item. Sorry if I missed this, but can you help with the currency rates for the euro pound and Canadian dollar that you're using and forecasting out the updated $100 million in FX headwinds for this fiscal year? Thank you.
Mike Tokich : Yes, certainly. So we use the forward rates and we use them as of the end of June. The euro is at a $1 -- or $1.060, the pound is at $1.222. Those are both significantly lower than what we planned originally.
Jason Bednar : That was perfect. Yes. Understood. Thank you. 
Mike Tokich : Yes. You’re welcome. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Turkaly: Great. Thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up. So if we're looking at your performance in Healthcare and then your guidance, I think, it was 4% this quarter. I mean, can you help us understand how you're able to grow, I guess, a lot faster if we're looking at flat to down procedures and maybe some improvement, but not totally back to where we were pre-COVID. Is a mid-single-digit range is that -- can you deliver that for that -- the largest business for you?
Dan Carestio: Yes. What I would say is, over the last year or so, we've done a nice job of taking share in our recurring revenue business, our services business, our chemistries business and BI or CIs. And we expect that to continue and help offset some of the natural appreciation that we would have hoped to have seen a procedure rate. Now the reason that takes us from mid-single digits or mid to high single digits into much higher than that as the capital backlog we're sitting on right now. And we continue to bring in backlog and grow or maintain that backlog based on our order rates. So that's the reason why we think we can get a much higher growth on top out of Healthcare is flushing through the backlog that we had at hand.
Dave Turkaly: Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on AST. Obviously, it's been -- it's delivered for you or you guys have executed well in terms of the growth profile. But -- how do you think of that looking out, maybe even versus your 10% for the company? I mean, is that a mid-teens grower on a consistent basis looking forward?
Dan Carestio: Yes, it's double digits, but it's not mid-teens. I think that -- I mean, it's done incredibly well over the last couple of years in terms of mid-teen looking growth rates. But having been in that business for 25 years, that has not been the norm for the life of the business. So, I would expect it to normalize back towards double digits or slightly below at some point in the future. I think for the short term, we're going to maintain above double-digit growth.
Dave Turkaly: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please go ahead with your follow-up
Chris Cooley: Thanks. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the follow-up question. I guess I'll get more than two in like everybody else. The -- quick question on cash flow. You guys maintained cash flow guidance for the full year, but it sounds like, there's obviously upward pressure on both, net interest expense, probably a little bit higher working capital need. I just want to make sure I fully understand the puts and takes that you expect to see throughout the remainder of the year that gives you confidence in your ability to hit that cash flow target that you previously established. Thanks, so much.
Mike Tokich: Yes Chris, two things there. Our collections efforts have been strong, which is helping improve working capital. And then as we've talked about for the last 25 minutes, the backlog, when we ship that backlog, we should get improvement in inventory which means it flows through to the receivables side. So that's where we believe, we have the ability to maintain our free cash flow projection at $675 million.
Chris Cooley: Thanks.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this point, I'm showing no additional questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Great. Thanks, Jamie and thanks everybody for taking the time to join us this morning.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-05-12 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Steris PLC Fourth Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, re-transmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are/or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings.  The company does not undertake to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency of organic revenue growth, and free cash flow will be [Indiscernible]. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions is available in today's release. Also, along with reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 11%. Growth was driven by organic volume, as well as a 120 basis points of price. Acquisitions added approximately $253 million to revenue in the quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. Gross margin for the quarter increased a 120 basis points compared with the prior year to 45.5% as favorable productivity pricing and acquisitions were somewhat offset by higher material and labor costs. We continue to face increased material labor costs, which totaled about $20 million in the quarter as anticipated.  EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.6% of revenue an increase of a 130 basis points versus the prior year. This is impressive performance as operating expenses, including R&D, increased, plus the continued headwind from supply chain and inflation. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.8% net income in the quarter was $205.4 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.04. At the end of the fiscal year, cash totaled $348 million. We continue to focus on debt repayment as evidenced by our leverage ratio, being now under 2.4X at the end of the fiscal year. Our focus on debt reduction provides us flexibility to continue making investments in growth capital expenditures and allows us many opportunities to continue to expand our businesses. Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $287.6 million while depreciation and amortization totaled $553.1 million. Free cash flow for the year was $399 million.  As anticipated, this is a decline from the prior year, due to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cantel along with higher Capital spending year-over-year. As we look forward to FY2023, we anticipate free cash flow generation of approximately $675 million, as the majority of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cantel have occurred. We also expect interest expense to be higher year-over-year, as rates continue to rise. Total non-operating expenses net is anticipated to be about $95 million. In addition, we expect to continue reinvesting in our businesses, with capital expenditures totaling approximately $330 million. With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Daniel Carestio: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for making the time to join us to hear more about our fiscal 2022, performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2023. As I look back on the year of fiscal 2022, it was a remarkable year for STERIS. Not only did we navigate year two of a global pandemic, but we also completed the acquisition of Cantel, while integrating Key Surgical, and successfully transitioned leadership. All while growing faster than anticipated. I want to start by thanking the people of STERIS for all they have done and continue to do to support our customers and each other. Without all of you, we would not be where we are today. We started fiscal 2022, with an expectation of 8% to 9% constant currency organic revenue growth for the year. After increasing our outlook twice this year, we ended the year with 13% constant currency organic revenue growth, well above our increased outlook. This growth was driven by continued out-performance of our AST segment, double-digit growth in healthcare, and solid mid-single-digit growth in the Life Sciences.  While Dental is not yet included in the constant currency organic revenue growth, the segment grew 4% year-over-year since the time of acquisition in June. From a profit perspective, we ended the year with operating margins up 100 basis points, despite absorbing about $45 million in unplanned supply chain and inflation costs related to labor. Helping to offset those costs, we were successful in overachieving our fiscal 2022, cost synergies targets for the Cantel acquisition, which added approximately $40 million to our fiscal 2022, results. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.92 increased 28%, compared with fiscal 2021, and reflect a new record for STERIS. Turning to fiscal 2023, at a high level, we expect another very strong growth year for our business.  Our outlook for total revenue calls for approximately 12% growth, which includes two additional months of the Cantel acquisition, offset by the impact of the Renal Care divestiture, as well as approximately $30 million in unfavorable foreign currency. Excluding all that, we anticipate constant currency organic revenue growth of approximately 11%. Importantly, this outlook assumes that the procedure volumes will normalize in the U.S. and that we do not experience any significant wave of disruption from COVID. Our constant currency, organic revenue outlook reflects volume growth and includes 200 basis points of favorable pricing. Pricing is essential to help offset the increased costs year-over-year. For FY2023, we expect an incremental $70 million in extraordinary supply chain and labor inflation costs, above the $45 million we occurred in FY2022. This is in addition to our normal low single-digit annual inflation amounts, always included in our outlook, which we will work to overcome every year. In addition to the anticipated headwinds from supply chain and inflation, our FY2023, operating expenses will be higher as we get back to spending on travel, sales, and marketing, and other expenses. R&D spending is also anticipated to be higher as we continue to develop and bring new products to our customers. Offsetting those headwinds, to some extent, will be cost synergies from the integration of Cantel, which is expected to be incremental by approximately $50 million from the FY2022 levels.  By the end of FY2023, we will be approaching $100 million in total cost synergies achieved. Taking into consideration all of the puts and takes, we expect to show modest operating margin growth in FY2023. Our full-year earnings per diluted share outlook is anticipated to be in the range of $8.55 to $8.75, or 8% to 10% growth over FY2022. Given all the moving pieces, we are pleased with this bottom-line growth outlook. As usual, the range does provide us some conservatism on the low end. But given all the uncertainty that exists, we believe it is warranted. All-in-all fiscal 2023, is expected to be another record year for STERIS. Our teams and our portfolios continue to come together to better meet the needs of our customers.  And the breadth of our offering allows us to take advantage of several significant trends in the industry by leveraging our relationships to cross sell within the business segments. I recently shared with our sales team in our first in-person global meeting in three years, that we honestly believe that STERIS is positioned better today to meet the needs of our customers than ever before in history. That concludes our prepared remarks for the call, and Julie, please give the instructions so we can begin the Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Chad, if you would give the instructions, we'd be happy to get started.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And the first question will be from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Chris Cooley: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a stellar year there in fiscal 2022. Just two for me, if I may, here this morning, first, just thinking about how you're looking at the year going forward, 11% constant currency growth obviously, is a lot higher than what we've historically seen. The company start out with -- [Indiscernible] there’s some different aspects to the business. Just would appreciate it if you can maybe call out where you're seeing strength, where you need to see some improvement just from operationally and from a divisional perspective? So, we can think about that in terms of the drivers, both of growth and then as a result margin as we go through the year? Then I've got a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Daniel Carestio: Yes. Thanks, Chris, this is Dan. Thank you for the question. In short, we're seeing a fairly robust recovery in procedure volumes on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we move back into more normalized volume in terms of pre-COVID levels. We're not there yet, we still have quite a way to go. And I think that the real governor on the recovery of those rates is going to be staffing and the challenges that -- that's generally present in the healthcare industry today, in particular in the hospital segment. Having said that as those volumes return, that significantly benefits both our global healthcare business, as well as the AST business. And we've seen in the last couple of quarters recovery of more and more devices coming through AST in particular that are more highly elective, high-value type devices.  So orthospine, things like that and of that nature. So as those procedures begin to recover and then start working off what's been a couple year backlog of pent-up demand, we're seeing higher growth opportunities than we've seen maybe in the past. In addition to that, were coming into the year with all-time record backlog from a Capital Equipment perspective. And as we hope to flush that through over the course of the year, that will obviously be a bit of a tailwind for us in terms of our revenue growth.
Chris Cooley: Appreciate the color. And then just as my follow-up, and I appreciate all the detail here, but a number of puts and takes when you look down to the middle of the P&L, as we go into fiscal '23. Just curious, you're talking about a return to normalcy when I think about SG&A more broadly higher R&D as well, just directionally, how much of this is a return to normal? How much of this is incremental investment that you're making for the sustainability of the growth of the business? Or was the business maybe under-invested in over the course of the last 18 to 24 months? Just trying to get a better feel for what structurally we should be thinking about longer-term just from an expense rate? Thank you.
Michael Tokich : Yeah. Chris, this is Mike. I would say that the majority of what we're going to experience, at least in the SG&A side is more a return to normal. I would not say that we were under-invested by any means, and as Dan said in his prepared remarks, we've had our first sales meeting in three years. So, you can imagine the expense of that compared to the last two years that we didn't have that. So those are the types of increases we're talking about. Where you're going to see a little bit of a step-wise change though, is in R&D. R&D we anticipate growing by double-digits in fiscal 2023, so we continue to make investments in R&D to bring new products across all of our businesses. So that is, if you look at the two, a step-wise change that we are continuing to invest for the long term. Not that we were under-invested by any means. We just think there's a lot more opportunity that we can bring forth, especially with the acquisition of Cantel.
Chris Cooley: I appreciate that, Mike. Thanks so much. And again, congratulations on a great year.
Michael Tokich : Thanks Chris.
Daniel Carestio: Thanks Chris.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll start with just the first quarter in '23. You've got a bit of a tougher organic comp, I think. I didn't hear any directional commentary around where you expect the revenue. Is it safe to assume you're comfortable where consensus was modeling things? I'd assume it's a lower -- you're expecting lower organic growth in the first quarter than the remainder of the fiscal year.
Michael Tokich : This is Mike talking to you. We have not made any comments. But to give you a little bit more color to help you with your modeling, we would suggest that from a first-half or second-half, we're about 45% percent first-half, 55% second-half, which is typical of how we operate. And to your point, I think I would say you are correct. We do have a little bit of a tougher comparison in Q1, but we're not going to give quarterly guidance at this point in time, and nor have we in several years.
Julie Winter : And just to clarify that's [Indiscernible] earnings.
Michael Tokich : Yes. You're correct.
Mike Matson: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. All right. And then You mentioned that there are some trends that in the industry they're [Indiscernible] STERIS, I just wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about that. I'd assume one of them is the trend towards ASTs, where the ASTs have to get outfitted with cleaning and sterilization equipment and whatnot, but maybe just talk about some of those industry-wide trends.
Daniel Carestio: Yes, that is one clearly, this -- sorry, this is Dan. And there's an awful lot of growth going on in investment, both in Acute Care and in ASCs across the U.S. in particular. And we're starting to see the recovery in Europe. So, we've been really well-positioned with our portfolio products, in particular with SPD and also in -- from an OR perspective over the past few years. And we're nicely positioned to fill that need and that growth that we're seeing as it comes. Yeah. The other tailwind that we're getting is, as I mentioned before, is just general procedural recovery which drives our consumables, that drives our services, it drives our AST business. So that's generally beneficial for STERIS whenever we see procedure rates on the rebound. And then last but not least, there's no shortage of investment going on in Pharma in terms of aseptic manufacturing as it relates to biopharma and to some extent vaccine as well.  So, we have an awful lot of backlogs in Life Sciences that's going to flush through this year as it relates to some of the expansions that -- in investments we've seen going on in the industry. And as those investments come online, that's a tailwind for us with our Consumables Business as they start to consume our chemistries and our packaging solutions.
Julie Winter : And our [Indiscernible] as well.
Mike Matson: Okay. Got it.
Daniel Carestio: And obviously, within AST that's driving biopharma and procedure recovery as a tailwind for our AST business.
Mike Matson: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then just as far as the free cash flow guidance goes, I mean, I'm having a little trouble getting to the $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities in my model. I mean, I'm coming in higher than that, but I -- the only way I could get there is assuming your working capital was up a fair bit. I mean, is that a reasonable assumption and that maybe you’re stocking up on inventory things, but pre -buying stuff because of the supply chain issues, we've heard that from other companies.
Daniel Carestio: Mike, that's exactly right and we have been doing that for probably the last 18 months, 2 years where we've continued to carry higher levels of inventory. When we shipped the backlog obviously the inventory and if supply chain does get a little bit easier, we will actually be able to bring that inventory level down as we go throughout the year. Our philosophy on inventory has gone from just-in-time to just-in-case. So, there's an awful lot of contingencies in supply chain continuity built into our inventory levels right now.
Mike Matson: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Daniel Carestio: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question is from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Matthew Mishan: Hey, good morning. I thank you for taking the questions. I just want to start first with the Healthcare Capital Equipment, at least versus our model, it looks like in came in a little late in the fourth quarter. Did some of the backlog shifts from the fourth quarter into FY 23.
Michael Tokich : Yeah, Matt, as we've been talking about the last couple of quarters, we have seen, roughly $30 million - ish that did not ship that would have been scheduled to ship on a normal course, if you will.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then if you look at it and you say that's adds a lot of [Indiscernible] As you compare the 11% organic growth for FY23, to what is a more sustainable level of organic growth, you back out that Capital Equipment. I guess, price is probably not 200 basis points moving forward. What do you -- how do you look at what is its sustainable level of organic growth compared to the 11% for '23?
Michael Tokich : Yeah, I would say Matt, we are still in the mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth on our long-term aspirations. Obviously, we've done better than that over the last several years, but in general, we would still stay with that forecast or that thinking from a long-term perspective.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then just Dan, just your longer-term thoughts on Hospital Capital spending as it progresses through the year? I think we've seen a couple of different opinions from some companies on where that's potentially moving.
Daniel Carestio: Yeah, and we've seen those opinions as well. I think some of the differences is, the Capital Equipment that STERIS is selling is typically $20,000 to $100,000 pieces of equipment, these aren't million dollars, $2 million machines. And the other point I would make is, everything we sell basically, is procedural rate-driven. And it's in, it's almost like a utility at times for the hospitals, they have to have it in order for them to accommodate an increase in surgical procedures. Whether that's lights and tables or whether that's stuff in the SPD. So generally speaking, given the cost of our equipment and the utility of it in nature, we see continued strong investment. And how long it will last, I don't know. But we don't see it changing anytime in the near future.
Matthew Mishan: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Polark: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. One clarification on the response to Mike Matson's question, the 45, 55, Mike Tokich, was that a comment on revenue progression 1H, 2H, or EPS?
Michael Tokich : Mike that was on EPS and welcome back Mike. Welcome back to covering us.
Michael Polark: There was three Mikes in my first question to you, three Mikes too many. And maybe on fiscal '23 to level set comments or frameworks like this have been made in the past. I don't think the -- I'm not struggling too much, but would you be willing to level set in your $5.1 billion give or take of imputed revenue for fiscal '23? How that splits out across the segments, just so we can work the model a little bit more precisely?
Daniel Carestio: We have not done that Mike, and I think at this point in time, we will not. But I will tell you that for the most part, if you look at growth, Healthcare is going to be exceeding their normalized growth. I would say Life Sciences will be somewhere in, maybe a little bit better than the normalized growth. AST we'll be at its normalized growth. And then obviously, Dental, we still don't have a true comparison at that point in time, so.
Michael Polark: Okay. Dental, what's the early assessment of Dental? I would say this is the one piece of the acquisition that hasn't impressed yet. How do you feel about that business? What is the work-streams and initiatives for fiscal '23 as you continue to integrated and learn that market?
Daniel Carestio: Yeah. It's Dan, Mike. So yeah, we're happy with the business. I would say it is more affected recently, in particular with the surge of Omicron that we saw in the January -- or February time-frame. And unlike Healthcare where it had very little effect. Just the broad level of infections across the U.S. in particular, ended up postponing or delaying a lot of procedures in the Dental space. And if you want to fact-check that, call your dentist today and see if you can get in before July because there's a lot of pent-up demand in terms of lost time in the first couple of months anyways, at this calendar year. So, we like the business, we think there's a ton of operating opportunities in terms of driving efficiencies through [Indiscernible] and continuous improvement. That's going to take us some time to wring out and make the business a little more efficient in terms of how they serve their customers. But other than that, it's on a steady track of recovery in terms of demand, barring what we saw the first couple of months in the calendar year.
Michael Tokich : And Mike, just to add to that a little bit. We grew 4% since the acquisition, which is a little below to Dan's point because of some of the COVID impacts, which is a little bit below the mid-single-digits anticipation that we would have for that segment, to give you some further clarity.
Michael Polark: 4%, that's like a pro forma -
Michael Tokich : Correct.
Michael Polark: - growth rate for the business? Okay.
Michael Tokich : Yeah.
Michael Polark: And if I can do one more, the comments in R&D are interesting. Obviously, STERIS is not overly reliant on any single product, and so I don't wish to overstate the importance of any single product category with this question. But I have noticed that you have recently launched, relatively recently, I think this year or late last. The single-use Ureteroscope, and I saw as a topic that seems to come up from time-to-time. And I'd just be curious about your efforts there. And if this launches an appetizer to some more products and that single-use scope category overtime. Thank you so much for taking the questions.
Michael Tokich : Sure, Mike. So yes, we're in a limited market release right now in terms of the new scope. And we've received a lot of positive feedback from key opinion leaders, and it's early, early days at this point. And we'll see how that goes and how it progressive over time. What I would say is that STERIS is uniquely positioned with our IMS business and vast understanding and engineering that we have around scope design from our repair perspective, and that collaboration with the commercial teams has put us in a nice position in the Urology space. And so, as that product begins to go into more realistic launch, we'll be able to provide some update and information on it. At this point, it's just too early days for us to discuss it.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dave Windley: Thanks for taking my questions, most of them follow-ups. You've commented on the recovery in volumes broadly and picking predominantly Healthcare and AST, but I'm wondering if you could comment on whether you see those -- the primary drivers of those volumes being recovery, demand as you've mentioned, how much might be market share gains and any other contributors to that?
Daniel Carestio: I mean, I think in terms of procedure volume, that's pretty straightforward, as we're back now in the U.S. market anyway, somewhere around 95% pre-COVID. Depending on where you are, region-to-region, some hospitals may be operating at 100%, others are operating at 90%. And over time, I think as provided, the staffing can step back up in terms of meeting the full demand, we'll see that improve beyond what we saw pre-COVID, because there is a lot of pent-up demand. But there's also a lag now, in terms of intake with the hospitals getting people back into the system, where they're diagnosing disease and moving them towards surgery where necessary. That is slower to recover as well.  So, it's going to take some time. In terms of overall rates and demand on the different businesses -- in terms of overall growth rate, I do believe we're taking a bit of share across the majority of the business here at STERIS. We've discussed that in the past and we've made very significant investments in our portfolio as it relates to Healthcare and Life Sciences over the years and also in significant capacity expansion investments in AST. And consequently, I think we're doing a little bit better than market in those spaces.
David Windley: Great, thanks and follow-up, different topic around capital structure, you mentioned leverage, I think was 2.4 times, mentioned rising interest rates and a big recovery in the coming year in your free cash flow expectations. Maybe just talk about general capital deployment priorities and is getting that how much floating interest rate debt do you have, and is the rising interest rate environment encouraging you to pay off more of that more quickly.
Daniel Carestio: Yes. I would say that in general, as we are anticipating about $675 million in free cash flow, that our capital priorities have remained basically the same for the last decade, or more. We're off the top. We believe in increasing our dividends. We've done those 16 years in a row. Next would be, to continue to invest in ourselves and we're continuing to do that. We're anticipating about $335 million of CapEx, which is almost $50 million higher compared to the prior year. And a lot of that CapEx is going to be continued -- directed into our AST segment, as we continue to expand our facilities and our opportunities in that segment. Third would be looking towards M&A. We've done over 50 transactions in the last 10 years or so. Most of those are tuck-ins in nature, and I would imagine that most of those, in the future, as we continue down the M&A path, will be tuck-ins. And then finally, just from a share repurchase standpoint, just to offset dilution. And we have that built into our plan for this year, we did do about $25 million dollars of share repurchases in Q4. But we had a hiatus on share repurchases for the last 18 months or two years. So, from a prioritization standpoint, that is how we operate and how we have continued to operate over the last several years.
David Windley: Thank you.
Julie Winter : Dave. Just -- I think you've asked about that about a quarter of our debt is floating-rate debt.
David Windley: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question is a follow-up from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Chris Cooley: Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just two quick follow-ups for me, if I may. Could you speak to the margin profile in the Dental business? Just trying to get a better sense of we saw a sequential progression downward throughout fiscal '22. How much of that decline in the fourth quarter was volume-related? It does sound like that impacted you from response to a prior question. But just when we should maybe start to expect stabilization there or maybe a lift better. And then it's just a quick follow-up. Bit curious if you could discuss or provide any additional color on when you think about the AST build-out that continues to take place emphasis on different sterilization modalities, in particular x-ray here in the United States and abroad. Thank you so much.
Michael Tokich : Dan, I'll take the Dental one and I'll give you the AST one; if that's okay?
Daniel Carestio: Yes, it sounds good.
Daniel Carestio: On the margin profile of Dental Chris, you are correct we have seen a degradation in our EBIT margins in that business. In the first quarter that we had Dental, they were still not being impacted like the rest of the business from a materials and labor inflationary standpoint, that has changed dramatically in the back half of our fiscal year. So that is one large driver impact -- negative impact to Dental. And then as we talked about earlier, volumes with patients have definitely had a negative impact of on that business. So, I would say that in general, we would look to have Dental above our corporate average as we continue to streamline that and get more ingrained in the operations of that business, longer-term, but definitely volume. And then the inflation is definitely having a larger impact on that segment on its own.
Chris Cooley: Understood.
Daniel Carestio: Dan Chris on the AST question. We're in the process of a pretty significant build-out across our network and actually across multiple technologies, we have a few e-beam plants going in, we've got a couple of EEO expansions, in addition to the numerous x-ray facilities that are currently in one phase of build or another, which construction during the COVID environment and labor shortages has been nothing short of challenging for the last couple of years, but it's definitely looking up recently. In particular, in the US, there's three facilities that will come online over the next couple of years. The earliest will be late -- very late this fiscal year, most likely in Illinois. And then followed by either California or Chester, New York.
Chris Cooley: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the Conference back up to Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter : Thanks everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning and look forward to catching up with many of you live in the coming days.
Operator: The Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-02-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the STERIS PLC Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. Speaking on today's call as usual, be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO, and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. And I do have just a few words of caution before we open for comments.

Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie. And good morning, everyone. It's once again, my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 9%. Growth was driven by organic volume, as well as 100 basis points of price. Acquisitions added $333 million to revenue, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. To assist you with your modeling within the healthcare segment of the approximately $210 million in acquired revenue, about 60% is consumable revenue from both Key and Cantel Medical. We passed the first year anniversary of the key surgical acquisition in mid-November. So this quarter Keys Surgical's revenue is split between organic and inorganic. Gross margin for the quarter increased 90 basis points compared with the prior year to 45.1% as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were offset by higher material and labor costs. We continue to face increased material labor costs, which totaled about $10 million in the quarter. As we look at the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, we expect increased pressure on material labor of approximately $20 million, about twice as much as we anticipated, just one quarter ago.  For the full fiscal year, we anticipate absorbing approximately $45 million, an unplanned material labor costs. All while continuing to serve our customers and deliver a record year of performance. EBIT margin for the quarter was 24% of revenue. An increase of 40 basis points from the third quarter last year. R&D expenses increased. And as anticipated, we are seeing operating expenses such as travel and sales and marketing costs return, somewhat limiting EBIT margin growth. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21% higher than last year, but in line with our expectations. We now expect the full-year tax rate to be approximately 21.5%, reflecting year-to-date actuals at our expectations for the fourth quarter. Net Income in the quarter increased to $213.3 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.12. Our Balance Sheet continues to be a source of strength for the company at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $359.1 million. We continue to focus on debt repayment as evidenced by our leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter below 2.6 times. Year-to-date capital expenditures totaled $214.5 million while depreciation and amortization totaled $319.3 million. Free cash flow for the first nine months was $300.3 million. As anticipated, this is declined from the prior year due to costs associated with acquisitions and integration of Cantel Medical acquisition and higher Capital spending year-over-year. I will now turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thanks, Mike. And thanks again to everyone for taking the time to join us today. Fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be another record year for STERIS. Our year-to-date results have been strong despite headwinds related to supply chain and inflation that are impacting both revenue and profit. In particular, growth in our ASG segment remains very strong with 21% constant currency organic growth year-to-date. Healthcare has also rebounded nicely with 13% constant currency organic revenue growth in the first nine months and record backlog of $382 million at the end of the quarter. Life Science consumables have stabilized as anticipated months. The capital equipment backlog in Life Sciences has also continued to grow to a record $117 million. As our backlog in healthcare and Life Sciences suggests, the underlying demand for our products remains very strong. Dental revenue was about flat in the quarter impacted by a slower-than-expected recovery in patient volumes. We do anticipate that that revenue in the dental segment will begin to rebound in the fourth quarter. The integration of Cantel is progressing ahead of our expectations, as we indicated last quarter. We expect to exceed our cost synergy targets by about $10 million and we're now approximately 35 million in total cost synergies in fiscal 2022.  Reflecting our strong performance to-date, we are increasing our constant currency, organic revenue outlook to the high end of our previous range and now anticipate approximately 11% growth for fiscal 2022. We are also increasing our earnings per diluted share outlook and now expect earnings to be in the range of $7.85 to $7.95, or $0.10 above the high-end of our prior outlook. We do have a few known headwinds in the fourth quarter. We completed the divestiture of our renal business, which will reduce both revenue by about $45 million and diluted EPS by about $0.05 in the quarter. In addition, we expect supply chain and inflation to be incrementally worse by about 10 million sequentially, as Mike discussed. We do anticipate that we can offset some or all of those headwinds with higher cost synergies from the Cantel integration and continued operational improvements. However, we're leaving some room on the downside of our earnings range to reflect the continued uncertainty. All said, we are very pleased with where we stand today in the underlying strength of our diversified business. I want to thank all of the associates at STERIS for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers. We look forward to updating you all with our progress in the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thanks, Mike and Dan. Matt, if you give the instructions, we can get started on Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session to ask a question [Operator Instruction]. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question will come from Matthew Mishan with Key Bank, please go ahead.
Matthew Mishan: Good morning and congratulations on a really great year-to-date so far. My first question is on the progression of organic growth. If I'm modeling it correctly, I'm coming in somewhere in the fourth quarter, around 5%, which would be a sequential deceleration. How should we be thinking about that in terms of the procedural environment? And then also, how should we be taking into account your ability to shift on healthcare Capital Equipment backlog given the, really, the massive number you have in orders versus maybe in a difficult DDI in supply chain and getting those actual customers.
Dan Carestio : Yes. I think the issue on the 5% is that the comps get tougher in terms of what we're looking at Q4 of last year. And we've also baked in what we believe is some slowdown that we saw in January and continuing into some of February in terms of procedures as it relates to Omicron, in particularly across the U.S. We believe we've got that appropriately factored into our expectations. In terms of the capital equipment we're -- at this point we're almost halfway through the quarter. And we have, in our model, forecasted that we're providing an assumption that there's going to be some hold-back of equipment that won't go, just due to timing. It's not an issue that we expect from an availability standpoint.  It's more of an issue of some extent, our customer’s appetite to receive that equipment within the quarter. Nonetheless, that I think what we've stated before there was about somewhere around $20 million increase in backlog that we would have attributed to deferral or supply chain issues and things of that nature. I don't think Matt that will flush that out this quarter, and I think it would be unreasonable to expect that in the current environment, but we'll carry that backlog forward into the first quarter of next year.
Matthew Mishan: Excellent. And then onto the operating margin, I mean, again, record operating margin in a difficult environment. How should we be thinking about the offsets? You guys have had to the inflationary impacts. As we look at the corporate costs, the corporate costs or the other costs, as low as [Indiscernible] did come down significantly from 2Q into 3Q. Are those the Cantel synergy starting to be realized? And are they may be coming in a little bit faster than they were previously -- than you'd previously thought?
Michael Tokich: Yeah, Matt, this is Mike. So yeah, we do we did anticipate that we are going to get more cost synergies and you are exactly right, those are going to show up first in the corporate side, as we have taken the opportunity to reduce the redundancy of the corporate costs, reduce the redundancy of the CEO, CFO. So that's where you're actually seeing those cost synergy savings. And as Dan spoke earlier, we anticipate overachieving those cost synergies in this fiscal year by about $10 million. Some of that has already been reflected through the third quarter. There will be a couple of single-digit million dollars that will still come through in the fourth quarter. But all in all that is very favorable to us. The other thing that we're seeing, and I think we're like everybody else as our operating expenses have been bouncing around, especially around travel. We were anticipating more travel in the third quarter, which didn't happen. So you're seeing that a little bit lower operating expenses in total.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. So there was nothing really transitory, and in those numbers that would necessarily bounce back significantly into the fourth quarter. And we're sort of at a good run great on some of those other costs.
Michael Tokich: Yes for the most part, I mean, the all the variance that I would see being out there is we are starting our fourth-quarter is the New Year from a calendar year from a benefit standpoint. So you will see some benefits costs that are normally higher, but year-over-year, those should be equal. And the other thing is at the end of the day, where does the management bonus occurring if there is an over achievement, obviously, you will see that also reflected in the fourth quarter.
Matthew Mishan: Understood. Thank you.
Michael Tokich: You're welcome man.
Operator: Our next question will come from Chris Cooley with Stephens, please go ahead.
Chris Cooley : Good morning, everyone and congrats on a great quarter. And what looks to be a great setup going into next fiscal year. I know it's a little bit early for fiscal -- the next fiscal year guide, but just maybe with broad strokes as we look at the business following on Matt it's an initial question. Capital in particular in healthcare, really has stepped up over the last several years and you do have a record backlog that you just alluded to won't pull-through all the way here in the fiscal 4Q. Could you just help us think about kind of the end markets there? Do we see a step-up in the kind of baseline growth rate for healthcare capital going forward? Is that a function of replacement? More efficiencies, or is this something that we should really think about normalizing kind of reverting back to those historic levels of growth on the healthcare capital side as we get out sometime in mid-year by -- at least by mid-year next fiscal year? And I've got a quick follow-up.
Dan Carestio : Sure, Chris, this is Dan. What I would say is there is some parts of the backlog build that we're seeing now that pent up demand on replacement. Things that just didn't happen for -- at the same rate for six or nine months during the early -- first year or so of COVID. There is some element of that. However, what I would say is the capital-spending we're seeing from large hospital systems, in particular across the U.S., and as well as surgery centers, and things like that nature, is unprecedented right now. And we're well-positioned with a really strong portfolio of Capital Equipment in Life Sciences, and then also in our surgical business, and our IPT business. And I think we're probably winning more than our fair share at this point in terms of our performance in the market. But the market is very hot and I don't know that I've ever seen this level of investment from our customers that we're seeing today. And I don't see it slowing in the short-term anyways.
Chris Cooley : Thank you appreciate that color. And then just kind of shifting gears to the Life Science segment. I continue to be impressed with the operating margin contribution that we see there as well as with AST. Can you just speak about, thematically, where you're seeing both of these portfolios product mix shifting towards? And really what I'm getting at here, do we is this a stair-step where we're kind of flattening out here in these record levels for a little bit. But as the mix continues to shift, you have a chance for another step-up in margin, or do we need to think about the operating margin contribution from here really becoming more a function of volume through the plant expansion at the AST side. As we just think about it dramatically going forward. Thanks so much.
Dan Carestio : I think in terms of AST, I would definitely point to volume and we have a number of legacy older plants that are quite full, tend to contribute at the high end of margin the portfolio. The newer plants as they, they come online are somewhat diluted on a percentage basis. But in aggregate with the total business, it doesn't really have a significant impact because there's been a steady diet of those plants coming on over the last few years. We would expect -- with the exception of OpEx coming back, we would expect the margin rate in the ASP business pretty much. In terms of the Life Science business, the one caveat there is that there is some lumpiness to our capital shipments from quarter-to-quarter. And the Capital Equipment business is generally at a lower margin than our service and our consumables business. In a whole, as we continue to grow consumables at a nice rate, that will have an impact on the overall margin of the business. However, if we keep taking orders on the capital side of the business like we have, I'm not sure that that is going to hold up.
Chris Cooley : Understood. Will congrats again on a great quarter. Thank you.
Dan Carestio : Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] our next question will come from Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson : So I want to ask one about the renal care sale. We had estimated kind of $0.12 to $0.13 of dilution on an annualized basis. But I think you called out about $0.05 in the fourth quarter. Is that quite more like a $0.20 number on an annualized basis? And then can you just me what segment that falls or had fallen under previously that revenue from that business?
Michael Tokich: Mike, this is Mike. The majority of the revenue was falling under the healthcare side. So if you're going to adjust the model going forward, there was there was a small piece that was at the Life Sciences business, but nothing really material. And then as far as I've seen a couple of different numbers is it $0.03 is it $0.05. Some of this is IR math if you will. But part of the issue is we are anticipating paying down debt in the fourth quarter with the proceeds. We did not get a 190 million a portion of that was. Held back in escrow. We did not pay down debt on 12 it took us a while to clear the maturities that we have as a 30-day maturities that we waited to pay down debt. So there's some moving pieces here. Again, our best guess is it's around $0.05, so I wouldn't dramatically change for next year if it's $0.04 or $ [Indiscernible], who knows, but again, more IR Matthew [Indiscernible] than anything more directionally, didn't give you an indication.
Julie Winter : And [Indiscernible] about half capital as you're doing your modeling.
Mike Matson : Okay. Got it. And then, just the really strong AST growth. I think it's in the past, you had had some kind of COVID benefit in there from PPE and things like that. I mean, was that a factor at all this quarter for this really just demand for your kind of normal medical device customers?
Dan Carestio : Yes, its demand from our normal med-tech customers, and PP&E is diminished back to pre - COVID levels or less than right now.
Mike Matson : Okay. Then just finally given the strong backlog, great to see that, increase in backlog. I'm wondering to what degree is that a function of the really strong orders that you're getting, clearly, is there some role for the supply chain issues there, maybe limiting your ability? Could you meet this -- fulfill those orders more quickly if these supply chain issues weren't happening right now?
Dan Carestio : They would move a little quicker through the plant, but the percentage increase that we have in backlog is unreasonable to expect our factories to turn as the same rate that we were six or nine months ago Realistically. I think we said last quarter about $20 million of capital shipments were deferred because of supply chain issues either on our end or on the customer’s end of things. And like I said, I don't think we're going to flush that through this quarter. It's going to take some time for those things, working themselves out. And the other thing too is a lot of these orders because a lot of it, long-term capital investment from particularly the healthcare sector, they're not asking for them to be delivered on March 15th necessarily. So there's time to get the fill delivered for customer needs when they actually need to put them in place and get operational.
Mike Matson : Yeah okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
David Turkaly : Hey, good morning. Can you hear me right?
Julie Winter : Yeah.
David Turkaly : A bit of a spot, but Mike, I think you said leverage is at 2.6 and obviously the last [Indiscernible] you did have been very [Indiscernible]. So I just wanted to get a comment on maybe your appetite year and where that leverage could go or what's your capacity right now to do deals like that?
Dan Carestio : Yeah. As I mentioned, we have brought leverage down below 2.6 times at the end of Q3, obviously, with the additional payment of about a $170 million that we will put forward for the Renal divestiture. Obviously, leverage will continue to drop lower than that by the end of the fiscal year. So right now, we are have the ability to more than one times for from a leverage standpoint to do something from an M$A standpoint. As we've been saying all along, the larger deals are few and far between. We will start getting back to more, I'll call tuck-ins, but again as everybody knows, we've been really more focused on the integration of both Key surgical and Cantel Medical. So the business development has been slowed at this point in time. But we are getting back towards, with leverage being below 2.5 at this point going forward. We are back to looking at opportunities to continue to grow the business, but more from a tuck-in standpoint as what you've seen in the past. Thank you for that.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Matthew Mishan with Key Bank. Please go ahead.
Matthew Mishan: Great. Apologies if I missed it. I think previously you had reported FY '22 numbers are on like $4.6 billion. Is it fair -- just is it -- is that number still relatively intact or are we -- 4 are we closer to 4.45 or 4.55 now with the divestiture?
Dan Carestio : I would say Matt, I would still use [Indiscernible] math and round up to 4.6.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then on the inflationary impact into the fourth quarter. Are you sort of reporting this on a lag basis where you buy inventory at a higher cost, a couple of months ago. And then it starts coming through in January, February, March, or these the spot prices that you're seeing in the current market that could actually flow through in FY'23.
Dan Carestio : Know this, this will be the actual amount we anticipate based upon the inventory turns at our various capitalization that we're talking about.
Matthew Mishan: Is it something in which is getting better through on us, at least on a spot basis, where you see going out a couple of more months, the prices are starting to come down, or should we think about this $20 million level incrementally flowing through into next year?
Dan Carestio : This is this Dan is too early to say we have definitely seen spot prices for certain materials come down precipitously. And we've seen other ones where we have vendors not even willing to quote us cost three months out based on uncertainty on there. And so our hope is that we see it come down over the next three to six months. But I think we're going to be living with some of these supply chain challenges for a while.
Matthew Mishan: All right. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to A - Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter : Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. We know it's a busy earnings season and look forward to catching up with many of you offline.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2021-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the STERIS, PLC Second Quarter, 2022 Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Grant (ph), and good morning, everyone. As usual, speaking on today's call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO, as well as Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today.  Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation. Those risk factors described in STERIS as securities filings. The Company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS SEC filings are available through the Company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency, organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used.  Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions is available in today's release, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational [Indiscernible] thinking. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 12% with growth across all segments. Growth was driven by organic volume, as well as 130 basis points of price.  Acquisition’s total added $346 million to revenue in the second quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. To assist you with your modeling. I will share some color on the acquisition revenue contribution within the healthcare segment. Of the approximately $220 million in acquired revenue, about 65% is consumable revenue from both Key and Cantel Medical, about 20% of the balances Capital Equipment revenue, with the last 15% being service revenue.  We will not be breaking that down any further as it's already difficult to differentiate some product lines as we are integrating the businesses quickly. And that challenge will only increase with each passing quarter. Gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points compared to the prior year to 46.2%, as favorable productivity, pricing, and acquisitions were somewhat offset by higher material and labor costs. Combined, material and labor costs were about $10 million in the quarter, significantly higher than we were expecting.  As we look at the second half of the fiscal year, we anticipate that higher material and labor costs will continue to impact gross margin by approximately $20 million or more. EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.3% of revenue, an increase of 80 basis points from the second quarter of last year. As anticipated, we're starting to see some operating expenses, such as travel and sales and marketing costs return, somewhat limiting EBIT margin growth.  The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22%, higher than last year but in line with our expectations for the full fiscal year. Net income in the quarter increased to $200.3 million and earnings per share were a $1.99. Our balance sheet continues to be a source of strength for the Company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter is now below 2.8 times. As a reminder, we cash settled all of Cantel's convertible notes during the second quarter.  The total cash settlement value was approximately $371.4 million. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $383.5 million. During the first half, capital expenditures totaled $133.4 million, while depreciation, amortization was $201.7 million, reflecting recent acquisitions. Free cash flow for the first half was a $135.8 million. As anticipated, this is a decline from last year due to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cantel Medical and slightly higher capital spending year-over-year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thanks, Mike. And thanks again to everyone for taking the time to join us today. Our fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be another record year for STERIS. Our first-half turned out to be stronger than we anticipated, with constant currency organic growth across the business. In particular, growth in our ASG segment remains strong with 23% constant currency organic growth year-to-date despite some tough comparisons in the second quarter of last year.  Healthcare has also rebounded nicely with 17% constant currency organic growth in the first half and record backlog of $311 million at the end of the quarter for the legacy STERIS products. Life sciences consumables have stabilized contributing 3% constant currency organic growth in the first half, and our capital equipment business backlog has grown to a record 98 million. Lastly, our newest segment, Dental, reported 10% growth for the quarter in line with our expectations.  Underlying our performance procedure volumes in the U.S. have held steady as hospitals have learned how to manage through the pandemic. While we continue to see pockets of the world that are more limited in procedure volume due to COVID outbreaks, overall, we believe procedure volume is moving closer to pre -pandemic levels. We are cautiously optimistic about the coming months as COVID cases appear to have peaked and are now once again receding. Despite the more difficult comparisons, we expect revenue to stay strong in our second half as we continue to benefit from these trends.  We also continue to make progress on the integration of Cantel in the quarter. The majority of our staffing changes have been made, aligning STERIS to better serve customers, positioning us for growth going forward, and contributing to cost synergies. We're also making swift progress implementing Lean and we're very pleased with how receptive our new colleagues are to our passion for continuous improvement. All said, we would expect to exceed our synergy cost targets for the year and also in total.  Looking at the full year, while we are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve the -- our improved outlook provided last quarter, we're not increasing guidance further at this time. While we overachieved earnings in the second quarter, we have a fewer offsets that will likely impact the back half of the year. On the revenue side, our comparisons do get a bit more challenging. And we do expect some headwinds from FX, in particular, from the euro and the pound.  In addition, while our teams have done outstanding work to mitigate the supply chain challenges so far this year, it is difficult to predict the unknown implications the current environment may have on the second half of the fiscal year. All said, we are pleased with where we stand today in the underlying strength of our diversified business and remain optimistic that if it were not for supply chain and inflation uncertainties, we would be at the high end or above our adjusted EPS guidance range for the full year. We look forward to continuing to update all of you on our progress. Thank you, and I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A. Julie.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan for your comments. Grant, would you please get the -- give the instructions and we can get started on Q&A?
Operator: Sure thing. We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Matthew Mishan : Good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter in a difficult environment. Dan, I just want to clarify the supply chain comments. First are you seeing supply chain issues right now that are impacting your ability to deliver on product? And I'm -- and I guess what I'm asking is, as you go out to the -- your third and your fourth quarter, where are you potentially looking at having supply chain constraints? Does it impact you potentially with your backlog in capital equipment and being able to deliver in 3Q and 4Q?
Dan Carestio : Yes. Sure, Matt. What I would say is to date, other than the cost escalation of money of our precursor materials, we've been able to navigate the supply side of it and make sure that we have been able to keep up and meet customer demand. And we had a little bit excess precursor inventory coming into the year as well, as some safety. In the current environment with the uncertainty around delivery time of these materials, it may -- it could potentially result in extended lead times for deliveries.  We don't see a scenario where a stock out would happen or anything like that, but the ability to deliver on what now is over $400 million in backlog in the next six months just from an -- if we miss production slots, it's going to be hard to get them back, if we miss them because of supply shortages. So, I believe our teams will continue to do the outstanding work that we've been doing thus far. But there are challenges.
Matthew Mishan : Understood. And then switching over to AST, where your growth is still -- has been exceptional. I typically view this business as more tied to medical devices, but I guess how should we think about biopharma now as a percentage of sales and opportunities moving forward? I'm just trying to understand like the total bioprocess opportunity and where we are with it.
Dan Carestio : Yeah, it is a high-growth area for that business. Currently, it's not a significant portion of the total business. And the vast majority of what we do, say over 80%, is what I would categorize as traditional medical type product. But nonetheless, it's growing very fast and we have a very good position with the companies and our customers that are accelerating growth and making a lot of investment for their capacity.
Matthew Mishan : Okay. And just lastly, on the raw material inflation which impacts in -- I just want to clarify that you expect 20 million or more and then -- in the back half, so that's in the next two quarters. And whether or not you're seeing some of those costs peak out and start to decline. Where that would be a worst-case scenario for you at this point?
Mike Tokich : Yeah, Matt. So, we experienced about $5 million of material labor costs in Q1. That doubled in Q2 and what we anticipate for the second half is $20 million or more for that combined third and fourth quarter. How that lays out by quarter, it's anyone's guess at this point in time. You read a lot in the papers about supply chain is potentially alleviating, although we have not seen that yet. Obviously, it's impacting us more than we had just thought 1 quarter ago when we revised guidance, so we wanted to make sure that we -- you guys understood exactly what we're anticipating to be the impact as we move forward for the rest of the fiscal year.
Matthew Mishan : Okay. Thank you.
Mike Tokich : You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Dave Turkaly : Good morning. That material and labor, the $10 million, is that split pretty evenly? And I guess the question I'd like to hit as well is, if it's $10 million in the next two quarters? You beat the Street significantly this quarter, so I'm just curious as to why we might not see that happen again, maybe even along with the synergy comment you made looking at the back half of the year.
Dan Carestio : Yeah, Dave, the split is more like 60% materials, 40% labor, just to give you an understanding of that breakdown of $10 million. And I think Dave, from our standpoint, there is just so much uncertainty surrounding the potential impact. Maybe we're being a little bit conservative at this point. But again, it's the best guess that we have as to the potential impact. And again, it's for two quarters in, we have been surprised in the amount that we've been impacted negatively on the gross margin side for both materials and labor. And I would just add, Mike, too that I think we have a fairly decent idea clearly of what's going to happen relative to materials and labor cost escalation going into the third quarter. I don't know that we can say that with a high degree of confidence when we talk about fourth quarter. So, if we were a quarter out of fiscal year, I think we might have a different position here.
Dave Turkaly : Got it, thank you for that. And then you mentioned exceeding the cost synergy. I'd love you to put a parameter around that. I don't know if there's a percent or any kind of number you could give. And also have you identified -- are there any revenue synergies because I think we hadn't spoken about those in the past. Thanks a lot.
Dan Carestio : Yeah. I would say that we're very confident on exceeding the $25 million target. Much of that is, what we would say, is in the bag because a lot of it has to do with executive compensation, and public Company costs, and a number of things that are already in the run rate. We still have some things to go get between now and the end of the year. And as we do that, we will get more and more confident on what the actual number will be, but we do know that it's going to be north of the $25 million.
Dave Turkaly : Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens, please go ahead.
Chris Cooley : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions and congrats on another solid quarter. Maybe just two quick ones for me. I was hoping you could address profitability and maybe the composition of the backlog. Specifically, when you look at operating profitability, you are hitting record levels both at AST and also at life sciences. Looking back through my model, I can't find if it's been like this before.  I guess in addition to the growth, I would like to better understand what's enabling you to reach these incredibly high levels of operating profitability? and then how sustainable they are? When I think about both the AST and the Life Science segments, is that a revenue mixes specific? Is that something that's structurally that's changed? I just want to better understand that, and then I'll follow back up on my backlog question.
Dan Carestio : I'll hit on the AST and I'll ask Mike to cover some of the Life Science s since there's a little more detail there. I think in terms of AST, we still haven't seen OpEx as comeback -- OpEx come back to where it was pre-COVID, and we've planned it to be back sooner than later. The other thing I would say is that we have a number of facilities that are operating at extremely high utilization levels right now.  And the nature of the business is such that there's a very high fixed cost on each one of these individual plans and the difference of running at 80% utilization versus 97% or something like that has got major implications on the drop-through profitability of the operations. So, as we've talked about a number of times, we're in the process of building out a number of expansions in that business. And then as those come online, we're not going to see any significant drop in profitability percentages, but we do believe going forward it will stabilize in the ranges of where it is today.
Mike Tokich : And then Chris on the Life Science s side, echoing Dan 's comment regarding the operating expenses, same in Life Science s. We anticipated higher operating expenses throughout the year and obviously, the COVID impact has slowed some of the travel, and marketing, and sales expenses. Although we are starting to see those come back, but that is one factor that is definitely adding to the increased operating profit.  And the other one you alluded to already, Chris, is mix. We continue to see very good growth out of the consumables business. And with the addition of Cantel, the consumables business, although it was only up a percent organically it is up almost 11% if you include the Cantel acquisition. We are seeing, as I think you understand, and consumables are higher margins -- tend to be higher margins for us, so that is also helping drive the improved profitability margin
Chris Cooley : [Indiscernible], that really helps. And then just on the backlog, look in total or just course there is record backlog that you are seeing there both in healthcare as well as in life science sector. Could you split out for us just kind of the composition of that backlog in terms of new build, etc. When we think about the healthcare piece and on the Life Science side, I continue to be on the wrong side of this equation, but it just remains extremely strong.  And I'm trying to grapple a little bit with where you're seeing the greatest level of demand right now and how we should think about that going forward is this kind of again a mid-single-digit or low double-digit type capital growth when we think about the Life Science component going forward over the next kind of 12 to 24 months. Thanks so much.
Dan Carestio : Sure, this is Dan. What I would say on the healthcare backlog, it's really strong across all product segments at this point, whether that's surgical or IPT. And then in terms of project versus short-term work, a year ago, we were almost exclusively long-term projects and builds and things like that, and we've seen a significant recovery in the replacement business in the last six, seven months, I would say, to where it's kind of back to pre - COVID levels in terms of replacement type spending. We've got a -- our backlog is still not maybe what it would have looked like proportionately 2 years ago before the pandemic, but the last 6 months or so, order intake definitely is.  In terms of the Life Science capital, there's a lot of money being spent expanding production in terms of biologics, vaccines, and gene therapies. All of these different type of applications that require aseptic manufacturing environments, and as we've discussed before, that's really STERIS's sweet spot. We tend to benefit on the consumables side of that, we tend to benefit in AST on the disposable side going into those manufacturing environments, and then we also tend to benefit on the Capital Equipment side for GMP type equipment for sterilization into those type of environments as well.  The other thing I would mention is we have seen, since the beginning of our fiscal year, recovery in research type spending, which was really slow during the pandemic. Much of that is state or federal funded public institutional spending. And that dried up pretty bad last year and we have seen a replacement business and what we would categorize more as lab or research come back, at least on an order input to what it would look like pre -- close to what it would look like pre -pandemic
Chris Cooley : I appreciate all the color and congrats on the quarter.
Dan Carestio : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham and Co. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'll start with the Dental business. I heard the 10% growth, so that's good to hear, but maybe talk about what you're seeing in that business. I think prior -- when Cantel was still separate, they were talking about seeing increased demand for infection prevention products because of the pandemic. Is that sustainable? And I think Cantel talked about this being a high single-digit growth business over time. Do you agree with that?
Dan Carestio : I think it's early days for us at this point to put out any long-term projections on Dental. Frankly, we're still learning the business. We like the performance year-to-date anyways with STERIS and we do believe the team over there is doing a really nice job managing the business and also the recovery coming out of the pandemic. So, at this point, we do believe there's connection in terms of the infection control value piece. To be able to quantify that to you at this time, I just don't think we're in a position to do that yet.
Mike Matson : Okay. No, that's fine. And then you're one of a handful of med-tech companies that has positive pricing. Is there any ability to maybe raise the prices a little more to offset some of the inflationary pressures, or even free surcharges or anything like that?
Dan Carestio : Yeah, I mean, what I would say is we're not a pure-play med-tech. If you think about it, we've got an awful lot of business that deals with medical manufacturing and also pharmaceutical manufacturing, and now actually dental as well, so -- and those have a little different structure around what can, can't be done in terms of pass cost [Indiscernible].  What we've consistently done historically at STERIS is try to pass -through enough to basically cover as much of inflation as we can. We are reasonable on whether the customers will accept it. And then we try to get the rest out of productivity gains within our manufacturing environments, which we've been pretty successful at over the years as well.
Mike Matson : Okay, thanks. And if I could just squeeze one more in on hospital capital spending. We've seen very -- it seems to be very strong capital spending in '21, much better than I would've expected. What are you hearing about calendar '22? Does it look like it's going to continue to be strong into '22 as well?
Dan Carestio : I do not see it changing in the foreseeable future based on what we've seen consistently in terms of work intake and also new projects that are still out there for opportunities for STERIS going forward.
Mike Matson : Great. Thanks
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Polark with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Polark : Hi. Good morning. I want to go back to Mike's comments on these material and labor costs, and I'm trying to understand what had previously been considered in guidance and what is incremental today that's limiting the guidance updates? I heard $5 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second quarter. You raised the earnings guidance after the first quarter.  Presumably that raise included the $5 million in the quarter and probably considered the number for 2Q. Is that fair? And what of that amount is incremental in the forecast today? Is it the full $20 million for 2H or is it a portion of that because you had a placeholder? Any color here on those numbers and how they relate to the progression of the forecast would be helpful.
Mike Tokich : Yeah. Certainly, Mike. As you're right, we did incur $5 million in Q1 and when we did increase guidance, we anticipated an additional $10 million for the remaining three quarters. We incurred 10 million in Q2, so that the 20 million plus is all incremental to our revised outlook at this point in time. Which is one of the reasons why we're holding our outlook steady compared to what we raised last quarter, and also compared to the -- how we exceeded the second quarter results. Hopefully that math ties out and makes sense to you.
Michael Polark : Yes, that's very helpful. And just to put a final fine point on it, back to the 5 million and the progression and the build of these numbers, this is all incremental to the initial outlook that you put out before the fiscal year, correct?
Mike Tokich : That is correct. Why?
Michael Polark : Yes. Okay. Just more broadly on supply chain, Dan you mentioned -- what are the raw materials that matter for STERIS most? And is this stuff for your consumables business, for your equipment production, both? Just curious for a bit more detailed color on what's -- what are the major items that you're watching and which businesses are potentially most impacted?
Dan Carestio : I mean, it's -- our concerns are across equipment and also consumables, especially on the chemistry side and that's somewhere that we're really watching to make sure that we always have adequate amount of precursor chemistry to continue to make our finished products. In terms of the other applications, whether it's components that go into manufacturing capital equipment, whether it's electronics or steel, or framing, or whatever, that's more of cost management at this point as opposed to timing, because we are seeing cost escalation there. But it's -- there -- trust me, there are issues across every aspect of manufacturing environments right now in light of delivery times and just general availability and things of that nature.
Michael Polark : If I can sneak one more in, I would appreciate an update on the EPA's progress on these potentially updated ethylene oxide emission standards, where we are in that rule making cycle? What milestones may be ahead here in the next 3 to 12 months, or at least your latest expectation on that? And then specifically, there was an update, I'm losing track of time, two to three weeks ago. EPA, I believe, sent letters to close to 30 EEO facilities in the U.S. asking for those facilities to report emissions data starting in '23. Historically, this was voluntary. STERIS had some facilities on that list, so I'd also be specifically curious for your feedback to that development. Thank you.
Dan Carestio : Yeah. Sure. This is Dan. So, what I would say is we are in close communication with the EPA on this issue, and we always fulfill any requests that they have from a regulatory perspective. So, we're working with them to make sure they have the appropriate data from STERIS. In addition, we are optimistic that we do see some sort of proposed roll sometime in the first calendar quarter. We had originally -- I personally had originally hoped for early January.  That's TBD, but hopefully we'll see something sooner than later out of the agency that gets us to a final path. And in the interim, we've made some significant investments ahead of any regulations in anticipation of any change where our facilities now are down to just tying up a few minor things in terms of what we think are enhanced improvements of head of any regulatory [Indiscernible] rule that might changes requirements to operate.
Michael Polark : Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen. This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Just wanted to take sec back to thank everybody for joining us. I know it's a busy earnings season time and we look forward to catching up with many of you offline.
Operator: This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-08-10 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the STERIS plc First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today’s event is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Julie Winter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma’am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. This morning, speaking on our call will be Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO and Dan Carestio, our President and CEO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS’ securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS’ SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today’s call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in today’s release as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie and good morning everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 21%. Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 130 basis points of price. Acquisitions in total added $141 million to revenue in the quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. To assist you with your modeling, I will share some color on the acquisition revenue contribution within the Healthcare segment. Of the approximately $96 million in acquired revenue, about 70% is consumable revenue from both Key Surgical and Cantel Medical. About 20% of the balance is capital equipment revenue with the last 10% being service revenue. We will not be breaking that down any further as it is already difficult to differentiate some product lines as we are integrating the businesses quickly and that challenge will only escalate as with each passing quarter. Gross margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points compared with the prior year to 46.6% as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were somewhat offset by negative foreign currency, inflation and mix. Looking at the rest of the year, we do expect additional headwinds from inflation on raw materials. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.9% of revenue, an increase of 130 basis points from the first quarter last year. As anticipated, we are starting to see some operating expenses such as travel and sales and marketing costs return, which limited EBIT margin growth. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.8%, higher than last year, but in line with our expectations for the fiscal year. Net income in the quarter increased to $159.9 million and earnings were $1.76 per diluted share. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter is lower than our expectations and is below 2.9x. We have less debt and higher EBITDA than we originally modeled. Cash at the end of the quarter totaled $535 million. Regarding the Cantel convertible notes, 100% of the holders have elected to convert their notes. All conversions will be fully settled in cash during the second quarter of fiscal ‘22. As of June 30, the estimated total cash settlement value was approximately $366.5 million. During the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $56.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $83.6 million. Capital spending in the first quarter was somewhat lower than planned due to weather-related delays for several of our AST construction projects. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $41.2 million. And as anticipated, this is a decline from the prior year due to cost associated with the Cantel Medical acquisition. With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks.
Dan Carestio: Thanks, Mike and thanks again to everyone for taking the time to join us today. We had a strong start to our fiscal year. Revenue growth in Q1 exceeded our expectations as we saw faster recovery in customer demand than planned, in particular in our Healthcare and AST segments. Due to strong volume growth, we were able to expand margins nicely during the quarter. Our integration teams have been hard at work and significant progress has been made integrating Cantel Medical. We are pleased with what we are seeing, but of course, we still have significant work to do. Since the June 2nd close and acquisition, we have made a number of decisions that impact how we go to market with our customer-first mentality. For example, leveraging the talent and expertise of the Cantel sales organization, we have created a dedicated sales channel focused solely on endoscope reprocessing. We added a new dental segment and mapped the Cantel businesses over to the four STERIS reporting segments. Executive alignment and leadership has been completely defined from both a field and back office perspective. We have started to educate and implement STERIS lean practices within Cantel and we have made significant progress realigning our European Healthcare business as we bring STERIS, Key Surgical and Cantel together. From a synergy perspective, we continue to expect a $25 million benefit for this fiscal year, as the majority of the savings are driven by the elimination of corporate cost and much of that integration is complete. In terms of longer term synergies, we are increasingly confident of exceeding our $110 million cost target as we continue to see opportunities to improve. Shifting to our outlook, based on what we have seen in STERIS and across the broader industry, we believe there has been a significantly faster rebound in procedures than we anticipated. This has created stronger demand for capital, consumables and services and has led us to raise – revise our guidance upward for the year. Starting with revenue, our constant currency organic growth outlook has been increased to 10% to 11% growth for fiscal 2022. This improvement, combined with additional foreign currency benefit and higher expectations for Cantel’s Medical business, has increased our expectation for total reported revenue to $4.6 billion. Our organic growth is driven by revenue recovery across business, but in particular, from our Healthcare and AST segments. Within the Healthcare segment, we have record capital backlog at the end of the first quarter with strength in both surgical and infection prevention. The record healthcare backlog is entirely organic as we have not yet added the Cantel Capital Equipment to our backlog. Consumables also had a strong start to the year as we have relatively easy comparisons and experienced some restocking by our customers. AST is also expected to remain strong as our core medical device customers are benefiting from the rebound procedures and rebuilding some inventory. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for COVID-related products and vaccines as well as bioprocess manufacturing disposables. Given the strength of AST, our segment allocation will shift from what we shared last quarter. AST is now expected to be approximately 18% of total company revenue, while Dental will be about 8% on of total company revenue for the full fiscal year. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share expectations to a range of $7.60 to $7.85 based on higher volume growth and improved margins. We are mindful that there is still considerable uncertainty around procedure volumes as we see COVID variance continuing to spread continued inflationary pressure and we also have an expectation that we will pick up some increases in OpEx in the second half of the year. Reflecting on the stronger projected earnings growth, free cash flow expectations have been increased by $20 million. Fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be another record year for STERIS. We look forward to continue to update all of you on our progress. I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A. Julie?
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Dan, for your comments. Jamie, would you please give the instructions and we will get started on Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan: Hey, good morning, guys. And thank you very much for taking the questions. Dan, first, can you just talk to the trends you’re seeing in the AST business? I mean it wasn’t a particularly easy comp this quarter and it seems like you’ve been able to sustain low double digit or even low teens growth rate in that business for a little bit. How should we be thinking about that going forward?
Dan Carestio: I mean what we’re seeing now is obviously driven by a rebound in procedures, especially the highly elective procedures which are generally the higher value type products that we process. So that’s where we’re seeing a lot of the improvement now. In the past, Matt, we saw the benefit of PPE and some of the COVID-related products when we saw declines in normal procedural type products. Going forward, assuming that things are resuming at normal levels of procedural occurrences and we don’t get slipped up significantly by another COVID variant in terms of procedural slowdown, we’re highly confident that we will continue to grow. And we believe that the COVID-related products are here to stay for the foreseeable future anyways. And then clearly, the work that we’re doing with bioprocessing disposables is long-term sustainable growth for us. So all in all, I think we’re reaping the benefits of a lot of investments we put in place over the last few years in terms of capacity expansion and able to fill those as customers’ demand continues to tick up.
Matthew Mishan: And then two questions on the model, first, the corporate cost line came in at a higher number, around like $75 million. Is that the normalized rate moving forward for that line? And then secondly, I think you previously gave a first half, second half phasing for EPS. Is that still intact or has that changed?
Mike Tokich: Good morning, Matt, it’s Mike. In regards to the phasing, the percentages, we came out with 45-55 split for the year on our last call. It’s moved 1% or 2%. So it’s not material in our view. So we have not updated that. But it’s moving a little bit more towards, obviously, the second half, but again, 100 basis part or 200 basis points, nothing material from our standpoint. Corporate costs, obviously, we have seen travel and we have seen some return of additional costs. So I would say $75 million may be a little high, but think about obviously a larger increase as we go on. And usually, the first quarter is a little bit higher for us as we are providing for bonuses for the year at the start. Obviously, there are some commissions also in there. But I would say, relatively, you’re definitely going to see an increase in the operating expenses. If everything is assumed without, as Dan talked about, without seeing any additional variance, we have seen travel pickup for our field and for our corporate staff.
Matthew Mishan: Okay, excellent. And then last, just a bigger picture question. Dan, as you’re coming out of this, what’s the right way to look at the long-term growth CAGR for STERIS?
Mike Tokich: I mean, Matt, it’s difficult right now is what I would say, coming out of a post-COVID year in the sort of phasing where we’re still in COVID, but we’re not. So our overarching goals at STERIS is to deliver in the high single digits and the low double digits on bottom consistently as a company. I think we probably are getting a little lift this past quarter from a faster procedural recovery than we anticipated, but that’s our forward-looking statement that we’ve had consistently in terms of our objectives for growth.
Matthew Mishan: Alright. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Mike Matson: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the – I guess, I will start with the dental business. So, just curious how that – how you are viewing that business? I don’t know if you can tell us sort of a pro forma growth or not, but what do you think of the business now that you own it, given it’s a new market for you? And then I noticed that you kind of raised the AST portion of the mix and lowered the portion of the dental mix. So, is that dental underperforming or is AST just outperforming?
Dan Carestio: Yes. It’s not dental underperforming. They are right on target in terms of what our expectations were in our deal model. AST just is running a little hot right now is what I would say.
Mike Tokich: And Mike, to give you some context, Dental, I mean, we just had it for 28 days. But it is – as Dan said, it is performing in line with our expectations. And if you look year-over-year, they have about a 30% revenue growth. So obviously, doing very nicely as they are seeing the dental market and the procedures on the dental customers coming back nicely as we have seen on the healthcare side.
Mike Matson: Okay. Thanks. And then the gross margin was quite a bit above what we have been modeling. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on that. Do you expect it to kind of stay at this 46.5% level going forward?
Dan Carestio: Yes, Mike, I would say that it’s probably a high watermark for us right now. We had a lot of things from a favorable standpoint happen during the quarter, and those are going to be hard to repeat. And I think one of the things that we want to make sure we come across with is we continue to expect higher inflation as we go out and hire material costs. So, that will put some – definitely put some pressure on those margins. So, I would say it’s a little bit lower than that. 46.6% is probably, again, a high watermark for us.
Mike Matson: Okay, understand. And then you mentioned inflation, but I want to ask just about kind of component availability, semiconductors, things like that? I mean, are you seeing any issues there that could constrain your ability to meet demand at all?
Dan Carestio: We are seeing issues, but nothing that’s constraining in terms of our ability to deliver for customers. There are certain instances where maybe we are paying a little more than what we paid historically. But generally speaking, we have been managing through it pretty well at this point.
Mike Matson: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Polark: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. For starters, curious on the development of the equipment backlog, healthcare and life sciences, I continue to be impressed by the resilience and strength in that line for you and some other companies that I follow. So, is this simply reopening procedure recovery in company and customers are replacing end of service equipment and adding capacity or is there something else going on, on the capital side that you think is contributing to the ongoing strength there in some of those numbers?
Dan Carestio: Yes. As you know, our biggest concern probably this time last year when we spoke was what was going to happen with capital spending. And it actually recovered much quicker than we thought. And we were building backlog all through the second half of the year. What we are seeing now is just – there seems to be a lot of spending, both in healthcare, and we are seeing some of the replacement business in the research market and the healthcare also coming back at this point. So, the hospital systems just seem a little more bullish in terms of long-term growth expectations. And so we are well positioned to accommodate those expansions, both in SPD and also in the surgical suites.
Michael Polark: Are there any new products that you have – that you are rolling out that are kind of helping there or regular way type of – yes, any color on that?
Dan Carestio: I would rather say we have a steady diet of sort of iterative new products that we continue to roll out. Our R&D teams have done a really great job over the last 4 years or 5 years in making sure that we are able to be well positioned with new features, new benefits on core products around washing and steam and hydrogen peroxide and now with Medivators around AERs as well. So, there is nothing that’s revolutionary in terms of new type applications, but like I said, a steady diet of iterative new product development that’s coming to market.
Michael Polark: The comment on weather-related delays to some of your capital projects in AST, can you just provide a little more color what type of weather and where? And then is a slippage of a quarter meaningful in the grand scheme? I think these capacity expansions or new facilities tend to be multiyear build cycles. So, just – is this something that normalizes over the course of the back half of the year is really the question?
Dan Carestio: It does. What I would say is it’s been during COVID, and it’s – this is universally applied across the globe. It is very difficult to build major projects. Buildings, let alone complex engineered structures and, getting resources, getting the skilled labor across borders to be in the right place at the right time, weather delays are all factors that can slowdown the process. Having said that, our teams are – we are building a number of facilities right now, and our teams are working aggressively to compensate. But we are optimistic that although a little later than anticipated or originally planned, we are in a pretty good spot in terms of our ability to bring them up successfully and in the right time.
Michael Polark: The last one, probably for Mike, the leverage metric, you quoted, Mike, 2.9x, is that pro forma for Cantel kind of on a 12-month basis? Just what’s the numerator-denominator in light of the acquisition to get to that number?
Mike Tokich: Yes, certainly. So, it does include Cantel. And so one of the – as part of the calculation, we do have the ability to include the prior 12 months of Cantel’s EBITDA. And obviously, Cantel performed much better over the last two quarters than we anticipated in our model. So, that’s one factor of why leverage is lower. The other factor is Cantel actually was able to pay-down their debt much more quickly, and it was lower than we anticipated at close. And in addition to that, they actually had a higher cash balance than we anticipated. So, that also was a factor in allowing us to continue to pay-down, but more importantly, borrow less debt as the transaction closed. So, those are the two main factors.
Michael Polark: Yes. Alright, thank you very much.
Mike Tokich: You’re welcome.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will end today’s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to the management team for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. I know many of you are on vacation. I appreciate you dialing in, and we look forward to catching up with you in the coming weeks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today’s conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-05-19 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the STERIS plc Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Speaking on today's call we have Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Dan Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the express written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The Company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the Company and on our Web site. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency, organic revenue and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures including definition is available on today's release. This also includes reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures represented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning everyone. It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 0.3% as favorable pricing was somewhat offset by organic volume, which was slightly lower than last year's strong pre-COVID performance. Key Surgical added $32 million to revenue in the quarter, which is somewhat lower than we originally anticipated due to continued disruption of COVID-19. You will notice that we have a small acquisition called out within AST. In January, we completed the acquisition of one of our suppliers. While this is a vertical integration, we do expect revenue generation of approximately $25 million annually. Gross margin for the quarter was flat with the prior year, at 44.3%, as favorable pricing and cost management were offset by mix and currency. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.3% of revenue, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25% and 20.7% for the full fiscal year. Higher than last year and higher than our expectations due to income mix from higher tax rate countries and discreet item adjustments including stock compensation. As we noted in the release this morning, we have discontinued the use of LIFO. We believe that the FIFO method of accounting is preferable because it more closely resembles the physical flow of our inventory, aligns how we manage the business, and improves comparability to other companies. Net income in the quarter was flat, at $140.3 million, and earnings per share were $1.63. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter is below 1.9 times as we continue to pay down debt post the Key Surgical acquisition. Considering our cash position of $220 million, access to available credit lines, and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. Following the close of Cantel Medical, we expect our leverage ratio to be about three times as we take advantage of the financing arrangements already put in place, including our first ever public debt offering. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $74.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $59 million. Free cash flow for fiscal '21 was strong at $450.9 million, an increase of approximately $70 million over last year primarily due to working capital improvements somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Mike has already discussed the quarter, so I will focus on the full-year, and then turn the call to Dan to discuss our outlook for fiscal '22. Looking back on FY '21, STERIS fared better than our most positive expectations at the beginning of this unprecedented time in our history. The commitment of our people and the resilience of our businesses allowed us to weather this storm in a positive manner. Remarkably, our revenue was up somewhat in fiscal 2021 as our existing business was stable in total, while we completed acquisitions that added to our growth for the year. Our net income and free cash flow both improved double digits as we managed costs and working capital across the business. From a segment perspective, our Life Sciences business had another very strong year, growing constant currency organic revenue 11% as our biopharma customers used our consumable and ordered a record amount of capital equipment. Our AST segment also had a very good year, ending up 7% on a constant currency organic revenue basis despite a slow start due to the global decline in healthcare procedure volumes. While global procedures are not yet back to pre-COVID levels, AST was able the grow as the year progressed because our previous capacity expansions allowed us to process single-use products related to COVID treatment, testing, and vaccine production. As procedures volumes began to recovery in the second-half and core medical device customers increased manufacturing, AST has returned to more historic growth rates. Our Healthcare business was clearly the most impacted by the pandemic and the related decline in procedure volumes, with constant currency organic revenue down 4% for the year. By the end of the fiscal year, our consumables were trending up nicely in line with procedures, and capital equipment orders were very strong, leading to a record year-end backlog of over $200 million. Our R&D teams have done a great job updating our offerings across our Healthcare business the past year or so. With the addition of Key Surgical and Cantel products and services, along with STERIS' portfolio, we will be better positioned than ever to meet the needs of our customers going forward. The strength of our balance sheet allowed us to operate almost normally last year, increasing our dividend, investing in R&D and capital spending opportunities in all our current businesses, not laying off any of our people for COVID-related volume reductions, completing the acquisition of Key Surgical, in November, and executing the merger agreement with Cantel Medical. We believe these long-term-oriented actions will propel future revenue and profitability growth across our business. In support of the Cantel transaction, our people achieved another significant milestone when we completed our first public debt offering. This was after securing investment-grade rating on our maiden voyage with all three rating agencies. Once the Cantel deal closes, and that debt is on our books, we are committed to reducing our leverage to continue to justify those strong ratings. We expect the strength of our balance sheet to remain a hallmark of our company going forward. All in all, considering the additional issues required by the pandemic, a tremendous set of achievements for STERIS this past year. As you might expect, this is my final STERIS earnings call. As I shift to my new role as an Advisor to Management and the Board, I am very pleased to hand the reins to Dan Carestio, who will succeed me as President and CEO. Dan is a veteran senior executive of our company, having spent more than two decades his terrace with increasing responsible leadership roles. He knows the business. He is fortunate to be supported by an outstanding senior management team, most of whom have also been with our company for a decade or more of success. I am confident that our company is in very good hands with Dan and this STERIS leadership team. I want to take a moment also to recognize our analysts. Several of you have been with us for many years; Chris for 12, Larry for nine, Dave and Matt seven years each. Mike and Mike have picked up coverage fairly recently. And we certainly value their addition. We appreciate all of your efforts on behalf of your clients and our long-term shareholders. And it's been my absolute pleasure to work with each of you this past decade or so. In closing, I would like to thank the people of STERIS for making our company what it is today. And better yet, what it will be tomorrow. The 13,000 people working every day in pursuit of our mission, soon to be over 16,000 are what make the company tick. I also greatly appreciate our Board members the last 14 years. I've been blessed to work with, and for the talented and diverse Board, and two wonderful Chairman, Jack Wareham and now Mohsen Sohi. This Board's guidance will continue to help Dan and the team move ever forward. And I'm tremendously grateful to all of our long-term shareholders who have believed in the value our company provides to our customers, our people, and our shareholders. It's been my honor and pleasure to serve as CEO of this great company for nearly 14 years. And I look forward to its continued successes. I am absolutely confident that the best is yet to come. As you will hear next from, Dan, while reviewing our outlook. Mr. Carestio.
Dan Carestio: Thanks, Walt. I want to echo Walt and Mike's welcome to all of you. We really appreciate you taking the time to join us today. As Walt discussed, STERIS had a great year in fiscal 2021, all things considered. And we remain very excited about what is yet to come. Not only do we expect a nice rebound in our base business in fiscal 2022. But we look forward to bringing together three great companies STERIS, Key Surgical and soon Cantel. That does, however, make modeling the STERIS a bit more difficult for all of you. So I will focus my comments today on our overall outlook, and then walk you through our expectations for the new fiscal year. Including acquisitions, we expect total revenue of approximately $4.5 billion. That assumes 10 months of inorganic revenue from Cantel. The remaining seven months of Key Surgical before anniversaries, along with smaller AST supplier as inorganic contributors. It also assumes about $15 million favorability from foreign currency. Underlying net growth will be constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% for legacy STERIS. That growth rate will be driven by significant rebound in our healthcare segment, the ongoing success of AST. And while with a normal growth versus comparisons to fiscal 2021 very strong performance for the Life Sciences segment. Before moving on to profitability, I wanted to take a moment to discuss the upcoming changes to our segments following the completion of the Cantel acquisition. Today Cantel has four major businesses, Medical, Dental, Life Sciences and Dialysis. Medical and dialysis will become part of STERIS' healthcare segment. As we have said previously, we anticipate that dental will be its own segment. To more closely in line with STERIS' customers we will split Cantel's Life Sciences business with the renal business about 85% of their revenue going to our healthcare segment and the balance going to our life science segment. From a total revenue split perspective, the net impact of all these moves will leave us with the following segment breakdown; Healthcare, 63% of revenue; AST, 17% of revenue; Life Sciences, 11% of revenue; and Dental 9% of revenue. Operating margins are expected to improve, but they will be tempered a bit as we expect operating expenses such as travel and sales and marketing to come back closer to normal in particular in the second-half of the year. We continue to believe that the cost synergies of $110 million are achievable for Cantel with about 50% of that total recognized in the first 24 months. Our fiscal 2022 outlook includes approximately $25 million of these cost synergies. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are anticipated to be in the range $7.40 to $7.65 which assumes an adjusted effective tax rate of 21 to 22% and a share count of approximately $99 million diluted shares. This share count assumes that Cantel's convertible notes are converted and settled in cash. We would expect stronger revenue in the second-half of our fiscal year with earnings in line with our traditional 45/55 split. From a balance sheet perspective, as Mike discussed our leverage will initially be a bit higher than normal for STERIS following the close of Cantel. We are committed to debt repayment as a priority over the next couple of years and would expect to be back closer to our normal sweet spot in the mid 2s within that timeframe. As STERIS continues to invest in AST facility expansions and outsourced reprocessing centers and assuming about $50 million of CapEx for Cantel, our total capital spending is anticipated to be approximately $320 million in fiscal 2022. Free cash flow will be impacted by the integration and deal-related cost of approximately $200 million. And in total is anticipated to be approximately $380 million. You'll recall that we do not adjust free cash flow for deal integration cost. Other than focusing on repaying debt, our capital spending priorities will be the same; dividend, investing in our current businesses, tuck-in M&A, and share buybacks. We are confident we have the cash generation capacity to invest appropriately in our growth priorities and reduce our debt in the coming years. I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to thank Walt today. Walt has been a mentor to be and the rest of the STERIS' leadership team for many years. And, I would not be prepared to step into the CEO role without his support and counsel over these past years. Thank you, Walt for everything you have done to get STERIS where we are today. A great company consistently improving to meet the needs that are evolving for our customers, staffed by associates who have safe and rewarding work, and generating above market returns for our investors as they have come to expect. With that, I would turn call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A. Julie?
Julie Winter: Thanks everyone for comments. Jamie, if you could just give the instructions, we can get into Q&A.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Turkaly: Great, thanks. And Walt, we will certainly miss you. Time does fly. Done a great run though. Maybe I could just start with the guidance, the assumption. I know when you bought Cantel, you gave us a backwards look at EBIT contribution, but obviously that was a kind of a year that had some special impact. So, I was wondering if you might just talk a little bit about what that contribution you think that will be? Now, obviously, the guide, looks like there's some accretion in there from Cantel, and I'm just curious if you might want to share some of the details around specifically that contribution?
Mike Tokich: Yes, Dave, this is Mike. So, obviously, if you look at our guidance, including Cantel, from an EBIT contribution standpoint they'll have similar EBIT margins that legacy STERIS has, and that EBIT margin dollars will be right around $230 million-$240 million contribution for the 10 months of fiscal year '22.
Dave Turkaly: Got it. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned the debt. Congrats on the offering. Could you just tell us sort of, I guess, the interest assumptions, maybe there for the year, I imagine you may pay some down as you go along. But maybe sort of the aggregate amount of debt and sort of the interest expense you expect to incur? Thanks a lot.
Mike Tokich: Yes, certainly. So, we did -- as Walt and I both mentioned, we did do our first public debt offering for $1.35 billion. We did two tranches, a 10-year and a 30-year, split equally, so about $675 million each. That debt combined is about 3.225%, and then, obviously, the rest of the debt that we have will be between our private placements, term loans, and whatever we draw on our evolving credit facility. So what we are projecting is, all in, from a rate standpoint about 2.5% for the year, and just under $4 billion when we start with Cantel and we close Cantel, and then obviously we anticipate paying some of that down throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. And as Dan and I both mentioned, we have the mindset to get back into the low-to-mid twos some time within the next few years.
Dave Turkaly: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan: Great, thank you for taking the questions. Walt, we will definitely miss you, and always appreciated your candor and insight. Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the modeling questions, are you still planning to bucket Healthcare and Life Sciences with capital equipment consumables and service? And then as far as interest expense tax and share count, could you kind of break out the 1Q '21 or the first quarter contribution versus the full-year given the mid-quarter close?
Mike Tokich: Yes, so first of all, to answer your question about the segments, Matt. We are going to continue to report capital consumables and services or service for both Healthcare and Life Sciences, and obviously services for just AST as we typically have done. The one factor that we are looking at is dental, is how to break that out. We know it's going to be a separate segment. We've got a little bit of work to do in order to figure out what particular breakout we want to go down there. They do have a lot of instruments, especially around the Hu-Friedy standpoint, so more to come on that. And then, Matt, I don't think we're going to get into that level of detail on the quarterly breakouts. We're about 99 million shares for the year. Obviously, Cantel is adding almost 15 million of those when we close. So, that's about as much detail as I think we're going to give at this point.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then just a question around Key Surgical, I think you had previously thought that the pluses and the minuses can even themselves out in that business from the disruption from COVID-19. Has anything kind of changed there? And for next year, does that grow in line with the company on an organic basis for Key Surgical?
Dan Carestio: Yes, this is Dan, Matt. So, what I would say is the long-term view of Key is still incredibly positive. And they are highly procedurally driven. And if you recall when we've spoken before, they have much more opportunity in Europe, but they also, complimentary, have much more exposure in terms of COVID. And COVID had a much more significant affect in the winter months in Europe than what we had initially anticipated. Now, as we continue to see recovery, both in the U.S. or North American market and the European markets, we're seeing the positive trends of Key, and we're confident it will come back to track with STERIS' normal procedure rate-drive type businesses.
Matthew Mishan: And then big picture, you've seen a couple of your competitors across your businesses go public in previously more under-the-radar areas. Does that change the competitive landscape for you or is it a validation of the opportunity in those areas?
Dan Carestio: It doesn't change anything in terms of competitive landscape, I would say.
Matthew Mishan: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Mike Matson: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and Walt, congrats on the retirement. I know I've only covered the company about a year or so but enjoyed interacting with you over that time and learning about the company, so thanks. So, I guess first, I tried to back into kind of what the guidance is implying for Cantel revenue. On an annualized basis it seems like it's around $1.1 billion. Again, that's for the full year. I know you're not going to have it in your numbers for the full year, but that's a little bit below. I think we're modeling around -- we were modeling around $1.2 billion. So -- and it also sort of implies a flat growth from the prior sort of 12-month period. Is that right, and why aren't you assuming better growth there if it is right?
Dan Carestio: It is right, that's what we're modeling now. Cantel was a beneficiary of a lot of PPE sales, and especially in the late summer-early fall months of this year, and those were obviously pandemic-driven and likely not to stick around. So, we've appropriately removed any assumptions on high or continued sustained levels of PPE in the go-forward model.
Walt Rosebrough: And relative to STERIS, they are even more heavily procedurally driven and particularly elective procedures. And dental is largely an elective procedure space, and as a result probably a little slower to come back in our thinking. But again, as Dan has mentioned on Key, we don't see any difference the long-term of that. And it's very much like our modeling that we put in place when we did the deal.
Mike Matson: Okay, thanks. And then just on the transition from LIFO to FIFO is there any kind of financial impact from that to EPS or cash flow or anything?
Mike Tokich: Yes, Mike, there is but it's not material at all. And going forward, LIFO has become a very small percentage of our inventory pool. So, we will -- actually we did restate the quarters looking back, we will do the same thing and give more detail in the 10-K when we file it at the end of this month. But nothing material that I would say is going to change directionally the company or the outlook for the company.
Walt Rosebrough: And I think Mike mentioned it was $0.03 this past year. That gives you an order of magnitude; it's not a big deal.
Mike Matson: Okay, got it. Sorry, I missed that. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens Inc. Please go [technical difficulty] -- 
Chris Cooley: Can you hear me now?
Mike Tokich: Yes.
Chris Cooley: I'm sorry. Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And Walter, just want to say it's been a true pleasure to work with you these 12 years, your accomplishments here have been tremendous and I wish you all the best going forward. Julie, and Mike and Daniel are stuck with me; let's go for 13.
Walt Rosebrough: All right.
Chris Cooley: Yes. My questions here this morning, if you may, I want to first start on the cash flow guide for the full-year. It's impressive. When we look at the $380 million, obviously inclusive of $200 million in charges if we make -- connect that adjustment you're looking at roughly 13% of the reported revenue guide. But when I think about that, help me kind of unpack what the underlying assumptions are when we think about the margin structure, because in this most recent quarter, on the core STERIS side, obviously you had a record operating margin contribution from AST, Life Science tapered a little with the consumables coming down. Just want to try and make sure I'm understanding kind of what the underlying assumptions are there on getting to that $380 million for the full year. Then I had a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Mike Tokich: Yes, certainly. Obviously, the deal-related and the integration cost, that $200 million we're anticipating off of free cash flow, we are once again increasing our CapEx pretty substantially both not only on the STERIS side in particular for AST facility expansions, but also continued operating room or ORC expansions, reprocessing expansions within particularly North America. And then we do have about $50 million of CapEx identified specifically for Cantel Medical. But one of the things that we continue to see and Dan talked about it a little bit is on the net income standpoint, we are anticipating that both travel sales and marketing will be up significantly year-over-year. In addition continued R&D spend will also increase, so that's definitely going to have an impact not only on the net income side, but also on the free cash flow standpoint. And then the other thing, we've done a really nice job on this year is improving, and driving improvements in working capital. And we continue to think that we can do that, and then obviously I think there is some opportunity longer term with Cantel on a standalone basis to drive that, but that's going to take us a little bit of time as we integrate the companies to get those benefits Chris.
Walt Rosebrough: One other comment too, and that is, we built an awful lot of inventory this year, and just for our fears around supply chain assurity and things like that. And we're still sitting on an awful lot of that inventory. And as we are optimistic that supply chains will get better in the next six months, we'll probably go back to our moral leaner mindset in terms of inventory management, but in an abundance of caution not to stock out for our customers, we've been running a little heavier than normal.
Chris Cooley: Make sense. And I appreciate all the color there. And then just lastly for me, when I think about just maybe bigger picture looking at the integration going forward, obviously willing in key surgical and about to close here on the Cantel acquisition. When we look at the guide, there seems to be some changes versus the last kind of major acquisition the company did. And I'm thinking back to synergy, when we think about the related contribution from growth, and similarly from margin, help me just think a little bit though about kind of how you're approaching this kind of where you see the kind of key milestones. And also I think it's getting -- maybe getting lost a little bit here this morning, that he did step up the core STERIS organic guide versus kind of what we've historically seen here, help us kind of think about again what you see there and implicit in the guide, and what's a little bit different this time when you're doing integration versus synergy. And I realize they're different businesses, but just trying to think a little bit about where the challenges lie, and where you had that had competence? Thanks so much, and again, Walt, all the best.
Dan Carestio: Yes, Chris, what would I say is it's a very different synergy was more of a complimentary revenue play opportunity with a little bit of cost out, because they were largely present in Europe where we had less presence, and there wasn't much overlap between the two. In the case of Cantel, there is significant cost out opportunity. That's why we identified the $110 million target that we're going after. And a lot of that is in some of the leadership compensation and sort of where we have redundancy amongst executives and folks within the organization. So, we're actively working on day one now if you will, all the messaging, all the mapping of who's reporting to who and getting the structures aligned and working with the Cantel teams to get there. So that's the difference between the two deals in terms of where we are. And we do believe there's probably going to be some revenue synergies out of the complimentary portfolio offering, but clearly we're focused on the cost out piece early on. In terms of the other question I think around the margins, we do believe as procedures come back to normal that will continue to drive growth in our AST business and in our reoccurring revenue consumables businesses, especially in the healthcare segment, which tend to be higher margin consumable type annuity businesses. And we do think that as we get back to pre-COVID levels in the back half of our fiscal year, we'll see a significant benefit from that in our overall margin structure.
Walt Rosebrough: Chris, I would add just a comment on that, the same thing Dan talked about, this being a much more cost out type of a deal. First of all, we're fortunate in that. I mean fortunate in kind of an odd way, COVID caused both of us to put hiring freezes across much of the company. And so a big piece of those cost synergies are going to be handled by not hiring people that one or both of us would have hired because we have people from the two companies. So, a piece of this will go easier than normal. We haven't built that into our model in terms of the cost of synergies, we've included our -- what I call normal cost of synergies, we could get a break on that, depending on how that works out. Unfortunately, people have to be in the right place, at the right time in their career and all those things. But I think that the real opportunity for us and we're quite good about using people and not laying people off just to hire somebody else. And so I think that's a real positive. And then the second component is, if you look at our history, we eventually get our revenue synergies, we always get our -- got synergies. And so, if I were a betting person, Mr. Carestio and Mr. Tokich has been able to get $110 million, I'd take the bet all day long, for as bigger bet you want to make.
Q – Chris Cooley: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Polark: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I have a couple, will follow the synergy thread there, I'm curious, the $200 million of deal and integration related expenses this year, can you help frame the potential tail to that into the next fiscal year and within the $200 million, what portion of that do you consider truly, one-time and deal related consulting legal transaction expenses, and what portion of that as investment you're making to capture the guided cost synergies?
Mike Tokich: Yes, Mike. So I mean, I would say that our math, they're fairly equal $100 million to obtain cost synergies, and then $100 million for the cost of the deal related obviously, the Attorney's fees, the bankers fees, the accountants fees, the banks themselves going through everything we've done from a financing standpoint, so those are about equal, the bulk of the deal costs should be done, obviously this fiscal year would be our guess. And we'll have a little bit of a tail as we continue to gain some synergies, cost synergies, we'll have to pay for that. Remember, our mindset was, when we did the announcement and our assumptions were in order to obtain that $110 million of cost synergies, it was going to cost us about one for one, from a cost standpoint to attain those synergies, so that's what that $200 million represents.
Michael Polark: Got it. Just scribbling down notes here.
Mike Tokich: That's fine.
Michael Polark: Yes, thank you for that, Mike. On the comment on ORC influence on the CapEx step-up caught my ear, I know it's a small piece of the business, don't hear a ton about it. But I'd imagine you're not putting dollars into the ground and hoping customers come, so are there wins there to talk about that are driving the CapEx comment for ORCs?
Dan Carestio: This is Dan. Michael, I would say they're not. They're not material in terms of the broader picture of STERIS. But it does cost some capital, similar to an AST type location and that there is a start-up ramp-up period where it may be initially a bit dilutive until the volume grows. But we build those not on speculation, but on relationship and contracts with our customers. And we're very confident that when we're putting brick and mortar in the ground that we're in a market with committed contracts and customers.
Michael Polark: Yes, three more quick ones, I promise the AST supplier, acquisition supplier of what?
Dan Carestio: They make our e-beam, X-ray equipment, and conveyance systems and control systems for the non-isotope radiation.
Michael Polark: Helpful. What's the latest thinking on the vaccine as a catalyst in life sciences, the equipment number was quite strong in the quarter, I continue to over model the consumables piece and so as we sit here with the U.S. vaccination progress demonstrable mid-May, World's  catching-up or ex-U.S. is catching-up like what's the vibe there, what's your view on the near-term sequential direction of some of those numbers within life sciences?
Dan Carestio: Yes, I go back to what we've talked about in the past and we got a lift on COVID in life sciences, consumables, but much of it was pre-buying from our customers. It wasn't necessarily attributed to COVID, COVID vaccine demand, there were some, I mean we did get some tailwinds from it, but really it was the buy ahead on products that weren't necessarily relative to COVID vaccine manufacturing. Now, we do think that it did have some positive impact on our capital equipment business. And we saw a number of units sold into Asia in particular that were specifically for vaccine type start-up facilities that they were putting up quickly. Yes, long-term, it's not a negative, I can tell you that. But since you're not going to see, I would assume that we've hit the plateau off the peak and we'll modestly grow from there as opposed to continuing to grow off of the trajectory that we expected to see as it relates specifically to COVID vaccines.
Michael Polark: Yes.
Mike Tokich: And with dense modestly grow, it is our fastest growing business, modestly grow as it relates to being a life science business that does consumables.
Michael Polark: Last one, I promise probably for Mike. So, a couple of questions on the debt and interest expense, so appreciate the comments so far. My question is really narrow for the June quarter, I think you put this debt in place at the very beginning of this quarter, correct me if I'm wrong, I'll call it April 1 give or take I was looking through the prior press releases. For the reporting of adjusted EPS, are you going to exclude the interest expense related to the financing until the Cantel deal closes or would we expect a full-quarter of interest expense in this June quarter?
Mike Tokich: Michael, you're right, we did put that financing in place in April. So that is in FY '22 and we'll not be adjusting any of that out. Obviously, it's a two month overhang, if you will, for putting that in place. So you should expect a full-year of the higher interest expense for the Cantel acquisition.
Michael Polark: All right, thank you very much.
Mike Tokich: You're welcome.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no additional questions, I'd like to turn the floor back over to the management team for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks, Jamie, and thanks everybody for taking the time to join us. I look forward to catching up with many of you in the coming days.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-02-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the STERIS plc Third Quarter FY 2021 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie and good morning, everyone. As usual, on today's call we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the express written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The Company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the Company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency, organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures including definition is available on today's release as well as reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures represented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. For discussions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 1.4% driven by 130 basis points of favorable price and 10 basis points of organic volume growth. Gross margin for the quarter was up 110 basis points to 44.2% and benefited from productivity, price and acquisitions. EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.6% of revenue, an increase of 250 basis points from the third quarter last year, due primarily to higher gross margin attainment and lower operating expenses for travel, sales and marketing, and compensation due in part from the business disruption from COVID-19. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.4%, somewhat lower than anticipated due to favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 20% to $149.2 million and earnings increased to $1.73 per diluted share as compared to $1.45 per diluted share in the prior year. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the Company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter is once again a below 2 times as we continue to pay down debt post the key surgical acquisition. Considering our cash position of $253 million, access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $53.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $56.8 million. Free cash flow for the first nine months was strong at $337.7 million, an increase of almost $100 million over the same period last year, primarily due to improvements in net income and working capital, somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you to discuss our third quarter results, which once again demonstrate the resilience of our business and the great work of our associates to serve the needs of our customers. Once again, we want to acknowledge the caregivers around the globe who are on the front lines of this pandemic and doing such a tremendous job. Looking back at the first three quarters of this fiscal year, the sequential improvement of our business is impressive. While we continue to experience the challenges of a global pandemic, the worst impact on our business appears to be in the rear view mirror. Despite significant numbers of new COVID-19 cases and some hospitals around the globe close to or add capacity procedures continue to occur. Our most significant concern, healthcare capital equipment achieved a critical milestone, showing three straight quarters of sequential improvement and ending the third quarter with an all-time record order month. This resulted in near record backlog, which is greater than that before the pandemic at the end of Q3 last year. Even with pockets of slowdowns in procedures due to COVID-19 uptick, we are quite pleased with our position at this point of our fiscal year. Constant currency organic revenue grew 1% in our third quarter driven by double-digit growth in AST which was offset by flat to slightly down revenue in life sciences and healthcare on a constant currency organic basis. Our strong growth in AST continues to be favorably impacted by demand for COVID-related single-use products such as PPE and COVID-testing materials as well as components used in vaccine manufacturing and packaging. The business has also seen steady demand from its core medical device customers. Life science revenue was flat in the quarter with mid-single-digit growth in consumables and services offset by a decline in capital equipment shipments. On the consumable side, we have been anticipating a return to more normalized growth for some time. It appears our customers are destocking the excess inventory that was built up over the last three quarters. With COVID vaccines now in production, we expect to see sustained high demand for our consumables offering, but not at the extraordinary growth rate of recent quarters on our pharma customers build inventory due to certain supply concern for vaccine production. And as we have commented frequently, over the years, capital equipment shipments in life science can be lumpy. The decline in Q3 was strictly a matter of timing as capital equipment orders were strong in the quarter reflected in our life sciences record capital equipment order backlog. Healthcare benefited from the addition of key surgical during the quarter, which added about $15 million to healthcare consumable revenue. While it's still early days, we are quite pleased with our integration efforts and what we're seeing so far in that business. We continue to have high expectations for key surgical going forward. As I mentioned earlier, while the shipments for healthcare capital equipment declined year-over-year for the quarter, we did see sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 and backlog ended above last year's levels. We are cautiously optimistic about our fourth quarter and start of our new fiscal year regarding healthcare capital equipment as the risks appear to have declined throughout this fiscal year. Our profit overall has exceeded our expectations as we continue to see the benefit of continued efficiency gains along with lower operating expenses. The operating expense reduction is largely due to travel disruptions from the pandemic. As we've said all year, we do expect some of those expenses to phase back in as travel resumes, returning our operating expenses to more normal levels. We are committed however to evaluating opportunities to permanently reduce expenses as we have learned that some things can be accomplished virtually. Adjusted earnings for the quarter as Mike mentioned were $1.73 per diluted share or growth of 19% as we benefited from higher gross margins, reduced operating expenses and a slightly lower than anticipated tax rate. With just two months remaining in our fiscal year, we like where we stand today and the long-term positioning of our global portfolio. Our thoughts on the full fiscal year have not changed materially from what we discussed last quarter. Constant currency organic revenue excluding acquisitions should be about flat for the fiscal year. That's impressive performance in this environment. But it is safe to say that we all look forward to getting back to normal and delivering the revenue growth we know we are capable of in the longer term. Once again, I would like to thank STERIS' people for their commitment to our customers, those healthcare professionals who continue to do a simply miraculous job on the front lines of this pandemic. We also welcome the people of key surgical to our team. And we're working through the process to complete the acquisition of Cantel Medical and look forward to welcoming the Cantel people to the STERIS family as well. Now, before we open to Q&A, I want to comment on our announcements that I will be stepping down as CEO at the end of July. The Board and I have been working on my succession for years. And while we have other capable candidates, Dan Carestio, our current Chief Operating Officer is our unanimous choice. And the Board and I have been working to prepare him for this transition. And as the announcement said, I will be available through July of 2023 as an advisor to management and the Board. As you all know, I hold a significant amount of STERIS' stock and options and continue to be highly vested in our long-term success, both personally and financially. When I came to STERIS a little over 13 years ago, the preponderance of investors and analysts advise me to exit the life science and AST business due to their moribund performance. I worked with the executives of those groups to determine whether not that was the way to go. The answer is now abundantly clear and we have Dan and his teams to thank for the improvements in those segments. Dan's early executive leadership role was running sales and marketing for the AST Group. He developed and implemented the strategy to improve that business. A few years later I asked him to take on life sciences as a General Manager, while maintaining the sales and marketing leadership for AST. He worked with that team and led the improvement in life sciences, while continuing the success at AST. He then successfully integrated Synergy Health AST business as General Manager of AST and Life Sciences. Dan took on the leadership of our Healthcare IPT business several years ago, making him responsible then for all sterilization and disinfection products across the STERIS portfolio. And finally, he became responsible for all of our operations as Chief Operating Officer in 2018. STERIS' performance the past 13 years for which I have happily been able to take credit are significantly the result of the work done by Dan and his management teams. I am extremely confident that he is the right person to lead STERIS into the future. To add to that confidence, I could relate a similar story about many additional members of our senior management team. Especially, including our CFO, our General Counsel, and the leaders of the commercial operations of business units at STERIS. Almost all of those leaders have been with us or companies we've acquired for over 15 years, and have stepped up and made significant improvements in their operations, while taking on increasing responsibility as we have grown. They've done great work that is individually and collectively added to the success of our Company. The meeting tenure of our 27 members of our senior management team is over 15 years longer than I've been with the Company. The median age is 53. The most should be here for a good long time. That talent and senior management team along with the 13,000 people of STERIS are the bedrock of our past success, and why STERIS' future is bright, and Dan and I both know it. I'm looking forward to having more time to spend with my family beginning this fall. I am blessed with the wife of over 40 years. I meant to say a wonderful wife of over 40 years, and have two fantastic adult children and their spouses who have given us nine young grandchildren. But I'm not stepping down until the end of July and will be fully engaged as CEO until that time. After that, I will be available to our management team and the Board of Directors for an additional two years. We believe that STERIS is stronger and better positioned than ever. With STERIS teams stands ready to capture additional opportunities and we continue to be confident that the future of STERIS is bright. With that, I will turn the call over to Julie for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Walt for your comments. Jamie, if you would please give the instructions and we could get started on Q&A.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
David Turkaly: Great, thanks. So Walt, I just want to get this timeline straight here. So you do a bunch of big strategic and accretive deals but put a feather in your cap, and then you step down and leave it to Mike and Dan to make it all work. I understand your explanation, but I'd love to just say what gives. How do you do that?
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, you know, a great question. In my experience, there's always something going on and usually something big going on in the life of companies. Whether it's an opportunity, an acquisition, a problem, a crisis. There's always something going on. So the question really is, what's the perfect time for a transition? And the perfect time in my opinion for a transition is just before a successful CEO is ready to go. And just after the incumbent CEO is ready takeover. That's the perfect time for a change and that's where we are right now.
David Turkaly: Thank you for that. We're certainly going to, I know, you'll be [indiscernible] certainly miss you being has actively engaged. I guess just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned Key Surgical, I think you said $15 million. I was just curious if you had any color on where that's did maybe versus what you saw, if there is any positive or negative surprises so far. Thanks a lot.
Walter Rosebrough: We're generally on track with what we thought with Key Surgical. The timing of the transaction, we're happy to get it done in November, but that's right before the Thanksgiving holidays and the Christmas holidays. So, actually we, I think we said to do about $15 million and we beat it by a bit. So we're pretty pleased there.
David Turkaly: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Lawrence Keusch: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Walt, congratulations here on what has obviously been a very successful career in building a lot of shareholder value for investors at STERIS and certainly wish you well, but I know we'll get a chance speak again here before it times out. I guess, I wanted to just pick up on a couple of points on the succession, and then I had a couple of quick sort of maintenance questions. But first Walt, you sort of talked about what you want to do with your time, but why is now the right time for you to be leaving? And in particular, because you indicated that you'd be in and sort of consulting role here for, until July of 2023. And then the second part of that question I'd really love to hear from Dan, because I think the -- one of the big investor questions will be, gee, this is all happening in front of the acquisition of Cantel. And so I'd really love to hear from Dan sort of just his thoughts around how he is approaching integration and specific thoughts around Key and Cantel specifically.
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Larry, I think I sort of answered the first part of your question already. I do think, again, there's always significant risks, opportunities, whatever in the life of a company, that's the beauty of it, by the way. That's why CEOs work 50, 70 hours a week is because there's always something going on. There is too much to do all the time. So there's no perfect time in my view as it relates to that. Having said that, the right time is again well, I'm still very active, very engaged, love what I'm doing, but see the end. And when Dan is ready, and he is little more than ready, he's probably little anxious to get us out of here. But the short answer is that, I think, is the Key -- is the timing of the person leaving and the successor. Now having said that, if anyone who knows me, knows that I'm not going to retire today. I'll be in there 60 hours a week until July 29, and they'll be lucky if they can get me out of here in less than 50 hours a week for the several months after that. I love what I do, love the business. For the last two or three years, set of purposes [ph], I've been giving advice not driving the business anyway, but people of this -- senior management team of this business is extraordinary. And they don't need a whole lot of help, truth, and people like Dan and Mike, and the people who work with them are more than capable of doing this work. I mean, truth, the matter is I've hardly been involved in Key, because Dan has pretty much taken that on. I've been more involved in Cantel for semi-obvious reasons, and I had historic relationships there. But in terms of implementing the work, I haven't been implemented for quite a while. So these guys are perfectly capable. I use guys in the both sexes, a term, by the way, third of that is female. So, I'm serious about using it in the -- in the sex-neutral term if you will. But these people know what they're doing and they will do a great job with or without me. Dan, I'll turn the second half to you.
Dan Carestio: Yes. Thanks, Walt. What I would say is Larry, since we started the process with Cantel, Mike Tokich and I have led virtually all the diligence efforts in terms of research and working with the leadership of Cantel to get to the synergies we drive. And I know that we're very confident in our leadership team and their involvement that diligence process as well and we're ready to execute once we get through the proper regulatory processes on that deal. In terms of the timing as a key opportunity here for STERIS is to look at the broader integration of Key and STERIS and Cantel, there is some -- some real synergies between the three businesses that we believe will play out in the future. And we're well down the path already in terms of integration, as it relates to Key Surgical and we're confident with where we are and the performance of the business. And our management teams have done roughly 50 deals over the last six, seven, eight years, right. This is the -- I don't want to stay another day in the office is the big deal, there is no doubt. But we did a pretty nice job with these exact teams working on synergy on the integration of that fairly large deal five or six years ago. So we're confident in our senior leadership's ability to execute on this deal and continue to be successful for STERIS.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, terrific. And then, just two quick questions here. Just -- on the AST margins again, obviously very impressive. And certainly, as I look back over time, I'm not sure that we've hit this to sort of margin level in the past. So two questions here, kind of how much of the performance is being driven by opportunities around COVID and how should we think about the sustainability and durability of that type of margin within the business? In other words, were there any one-timers in the quarter to think about? And then the second question, perhaps or Mike is, the cash flow improvement again is notable. You have called out working capital is certainly one of the drivers there. Again, what's the right way to sort of think about room to improve working capital going forward and also how to sort of think about CapEx in a broad sense. Thank you.
Dan Carestio: Hi, this is Dan. I can tackle the AST question first, if that's the case. So we are getting some benefit right now in terms of COVID-related [indiscernible] like testing kits and swabs and things of that nature, clearly are high demand and frankly everybody with a 3D printer these days is making swabs for test kits right now and those need to be sterile. In addition, we are seeing an increased demand from bio manufacturers, syringe manufacturers and those involved in supplying components into the manufacturing process for vaccine as well as significant growth in what we would categorize as bioprocesse, sterile disposables that are used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Those have been on a strong growth uptick for number of years, but that has been accelerated by the demand vaccine production. Now having said that, we're still seeing less than normal demand from our core medical device customers, especially those that operate in the realm of more elective-type procedures. Things like orthopedics and spine and things of that nature. So much of the core business has still been a bit suppressed in terms of normal growth rate [ph]. And we believe those a return to normalcy if you will, that will more than offset the short-term impact of some of the COVID-related benefit. Now having said that, vaccines aren't going away. I don't anticipate seeing any slowdown and use of bioprocess disposable business or any of the packaging or materials going into vaccines in the future. So we think that will sustain at a pretty high level.
Lawrence Keusch: And the margins.
Dan Carestio: Well, the margins are a function of really utilization and scale of our global footprint. And as the plants right now are pretty full, we're dropping through it pretty strongly on the revenue that we have. We've got a number of expansions coming in line, but those are metered out over time where I don't foresee that having any significant impact on the overall margin rate of AST.
Walter Rosebrough: Then Larry, I'll take the free cash flow. So obviously, very strong free cash flow for the first nine months of the fiscal year. And as I stated earlier, the combination of increases in net income and working capital improvement specifically. When I'm talking working capital improvements, we've seen fantastic efforts across our business in the collections of our outstanding AR balances. And actually have a DSO has once been down about two days for the third quarter. And we've continued to see improvements in those collection efforts throughout the whole year. And that's on top of elevated inventory levels, which we continue to maintain surety, supply and level. So if I look at longer term, obviously, I don't know if the levels of AR collections will be this good sitting here next year, but obviously the opportunity for us is to reduce the inventory. So hopefully overtime, we continue and should continue to improve our free cash flow position. As far as our capital expenditures, year-to-date we're up $11 million compared to where we were at this point last year. We anticipate to continue to spend at elevated levels, not only for the rest of this year, but also as we look out for the next couple of years, specifically around our continued expansions into our AST segment. We spent roughly $100 million a year over the last couple of years on those expansions. And sitting here today, I would guess that we would continue to spend a couple of $100 million at least annually for the next couple of years going forward.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, very good. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Walter Rosebrough: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Christopher Cooley: Good morning. And Walter, I just want to say congratulations on your upcoming retirement. It's been a true pleasure to work with you this last decade. And I just want to also call out what a gentlemen you are, acknowledging this morning was always been an extremely strong and hardworking bench. I don't think has been appreciated as much by the Street, but also I want to acknowledge that you've always had a various steady hand at the -- throughout the entire time. And you're going to be missed, but look forward to working with Dan. Maybe just two quick ones from me here this morning. First, when we think about what you're seeing more so on the healthcare side with capital and that build, just trying to make it, to get a better understanding of what types of projects you're seeing there that drove that new record backlog in that segment. And then secondly, I would like to follow on to Larry's comment regarding the cash flow, which was extremely strong in the quarter, especially in light of what's transpiring. Just want to think or maybe, this is for Mike or for Dan, if we start to step up our expectations for free cash flow generation, when we look at the yield versus the sales line historically, you're trending up. And clearly AST seems to be supporting that with higher -- higher margin. So I just want to think about, how we should think about cash flow on a longer term basis as well. Thank you so much.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Chris. On the healthcare capital side, we've talked about it a bit probably less than we could have or should have. And the number of new products we have in this space right now is very, very strong. Virtually everything in our surgical line has been refreshed in the last 12 to 18 months. Yes, booms, lights, tables, ORI, we have several new products that are in the infrastructure space, they're all doing nicely. So Surgical is clearly the operating room, what we call Surgical is, the operating room is very strong right now relative to last year. And IPT continues to be just an extraordinary piece of business on the capital side. So between the two -- and I would say, although we had, and still have a little trepidation about capital spending, when things -- when hospitals tend to pull back a little bit in capital, one of the last places, they tend to pull back is with the surgeons who generate the income for the hospital. So we have traditionally, and that pulled back as hard as some other areas, when things go bad. That means we don't jump up as much when things get little bit better. But I think it's a combination of, there was a little gap, when there wasn't so many orders. I think there are -- they seem to be back to "normal" at least in our space on the Surgical and IPT space. So I would say at a high level, that's it. And I'll let the other guys talk about the cash flow question you asked.
Michael Tokich: Yes. So Chris, this is Mike. Obviously, we are very proud of what we've accomplished this year from not only an earnings perspective, but also from a free cash flow standpoint. Although again as we are not giving guidance, the rest of this year, we hope to give guidance, I would think in the May time frame for the new fiscal year. But one of the other things that you got to be cautious about is, as we do, adjusted earnings on the P&L standpoint, we do not do adjusted free cash flow. So as we continue with acquisitions, especially the integrations and the cost of those integrations, especially around Cantel, we're going to be spending a significant amount of cash to get those cost synergies; so I'd be just cautious. If you were to back out and start doing an adjusted free cash flow, I would agree with you that it may be time to look at our step-wise change, but since we do not report that way, I would just be cautious of how you look at it.
Christopher Cooley: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan: Hey, good morning, everyone. And Walt, I think, you are leaving, but it's been a real pleasure seeing the evolution of STERIS over the last 5, 10 years, and congratulations. So, in honor of you leaving -- I'm going to ask some tough questions for Dan. And...
Walter Rosebrough: Good man.
Matthew Mishan: As an initiation, so, Dan, if you average out the last three quarters for life sciences, consumables, it's about 25% growth off a pretty good base which is good. But I guess it's just, it's just hard to believe that new vaccine demand is only up 25%. Can you give us a sense of like the mix of life sciences, consumables tied to vaccines. And then also when and where are your life science consumables typically used in production in comparison to -- and I know, it's always been a tough comparison to getting it, I think it never really works out, but to the beta bags, to clarify for folks trying to make a connection with their 70% order increase.
Dan Carestio: Okay. Thanks, Matt. And thanks for the challenge. So, what I would say is, I think we've talked about and you stated as well, on a year-to-date basis, our life science, consumable business is up roughly 25% give or take. And what we're seeing now is a little bit of pullback in terms of, as our customers burn off some of the -- the inventory they built early on in the early phase of the pandemic, when there is a lot of concerns about of supply. And we made it a point at STERIS to serve our existing customers in pharma and never deviate from that and sell outside of market to make sure those folks knew that we would have those validated chemistries as demand continue to rise as they got into vaccine. In terms of an actual percentage of how much is going to vaccine, it is impossible for me to say. And the reason why is that many of the vaccine manufacturers are also have been long-term large customers of STERIS that use our product from a bioprocess cleaning perspective in their normal day-to-day production of pharmaceuticals and biopharma. So it's not as if we're tracking down to the shop floor level as to every application of products go into. What we know though is that we are getting some uptick from vaccines as our customers sort of refocus in that area especially around COVID. And we believe that will be a trend that continues. In terms of the beta-bag products, that's a sterile transfer product that has an integrated lift and isolators. It's not something we do. We are in the space of sterility maintenance and sterility assurance. As it relates to bioprocess, no doubt with our carrier product solution group of products, and those have continued to do very well since the beginning of the -- they've done well, since the time of acquisition actually, but they've done very well since the pandemic really started and those products are up in the -- and has stayed fairly consistent in terms of their growth as opposed to slowing down as we've seen in the chemistries piece. Specifically on the chemistries, we have mainly two offerings there. One is what we call critical environment products and those are disinfectants and sterilants that are largely used in either aseptic manufacturing process or highly regulated clean rooms for pharma manufacturing. Now, not a lot has changed in terms of their application with COVID. There is just more application as it relates to increased vaccine production. And then the other large portion of our consumable business is what we would call bioprocess cleaners. And those are chemistry used for cleaning out the actual biopharma equipment used in the manufacturing process. So in between production runs, they assure they have the highest level of purity in terms of how they treat their machines and stainless steel in the process.
Matthew Mishan: Okay, excellent. And appreciate that answer. Well done, Dan, to start. So just going back to capital equipment. What was the impact on the backlog from the accounting change you made earlier in the year? Is it masking a higher year-over-year number? And then to continue with asking multiple questions, how should we think about orders versus shipments, especially as hospitals transition from the COVID surge to non-COVID surge through the course of the calendar year?
Dan Carestio: Matt, I'll take that first question about the impact of, so when we made the adjustment in the first quarter for the ORI [ph] deferral, we are starting to recognize that revenue as it is shipped rather than on install. It was about -- it was about $15 million uptick in revenue in the first quarter. And throughout this year, we really -- we've gotten rid of the backlog, if you will. But last year, it is still reflected in the backlog, and if you look year-over-year, there is about $12 million in last year's backlog. So if you need to adjust last year's backlog, if you want a true apples to apples comparison, if you do that, obviously we would be at an all-time record. But that's why we're near our record backlog, because of that impact.
Walter Rosebrough: We'd be $12 million to $15 million over last year and $12 million or $13 million over the best year we've ever had. The best spot we've ever had. And then the second question, sorry.
Matthew Mishan: Yes. And how should we think about orders versus shipments? I mean, obviously, our hospitals are obviously still dealing with the COVID-surge. And are they placing longer-term orders? Are these -- are these orders in which they are still now and replacement.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. As you know, our typical pattern is kind of 60-40. We have been a little stronger heavier, would it be right terminal say in terms of the big projects recently. But in order for us to have record order months and record backlogs, they both have to be chugging along. So, it is running much more like normal than it was, for example, six months ago.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then, last piece for me would be; how should we think about the operating margin level as compared to -- where we're at today as sales growth return your mix begins to normalize and you integrate two large acquisitions?
Walter Rosebrough: That's a lot of moving parts, and so -- that is a lot of moving parts, the -- obviously, the areas that have been very strong have tended to be toward our higher margin product. So there has been a bit of a mix effect. And as we ship more of the capital, and as we do more of that, there will be some, I'll call it mix effect, but as you know, we don't plan on keeping our cost to same level ever. And so we are working to reduce costs on which we pass on through lack of price, increase to our customers, some of which we take to the bottom line. So that's one set it makes us and then. As we bring the other businesses on board, it depends on which parts of those businesses are coming in. There is a natural mix effect, but on the other hand, given the level of synergies that we see, we think we will be offsetting that. So, we think that, if you were to look at it in a pro forma basis, if you will, how those businesses all look today and add them together, the margins are going to go up, because we're going to take more than $100 million out of the businesses that are coming on board. So we feel very good about that. And you know from our long association that I only care about growing profit dollars. And as long as we can go profit dollars, double-digits, that's what the team's mandate is. And if we happen to -- the margin happens to go up 10 basis points or down 10 basis points, I was going to sleep over it. But in the end, it's pretty hard to grow revenue at high single digits. And margins, and then profits at double digits, unless we grow margins. And that's our mandate.
Matthew Mishan: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Matson: Yes, thanks. So just want to go back to the capital orders in the healthcare business, do you think any of the strength you're seeing there is, because of pent-up demand sort of things that were deferred in 2020, because of the pandemic? And do you think that, if that's the case, I mean, is that something that you could be sustainable for some period of time?
Dan Carestio: Yes, Mike, this is Dan. I do think that we are experiencing some of that effect. And specifically, I mean we had really tough time, the sales reps getting access for three, four months, give or take. And just that, don't ever underestimate the ability of the sales organization's ability to sell and being present is very important. So I think there is some catch-up in those numbers. But generally speaking, when we talk to customers and hospital systems, there is a concern about the surge after the surge. And that is, what's going to happen with all these backlog surgeries that are elective or semi-elective once we get back to a normal steady state in terms of COVID and operating. So I think that's also helping us in terms of the sustainability of the capital backlog and the orders, we are seeing.
Michael Matson: Okay, thanks. And then just more of a housekeeping question, I was wondering about the -- you're excluding some COVID-19 incremental cost in your adjusted EPS. This isn't the first quarter obviously that you've done that, but I just wanted to ask about, if you could clarify what those costs are and kind of how you determine how much falls into that that line item? Thanks.
Michael Tokich: Yes. Certainly, Mike. And we've been, I'll call it consistent, if you will, all year surrounding this. And the makeup of that is, as we have put employees on furlough, and when I mean furlough, they're not doing anything for the Company. So they're just off completely. So we've taken the opportunity to capture those costs. Also we've been able to get some government reimbursement for those folks at the same time. So we're netting that cost into the adjustments. In addition to that, we have had to put in some training tools. We've done some enhanced cleanings, some different protocols that we've also done in our facilities across the globe. We've made some modifications to our buildings. Obviously, these traffic patterns have changed -- has changed. So all those costs surrounding that is what we're capturing and we're identifying separately as the COVID incremental costs as we're adjusting those out. To date, we're about just over $20 million for the first nine months. And that has significantly dropped from the first quarter levels and we anticipate it will continue to drop as most if not all of our employees are back to work. And recall, we were also very proud that we did not have to lay off anybody. This was our intention of keeping our folks whole and when our customers were ready to come back to work, we were there right alongside with them.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. I think, Mike, pretty much described it, just to be clear, those furloughed employees are all paid 100% of their base pay. And so the governments of the world depending on which part of the world they're in, make up some portion of that, but never all of it. And so that's been the cause. And that's really the most significant cause that we have captured. And in most cases where there is -- and certainly when there is government subsidy, it's absolutely clear that they cannot do anything, while we're -- while they are on furlough if you will. And we have taken that approach on anyone who we have captured, and this is that they are absolutely not working, and absolutely being paid 100% of their pay.
Michael Matson: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Polark from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Polark: Hi, good morning. A question on the leadership transition, two-parter, number 1, would you expect to backfill for Dan's COO role or elevate somebody else in your organization? That's part one. And then part two, for Dan. Dan, how many direct reports do you have today and once you get up and running in the new seat, how many direct reports would you expect to have at that point?
Dan Carestio: Yes. Sure, Michael. Thanks. So in terms of backfill, I would say, no, not in the existing role, I would not expect us to operate going forward with the COO. And in terms of my direct reports, currently I have eight or nine give or take right now. And what I would say is, it's likely with the acquisitions coming in and some change in roles within the organization, that's the number of direct reports I have on the commercial side of the business, we'll consolidate to some extent under leadership that we have in place. So I would expect that [indiscernible] indirect report, whether that's 8 to 11 or 8 to 12 or something like that. But I think over time, we'll sort of transition to something that looks more like that.
Michael Polark: And then, my second -- yes, yes.
Walter Rosebrough: Tell me, if I comment on that, that's 8 to 12 is kind of what we think senior executives should have. And it's a heck of a lot easier to save money. If we all have 8 to 12, and we don't have 4 extra Chiefs running around. And so that's been a hallmark of one of the ways that we operate efficiently is virtually everyone on my staff, virtually all the time, except, by the way for me right now. I'm also on vacation. I think I have three or four left, but everybody else is 8 to 12, and that's just kind of the way we operate.
Michael Polark: I appreciate that color. The second question was on the Cantel transaction, it sounds like there is no new news in terms of the timeline, would just be curious for a brief update there, the discussions with regulators. How are those progressing and then has there been a date set yet for the Cantel shareholder vote.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes -- it's still too early for any real news there. We're going through the process and determining the various countries, we do or don't need to file in and then getting those files. And so, it's way too early to comment at this point.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, and having no additional questions, I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody for taking the time.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q2  (2020-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the STERIS PLC Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO and Dan Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow, will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available on today's release, with reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, consecrate organic revenue increased 2% driven by 100 basis points of volume and 100 basis points of price. As the currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $5 million from prior year tuck-in acquisitions primarily in healthcare spread across capital equipment consumables and service. Gross margin for the quarter was up 140 basis points to 45% and benefited from mix, price and productivity. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.5% of revenue, an increase of 220 basis points from the second quarter last year due to higher gross margin attainment and lower operating expenses mainly for travel, sales and marketing and compensation due in part from business disruption from COVID-19. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.1% and includes the benefit of stock compensation, offset by unfavorable discrete item adjustments. Net income in the quarter grew 13% to $127.3 million and earnings increased to $1.48 per diluted share as compared to a $1.32 per diluted share in the prior year. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $312 million access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio we are well-positioned from a liquidity standpoint. Even reflecting the anticipated additional leverage for the key surgical acquisition, our debt levels remained solidly in our comfort zone. During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $43.9 million while depreciation and amortization was $54.4 million. Free cash flow for the first half was $185.6 million an increase of $23.6 million over the first half of last year, primarily due to improvements in net income and working capital somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks Mike and good morning all. I hope you all have voted or will later today. We are pleased to be with you to report such encouraging results for our second quarter, which reflect the resilience of our business and the good work done by STERIS associates. In total, constant currency organic revenue grew 2% year-over-year and improve substantially on a sequential basis. We benefited from the continued recovery in procedure volumes during the quarter as well as continued strength in segments with exposure to COVID-19 related products and services. Our release walks through the details, but I will touch on a few highlights of the quarter. Life sciences grew 16% in the second quarter, continuing its strong performance in particular for consumables. While it's difficult to dissect the 31% consumables growth in the quarter, we believe the underlying growth rate remained in the lower teens and the balance of the growth is due to COVID-19 pre-buying in anticipation of vaccine production demand. As we said all year, we do not anticipate maintaining these growth percentage levels in perpetuity. In particular our fourth quarter has difficult comparisons as last year's fourth quarter was the beginning of the life science consumables significant COVID-19 related revenue uptick. Rebounding from first quarter levels our AST segment grew 9% year-over-year in the quarter, benefiting from continued demand for COVID-19 product sterilization as well as a significant recovery of procedure-related medical device sterilization volumes. As we said in prior quarters, we continue to invest aggressively in capacity expansions at AST, reflecting our long-term expectations for the growth in this business. As anticipated, our healthcare segment continued to be impacted by some disruption and procedures in the quarter declining 3% year-over-year, but improving nicely on a sequential basis. Both consumables and service rebounded from first quarter levels with consumables revenue growing 6% year-over-year while service revenue was flat. Capital equipment shipments in the segment declined as we anticipated. Those shipments were down 14% versus the second quarter of last year. As you know we break our capital business into either large projects or replacements. We were pleasantly surprised to see replacement orders rebounding sequentially in the quarter reflecting a return to more normal procedure volumes. Capital equipment orders have grown sequentially through October from the low point in May and a return to about last year's levels. Like motion in our space, while we are pleased to see that sequential improvement in revenue from procedures to date there is significant uncertainty in the coming months as the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be escalating in many areas around the world. We have seen recent procedure declines in parts of Europe. It is too soon to tell what we will experience going forward in Europe and in the US in the next six months. That said, we are not planning a significant disruption of procedure volumes in the second half of our year. As a result we are planning for sequential revenue growth in the second half to result in about flat year-over-year revenue, excluding any impact from the anticipated key surgical acquisition. While we're quite pleased with the recent trends, the situation is fluid and difficult to predict. We still consider our healthcare capital equipment portfolio to have the greatest downside risk in the near-term. If procedures continue to improve and the pandemic subsides, we will expect some cost of operation to start coming back to more normal levels in the second half of the year, which will limit our bottom line percentage growth somewhat. As we said all long, we manage this business for the long haul. Our actions during this pandemic reflect that approach, including our decision to avoid unpaid layoffs or furloughs related to COVID-19. We worked hard to maintain jobs and compensation for our people putting programs in place to take care of those who need extra support and providing paid furloughs for those people in operations that were impacted by decline in the business due to pandemic. Total cost for COVID-19 programs and expenses were $4.5 million in our second fiscal quarter, about half of what we saw in Q1. Similarly, our approach to investments has not changed. We continue to expand our AST footprint and to invest in R&D. We've introduced a full suite of surgical products this year including new operating room lights, several new surgical tables and a next generation ORI system. On the infection prevention side of our business, we recently launched products include our new smaller footprint steam sterilizers and more rapid biological indicators among others. We do not expect the consequential slowdown in our new product development efforts or in spending for R&D as a result of the pandemic. Before we open to Q&A, I would like to again thank STERIS people for their commitment to our customers who have continued to be the heroes on the front lines of this pandemic. While there is uncertainty in the near-term given the COVID-19 situation, we like the positioning of our global portfolio during the pandemic as well as when we come out of it. We are working toward completing the previously announced acquisition of Key Surgical by calendar year and look forward to welcoming Key's people to the STERIS family. We stand ready to capture additional opportunity and continue to believe that the long-term future for STERIS is bright. With that, I'll turn the call over to Julie to open for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Rob for your comments. Jamie, would you please give the instructions and we're going to start the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator instructions] And our first question today comes from David Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
David Turkaly: The 100 basis points you talked about in price, I know you may not want to get into super detail about that, but I think that's a little better than what you’ve seen of late and I was wondering if you just might comment on where you're gaining that in particularly in this environment.
Walter Rosebrough: Yeah Dave 100 basis points, typically we are somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points. This quarter obviously we are that 100 basis point level and we are actually seeing price across all three of our segments in the second quarter. So I would not point out one individual one, but just across each of our segments.
David Turkaly: And then as a quick follow-up you mentioned you called out some working capital improvements. So I am just curious if we should view some of those as permanent or is it sort of a one-time or how are you looking at some of those improvements and how should we look at them moving forward? Thank you.
Walter Rosebrough: Yeah Dave I would say that from a working capital improvement standpoint, we've actually been successful in reducing our day sales outstanding pretty significantly this year although that is a little bit of math if you will because as EBIT does drop, the days sales outstanding do increase or decrease year-over-year and we have been offsetting inventory. Inventory is on the rise. We continue to have higher inventory levels because we are maintaining both surety of supply and we are level loading. So I would say that DSOs favorable, couple days, we should be able to continue to drive that at least the remainder of this fiscal year. I don't know about next fiscal year and I would also say that inventory our projection is inventory would still be elevated by the end of the fiscal year. So I would say those two will pretty much naturally offset and we will continue to see as long as we see net income growth, we will continue to see free cash flow generation. In addition, our capital expenditures are also up and as we've spoken about many times, we do anticipate spending over $100 million in expansion capital growth for AST. So don't be surprised if you see year-over-year growth in CapEx by the end of the fiscal year. We were up $13 million in the first half and we project to be more than that up for the full year.
Daniel Carestio: And I would add another temporal one is government tax payments have been deferred related to the Pandemic Act. There's a mix bag zero. I would say obviously the government payments are temporal, capital spending is more longer-term and I think as Mike has cleared, if you look a bit longer term, the inventory and receivables will probably revert back to their normal levels at the time.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan: I didn’t quite catch all of the guidance for the back half, did you say you’re going to be year-over-year flat for the full-year on organic growth basis and what are you implying for the second half versus the first half? I didn’t catch it all, I just wanted to clarify.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Matt, first of all good morning. But after good morning, we’re not guiding just to be clear but we have to plan even independent of the fair amount of uncertainty that's going on. And so we're planning roughly flat year-over-year revenue and that's largely speaking kind of all the same constant currency not constant currency. There's essentially no, in fact, I think no inorganic growth in the back half of the year. So that's an irrelevancy unless key comes in place, and we're not talking about key. But orders of magnitude, we're kind of thinking flattish. And it's our consumables business or recurring revenue business is continuing to grow with some conservatism on what capital is going to do for the back half of the year.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. Understood, and then the contribution just for clarity purposes, the contribution from tuck-in M&A over the next several quarters, I'm assuming that that wanes a little bit as those anniversary?
Walter Rosebrough: Zero, it's tiny, this quarter. Mike?
Michael Tokich: $5 million this quarter, Matt. And by the time we get to the third quarter, I believe almost every one of those will anniversary. So it will be if not zero, very, very close to zero. So we won't even speak to it.
Matthew Mishan: All right, I think everyone's happy about that.
Michael Tokich: We're unhappy, we'd like to have more, but we've got a significant one coming. So that's fine.
Matthew Mishan: All right. And then the Life Sciences Consumables business. Maybe I ask you this way, what is the capacity, you could you're about a $200 million business right now plus or minus. What is the capacity you could produce if customer said, just give me everything you got? Are you kind of maxing it out at this point at plus 30% or could you actually kind of flex that up even further?
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, we're not capacity constrained at this point, Matt and barring the ability to get the components, which I'm not aware of any where we’re struggling, so but you always have to pay attention to supply chain issues. But barring some supply chain issue that I'm unaware of, we could go up a great deal, you have to remember that most of our work in this space in IPT and Life Science are sharing factories. And so the capacity of those shared factories is greater, not everything goes up 50% and that's a problem. But the capacity that we have in the combined Life Science AST facilities, I don't feel that we have significant capacity issues.
Matthew Mishan: All right, excellent. And then I realized this last one, I realize it's a tough question given the volatility and the overall breadth of your portfolio. But how much do you think you're outperforming your end markets by with share gains? It just seems like you're just well above where the market would be.
Walter Rosebrough: I don't know about quantity and particularly in the short terms, Matt, it's very difficult to have a feel for us versus everybody else, if you will. As everybody reports, it's helpful, but we have a lot of competitors that are not public. So it's still difficult to get that overall reach. But I think we’re confident that we're getting more than our fair share of wallet in virtually all of our spots.
Matthew Mishan: Thank you very much, Walter. Thanks Julie.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Lawrence Keusch: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess first question here is, one of the really interesting things about the STERIS portfolio is that, you essentially have all these different businesses that can benefit and serve as hedges within during the pandemic, there are obviously exports of business set that are impacted as well. So really what I was just trying to understand for the quarter, is there any way to help quantify what you think the amount of tailwind was for revenue in the quarter? And conversely, what you think the amount of headwind was for the quarter?
Walter Rosebrough: Well, Larry, I guess that's a tough question to answer, but I think the easiest way to quantify it overall is we're running flat, which is better than again the segments that we tend to work in, all things being equal about flat in revenue, and we did not anticipate pre-COVID being flat. So we would have said that we would plan on being up probably this year, we would have expected to be up high single to maybe even into the low double-digit numbers. And as a result, I would argue that were probably about 10% negative headwind versus tailwind, plus or minus a little bit. So orders of magnitude, that would be our best to answer. And the places are obvious, right. In AST, where we're doing PPE and in Life Science, where we're gearing up for the vaccines, we're getting a nice tailwind, but we're a procedural base company in healthcare and procedures have gotten beat up. So that's been the opposite side of the equation.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, very good. Two other ones, on Life Sciences. So, I guess Walter, I'm just trying to again, understand how we should think about the exposure there to vaccine production. So, I’m wondering if you can talk a little bit about, are you exposed more to one type of vaccine technology versus another, are you exposed to very specific customers that if they make it through, that's a positive and if they don't, that perhaps doesn't positively impact you as much. And I guess the other part of that question is, as you've seen the improvements in the business, and the profits come through, how are you, are you letting that drop to the bottom line, are you investing that again, I'm just trying to think forward a little bit on this as to how you manage the margins as you come off the other side of this?
Daniel Carestio: Hi, Larry, this is Dan Carestio, maybe I can give you a little information on the market in particular, with vaccines, that's really in STERIS’s sweet spot in terms of our every [indiscernible] is by definition aseptic manufacturing. So it's manufactured in a sterile environment, and near sterile clean rooms, and the products that we sell, and the services that we have, are used to ensure that those environments can operate in an aseptic manner. In addition to what we're selling into vaccine from Life Sciences, we've also seen a significant uptick in demand in AST, in terms of bioprocess precursor, these are bags or liners or tubing sets and things like that used in aseptic manufacturing specifically for vaccines. And I wouldn't say that any one company or another in terms of the customers we serve is more has a higher demand or a lesser demand based on their methods. They're all basically very similar methods in vaccine production, and require an aseptic environment.
Walter Rosebrough: And Larry, I guess we’re broadly enough across, obviously, if all of our best customers happen to be the lucky ones we’re better, and if there's a couple that are not our best customers, the hot ones, that'll be a little worse. But I think we're pretty confident that the pre-buys that we're seeing are a function of the people who are likely candidates. So we're pretty comfortable that we’ll see an ongoing effect and I think in the short to intermediate term, it's unlikely it's going to shrink. It's just a kinky growing 30% a year forever.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, and on the margin question around you’re vesting against the improved profitability there, how are you doing that?
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, great question. Part of the margin expansion is strictly a function of mix. And so some of that's, I'll call it just natural, but and secondly, as most companies, I think we were not at all clear how ugly this thing was going to get when it started. And so we shut down hiring in certain places, we kept spending in the R&D functions, I caught the long-term future we kept spending, but on the short to intermediate term things, we kind of took a step back. And we'll pick some of that back up as we see I’ll call the long-term look going forward, we're increasingly comfortable as you might expect, but there's still a lot of uncertainty out there and we're watching it. Normally we watch quarter-to-quarter we watch and week to week right now. And there are so many things going on, some of which can be very positive, and some of which could not be not so positive. And so we're just being careful. So it will lag the spending piece probably a little bit for a while and then we'll catch up at the appropriate time.
Lawrence Keusch: Got it. And then last one for me AST margins just continue to be very impressive and continue to move higher. How do we think about these kind of do you think this is kind of peakish margins here, are you as some of these incremental volume comes in, whether it be around Life Sciences or other sterilization needed for the pandemic, is that coming in at higher price, and that's influencing the margins higher just again, trying to think about how we should really think about that the longer-term margin in that business?
Walter Rosebrough: The AST business, as you know, and we're very happy with the margins of that business, obviously. But that's ROS. And when you're ploughing hundred million or so every time you turn around to grow capacity, the ROIC is not extraordinary. It's good. I mean, we're not complaining about the ROIC in that space, it's a very good investment, but we're putting a lot of money to make that money in place to make that money. So I would not characterize it as over the top in terms of when you look at ROIC, so we think there's room for improvement as those new facilities mature. If you look back, and you were with us, like some time ago, when every time we added a plant, we had to knock-off 50 to 100 basis points, because each plant affected the overall ROS, today we have over 50 plants, so one plant doesn’t make that much difference, but if you look plant by plant, those newer plants are not making the kind of money on an ROIC basis, well on ROS or ROIC basis than the older plants are. So it's a function of those things.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, very good. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead with your question.
Christopher Cooley: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Walt, maybe if we could start with the big picture one here this morning. And kind of following on what Larry was getting out there. You structurally have a lift with your Life Science and AST franchises seeing accelerating growth. You've taken some costs out of the model through others, planned investment going forward. But should we also see over the next 18 months as the business starts to normalize, hopefully from COVID? Should we see a natural lift as well in cash flow in the business versus historical levels? Or how do we think about cash flow generation? Not so much for the back half of this fiscal year? But more so on kind of a go-forward basis? Should we see a natural lift there, or their uses of cash that will start to pick up there now, I've just got a couple of follow-ups.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Chris, I would say, both in cost. And as a result in cash, there's a lot of, I'll call it sales and marketing expense that's not going on in the world right now. And it has a limited detrimental effect, because none of our competitors are spending that money either. But when we return to the more real world, I suspect strongly that we and our competitors are going to put boots on the street more and travel more and do a number of things more that we cannot do. So that will have some normalization effect on earnings and cash will follow naturally with that. So I think that's point one, point two though your points will take as we grow in profitability, and we have mixed more toward some of those higher profit areas, then that profitability will flow through in cash completely. And then the only question is how much we're spending either in acquisition or for organic growth in order to the use of that cash and we fully intend to spend as much as we can for those two things, because that's what the future cash flow generations are. But if you pull out the investment side of it, yes, the cash will grow. Again, we would hope to be able to spend as much of that as possible to grow in the future in a reasonable way organically and through acquisition.
Christopher Cooley: Appreciate that color and then maybe just two quick follow-ups. But first could you just remind us when the last time was that you had resolidified your raw materials contracts more specifically for Cobalt 60 on that front, a lot of discussion about that here as of late, as I'm sure you're aware and just want to revisit when those were last revisited kind of the terms of those agreements. And then one other quick follow-up. Thanks.
Walter Rosebrough: Hey, Chris, appreciate the question. We do not get into the details of our vendor contracts, just like we don't get in the details of our customer contracts. Suffice it to say that we have visibility for a reasonable time, we tend to do both of those on a long-term basis, particularly in the AST business and kind of everybody the suppliers, the vendors, and the customers recognize that everyone's in a better spot, if we all know what we can and cannot provide and what people are going to do and not do. So those tend to be intermediate to longer-term contracts. And that's the case in across the board.
Christopher Cooley: Understood, appreciate that. And then lastly and then I’ll get back in queue, just want to make sure I am squaring my assumptions correctly. So in your essentially flat, directional planning for the full fiscal year ex-Key Surgical, you’re not assuming I guess any incremental headwinds from COVID-19 in the back half of the year, or you’re still assuming some incremental headwinds, maybe whether it's from procedure softness, as you cited in parts of Europe now are they experiencing that or maybe it's purchasing patterns. And in prior conversations on these calls, we've talked about, hospitals carrying a little bit higher consumable inventory on site than what they had in the past. Just wanted to make sure, I fully understand what you're making. And when you're talking about getting the flat year-over-year for the fiscal year ex-Key Surgical, appreciating there's a tough fourth quarter comp? Thank you.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Chris again, I'm planning and that plan can change next week or next month. So and that's why we're not giving guidance. There are so many uncertainties right now, both positive and negative, that we think it's uncharacteristically difficult time to forecast. But having said that, in general, we're not anticipating a huge reduction in procedures like we saw in April, May, June, or in the March, April, May, we're not anticipating that level of reduction which was pretty catastrophic. But we will, we do expect temporal changes, kind of spot changes around that's kind of built into our thinking. Again, we do expect and part of that is one offsets the other a bit, if we have a little more of that, we have a little more PPE process, and we have a little less, we have a little less PPE and a little more of the procedural devices. So, we're balancing those issues. And our best view of that is that, we come out about flat. Having said that, it is we still given the history that we've seen to date, which is about the best thing we have to work off of, and how nice a job the facilities have done with the treatment protocols of COVID-19. I think that's kind of grossly misunderstood and underappreciated as the facilities around the globe and the physicians and nurses around the globe have really improved their knowledge of how to deal with this disease. So even as it heats up some, they're a lot better, a lot better positioned to take care of patients, and as a result have done things to be able to continue to operate their procedural spaces, it would only be in my view, unless it goes a lot worse than anticipated, it would only be patients deciding that due to concern of COVID, that would reduce the procedures a great deal. So we just have to wait that one out. But in general, we’re expecting some spot issues around the globe, but not an overwhelming reduction like we saw before. We're expecting to see some additional PPE and processing as a result, and clearly we're anticipating good growth or good volume in the Life Science business for vaccine production. So at a high level, I'd say that's pretty much it. We’re being a bit cautious in our view of capital, even though orders have come back quite a bit better than we expected being flattish recently is better than anticipation, but capital can bounce a little bit, so we're being a little cautious on our thinking about capital.
Christopher Cooley: Thank you.
Walter Rosebrough: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham and Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Matson: Yes, thanks. I just want to ask about gross margins. I mean, they were up a fair bit year-over-year and sounds like some of that was driven by mix. So is that something that's sustainable? Is that something that could potentially go the other way, if your growth rates kind of revert back to more normalized rates in the different businesses?
Walter Rosebrough: I would say the single biggest thing on the quarter is that you saw that Healthcare Capital was down, and kind of everything else was up. And so that is a mix effect of Healthcare Capital comes back over a longer period, you'd expect that mix down. On the other hand, if it comes back, and everything's still growing, and we do see AST and Life Sciences growing faster in general than most of the healthcare space, it's still a positive impact, kind of long-term temporal impact on margins in my view.
Michael Matson: Okay, thanks. And then just wanted to follow-up on Larry's question about the Life Science business and the potential impact of the vaccine. So how do we think about that that business as the vaccines start to be launched? I mean, does that mean that the demand for your consumables would then decline because there's been comps destocking orders or would it can remain strong as the vaccines are rolled out? Thanks.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, we don't have perfect visibility to that, if we did, we would probably be giving differential guidance than what we're giving, but that's a tough call, my experience is in this space, that vaccine or I would call the pharma folks who are running these facilities are the most conservative of our customers when it comes to supply chain. So my suspicion is they're going to hold a fair amount of inventory for a long time until they know that they’re in good shape and know what they're running, know how much they're going to have to build, and know what their requirements are going to be. So I don't think in the short term, there's going to be a huge reduction. As we work through this, if indeed, they're overstocked, they will slow it down. And if they're not, they won't, but generally speaking, they tend to be kind of conservative on supply chain, appropriately conservative, those factories, you shut one of those things down, you're shutting down millions of dollars a day, not millions of dollars a year. So they're pretty careful about their supply chains. But again, we do not have perfect visibility, just like we don’t have perfect visibility to who's going to be building when. I should also mention, another effect of this has been our capital and I've talked about capital healthcare, being at risk our capital life sciences at all-time records, all-time record backlog, all-time record shipments, everything you want to look at. So the capital equipment in life science is quite strong. And we’re not citing it in the short to intermediate term.
Michael Matson: Okay, thanks. That was very helpful. And then just on that, I heard your commentary around the orders improving since they kind of bottomed in May, but it does look like the healthcare backlog was down kind of double-digits year-over-year. So is that just more of a lagging indicator or something that’s why that's not showing kind of better year-over-year change? Thanks.
Walter Rosebrough: It is you may recall that in the first quarter, we had accounting change that resulted in roughly $15 million of ORI being recognized in the first quarter, that that number for this quarter is probably more in the $10 million to $12 million range. But so if you look at this based on a similar approach, you would see that the backlog is roughly the same plus or minus a little bit but so it's down, but it's not down double-digits. And so that's it in the short run, but capital has been under pressure, more pressure than many of the consumables. And we just have to see, it's nice to see that the replacement business seems to be returning, which is roughly 60% of capital orders. So we’ll see the next several months. It's been sequentially moving the right direction and we hope it continues that way.
Michael Matson: Okay, great. Thank you.
Walter Rosebrough: You bet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Polark: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple here. Curious on PPE and AST, Walt do you have a view? Did volume from that category in total flat sequentially versus the June quarter up down? I'm just curious how that that piece is trending.
Daniel Carestio: Yes, this is Dan. I think it's been more governed by supply than it has been demand at this point. And as the suppliers have ramped-up on the raw material, we were seeing similar levels that we saw in Q1, maybe a slight uptick. We do believe there'll be sustained increased demand at some level for PPE onto the future, as the requirements for those products for certain procedures have changed, even with or without the pandemic.
Michael Polark: As you fill back up and PPE stays at these kind of elevated new normal levels, let's assume and electives recover. And presumably, your global network is quite tight, hence significant amount of CapEx going into AST. Are there issues that arise where preference is discussed between where you make decisions about who gets access to the facilities and when or is there enough capacity, such that those frictions don't arise? I'm just curious how that in a world over the next, handful of quarters as we learned to live with these electives recover, PPE stays elevated? Is there a risk that your capacity gets very tight?
Daniel Carestio: Well, one there's a reason why we're building a number of plants right now across the globe. In North America, Europe and Asia, we have more builds going on in AST than ever in my lifetime right now because we see long-term increased demand in terms of customer capacity constraints at a given site, it does happen from time to time and we work with our customers across to validate, or multiple methods of sterilization, so that for some period of time, it may not be optimal for their supply chain, but we can get the product sterilized into the market.
Walter Rosebrough: Helpful, yes. I would say, Mr. Carestio always tells me that it's like jello, there's always room for jello. Always room for one more customer.
Michael Polark: And I'm sure you're not running facilities at every hour of the day, or is that?
Walter Rosebrough: No, we’re. For essentially Christmas Day in the Western world, we run 24/7.
Michael Polark: Got it. The other topic was SG&A. I just didn’t know you're not putting a fine point on the back half. But in the context of ex-Key Surgical revenue expectation of flat year-on-year. How would you frame SG&A dollars for fiscal 2021 in the context of that revenue outlook reasonable to expect those dollars are flat, is there quite a bit of those such that the ratio is similar year-on-year for the full-year? Or would you expect variance one way or the other?
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Mike for the first half, obviously, we saw a lot of favorability there, in the second half we would say there's going to be favorability but nearly not as much. And then obviously for the full-year, we would expect to see a decline in total. And then obviously as we look to the future, we will give guidance hopefully at that point in time when we know more. But definitely, definitely anticipate that we would be spending more operating expenses in the second half of the year versus the first half.
Michael Polark: Thank you very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we’ll conclude today's conference, today's question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks everybody for taking the time to joining us this morning. Stay healthy.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we’ll conclude today’s conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-08-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the STERIS PLC First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO and Dan Carestio our Chief Operating Officer. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow, will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available on today's release, including with reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights, our first quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a decline in volume, offset by 70 basis points of favorable price. As a reminder Healthcare Capital Equipment revenue in the quarter reflects a one-time benefit of $15 million for a change in the timing of revenue recognition. You may recall that when we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal 2019, our operating room integration capital equipment products required significant onsite system configuration during the installation process. As a result, we were required to defer all revenue until the installation was complete. Since then, we have enhanced the design of our OR product line, which allows for full assembly and configuration of the equipment in our plant before shipment and simplifies the installation process. As a result, revenue is recognized based on the shipping terms, consistent with other capital equipment products. In addition, constant currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $10 million from prior year tuck-in acquisition, primarily in Healthcare spread across capital equipment consumables and service. Excluding both of these items, total company constant currency organic revenue would have declined 8%. Gross margins for the quarter was about flat at 44.1% and was impacted favorably by mix and price somewhat offset by lower productivity due to reduced volumes. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.3% of revenue an increase of 180 basis points from the first quarter last year, due in part to approximately a $5 million benefit from the change in the timing of revenue recognition as I noted earlier, as well as lower travel expenses, compensation-related costs and sales and marketing expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3% and includes the benefit of stock compensation deduction. Net income in the quarter grew 6%, to $111.8 million and earnings increased to a $1.31 per diluted share. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $255.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA, we are well-positioned from a liquidity standpoint. During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $66.9 million while depreciation, amortization was $49 million. The increase in capital expenditures versus the prior year is related to expansion projects within the AST segment. Free cash flow for the quarter was $67.4 million, an increase over the first quarter of last year, primarily due to improvements in working capital and deferred tax payments under government programs. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our solid overall performance in the first quarter reflects the diversified nature of STERIS' business across our medical device, pharma and Healthcare customers. Collectively, our constant currency organic revenue declined just 3% while adjusted earnings increase compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. Given the circumstances, we are very pleased with those overall results. Healthcare, our biggest segment most impacted by the reduction in deferrable procedure revenue declined 10% with mixed performance across the segment. Healthcare consumables were down 28% for the quarter, but we generally saw monthly sequential increases culminating in near prior levels by the end of June. As we discussed last quarter, and asked me business continued to be one of the most impacted areas for STERIS, but it is following the same trend as the rest of consumables. Service declined 10% but also witnessed similar trends as consumable products, with June returning to prior year levels in our equipment service business. In Healthcare Capital Equipment which grew 6% Q1 shipments continued from strong backlog entering the year as well as the $15 million benefit in ORI, that Mike mentioned earlier. I would add that this benefit in revenue, also reduced Healthcare backlog by the same $15 million as those shipments were recognized. Even with that reduction, we ended the quarter and $164 million of Healthcare capital backlog, down just $8 million, compared to the first quarter of last year when the ORI change is taken into account and up $9 million sequentially from Q4 with the same adjustment. As I have commented before, we would not be surprised to see Healthcare Capital Equipment come under some pressure over the coming quarters, particularly replacement equipment, some of which can be delayed by our customers. Turning to AST, which serves medical device customers. That business' revenue was flat with the prior year. This was largely the result of continued elevated demand for PPE sterilization, offsetting a reduction in devices for deferrable procedures. Once again, we experienced increased procedural device processing on a sequential basis within the quarter. Life Sciences revenue grew 21% in Q1, as we continue to benefit from our pharma customers expectations for growth in vaccines and biologics. Supporting that growth, Life Sciences consumables grew 34% versus last year, which is exceptional performance, driven in part by our customers desire to build inventory. While we would not suggest this growth rate is sustainable. We do continue to see favorable growth trends for this business. Our margin and earnings improvement reflected our success in spending reduction, in particular travel expenses and variable selling costs, which will generally come back as our businesses return to normal. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we chose to avoid unpaid layoffs. Instead, we placed our underutilized people on short-term fully paid furloughs, some of which were partially subsidized by governments around the world. We attracted costs related to that decision along with other COVID costs about $9 million net of government subsidies and are excluding these items from adjusted profit in the quarter. We believe that maintaining our trained and dedicated staff was the right thing to do, and is helping us now support our customers as they ramp up Healthcare procedures to normal levels. Our furloughs have been reduced substantially as businesses come back. On another note, we have continued to invest in R&D as originally planned, and we expect to do so going forward. As a result of these factors, we anticipate that our adjusted SG&A dollar spend will rise as business rebounds. Since we last spoke to you in May, we witnessed a turnaround in deferrable procedure volumes in the United States and Europe. While the recovery is still region-by-region and some COVID hotspots are occurring, we have been pleasantly surprised to how quickly Healthcare providers have been able to bring procedure volumes back. Many of our product lines are now running flat to slightly up as compared to the prior year. Although we may see some reductions due to COVID hotspots, we do not expect to return to the low levels of deferrable procedures experienced in April or May, as Healthcare providers have improved their ability to come back to disease. We believe that STERIS' balanced business model will continue to be a benefit and remain optimistic and we are well-positioned to respond to changes and uncertainties in the market. Now changing gears a bit from our financial performance. Yesterday, in our earnings release, we announced the addition of a new Board member, Chris Holland. You may know Chris from his role as CFO at CR Bard, prior to the acquisition by Becton Dickinson. Chris brings a great experience to our Board and we are happy to have the benefit of his insights and perspectives. We also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday, bringing us to $0.40 per share per quarter and representing our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase. As Mike discussed, our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong, and we are pleased to be able to continue returning value directly to our shareholders through our dividend. As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting Healthcare, we are very fortunate to be in the business we are in and to be in strong financial position. Our plans to be nimble and ready to support our customers as needed are already paying-off. We believe that our approach to managing through the pandemic leaves us well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities. Before we open to questions, we express our respect and gratitude to the Healthcare providers of the front lines in the pandemic around the world. These are unprecedented times and the challenges facing caregivers have been unexpected and monumental, and they continue to do remarkable work till this day. We also thank the people of STERIS, those working with our customers in the field and those working behind the scenes in our factories, labs, offices and from their own homes in this unusual time. Our team has done a great job of adjusting to this difficult situation, while serving customers and their patients. Our confidence in our strategic positions and operating capabilities continues to grow. While there is more uncertainty in the near-term given the COVID situation, both potential upside and downside, we stand ready to capture opportunities and mitigate risks. We continue to believe that, the long-term future for STERIS is bright. I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Rob for your comments. Mike, if you would please give the instruction, we can started with Q&A.
Operator: Yes, ma'am. [Operator Instructions]. The first question we have will come from Dave Turkaly of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
David Turkaly: Great. Good morning. Walt, maybe just to kick it off here. I would love to get your thoughts, given the customer base that you have, on sort of what the state of the consumer is today, meaning like patients of the hospital, their attitudes towards, surgery and going in. I know you mentioned that monthly, your progression improved. I just love to get your high level thoughts on, do you anticipate that continues ahead. And have you noticed the difference in terms of hospitals opening up to the surgery said it did come back rather quickly?
Walter Rosebrough: Well, the answer is certainly, Yes. I think the Healthcare systems around the country and around the world have done a fantastic job of assuring patients that it is safe to go to their facilities for procedures and they have done a number of things and done that in a number of ways. I don't know if you happen to have been into hospital surgery center recently I have, and the precautions that they are taking are fantastic. Both with their own staffs and with the patients who are coming in, visitors are longer coming in. So, they have taken care of that problem pretty straightforwardly. There are all kinds of methods that they have used and again, we are talking to him all the time about this. First, my understanding from speaking with a number of them, is it kind of the patient or potential patients number one factor in making that decision is their physician. And so, they have done great work in outreach using their physicians and their physician offices to give outreach to the patients, reassuring them that the hospital may be one of the safest places to be, as opposed to all kinds of other things that people are doing around the country, which is what is causing COVID to be spread. So, and I think that the facts bear that up. They have done a great job with PPE. We know a number of physicians groups, who had extraordinarily low amounts of COVID in their own staff, even though they are actively involved, heavily actively involved in COVID patients. So, it is both the work they have done to make their places safe and the of the marketing, marketing to let people know that it is safe to return, it is largely the physicians doing that not the facility so much. The other things they have done is they have moved more and more procedures into spaces that patients feel more comfortable. So, in the ambulatory surgery centers, and other types of centers like that, as well as the standard operating room. So, I mean, really, it is pretty miraculous the work they have done in the last two or three months to offset this significant concern among potential patients. And of course, the toughest areas are the places like New York City that were overrun early. And it is been, I think, somewhat easier in other spaces where we didn't see that level of burden on the hospitals.
David Turkaly: Thank you for that. Maybe quick follow-up for Mike. The 15 million is that the last we see that or is that something - I know you mentioned from that 2019 change. But does that happen again in the future is that is that done now?
Michael Tokich: No Dave, that was a that is a onetime adjustment that we had. So, we are finally at this point in time, you will not see that again.
David Turkaly: Great, thanks so much.
Walter Rosebrough: David, only to the extent that that business grows, the growth will come quicker just because the revenue is recognized quicker, but there is not a - if you will pull-forward like effect.
David Turkaly: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Next we have Chris Cooley of Stephens Inc.
Christopher Cooley: Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the questions, and congratulations on a solid quarter there. Maybe if I could, let's take a little bit of a look at the margins for my first question on both Life Science and AST and I appreciate the commentary Walt that you saw some stocking of consumables in particular in Life Sciences. But, you hit a record growth - margin there in Life Science of 41.5% which is really enviable. Help us think a little bit to able to how that business may have shifted structurally, such that as we start to see some normalization there in consumable purchasing patterns? How we think about that operating margin? And I guess, similar to that, a little bit of a taper on AST, which is to be expected with the shift more towards PPE in some instances. Is that something that, we should think about lingering throughout the fiscal year and kind of slowly working its way back out? Or is that something that would start to reverse itself maybe more so in the second half of the fiscal year? Just want to make sure, we are thinking about the marketing contribution correctly and I have got one quick follow-up.
Daniel Carestio: Okay. Hi. This is Dan Carestio actually. And on the Life Science question, I think the increased margin that you saw in the first quarter was heavily-based on the fact that we had a mix of very high consumable revenue stream. Some significant portion of that is stockpiling by our customers just for a sure you supply and some portion of it is actually also increased demand from those customers. With all of the investments being drilling out right now in vaccine production, that is an area that is really in STERIS Life Sciences sweet spot for our portfolio, because it requires a septic manufacturing. So to the extent that is sustained, we believe we will see some sustained benefit for our consumables business in particular. To the extent that pharma starts making a significant expansion investments in any other CMOs or their factories, then we may see some benefit in our Capital Equipment side of the business in the future. But in the interim short-term, we see it as purely a consumable play at this time.
Walter Rosebrough: And Chris, I guess I would add, I don't think anyone is thinking vaccines are going to slow down the next year or two. So, if anything, we feel bullish in general in the space, 34% year-over-year, we are not planning on that for very long, but we are bullish in the space. And on AST, if you called it that on PPE is a high volume, relatively speaking lower margin product than many of the consumables that are related to surgeries that have been deferred. And so, that is largely a mix issue and I would expect it to slowly reverse as the surgical type devices come back. Now, I don't know that we are going to see PPE slack off a great deal. So, it may not move back to the original numbers, but orders of magnitude I would expect some of it to come back due to mix.
Christopher Cooley: I really appreciate the color. And then just finally from me, Walt in 15 plus years here, the leverage ratio being below 1.5 times. I'm toggling across here. It has been really long time since I have seen -. And I understand and greatly appreciates you always ran the business very conservatively not leveraging up here and especially not in a challenge time. But this is a relative historic low level for that either. Just curious, where you see opportunities from an M&A perspective, from an opportunity to invest back in business to either enhance the margin profile, longer term or current growth. But I'm assuming rather than just accruing cash on the balance sheet, even after the 8% increase in the dividend here this quarter, there is got to be opportunities to deploy cash, just how do we think about the capital structure? Thanks so much.
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Chris, we have spoken about that and have been very, very consistent over the decade or so. You have talked about in terms of how we intend to spend our capital, we do intend to provide dividends. We think that is a good discipline of management to grow dividends, somewhat in line with the profit and cash flow of the business. We absolutely intend to continue to investing in the businesses we already have. And, and you are clearly seeing that, as Mike mentioned, we actually spent more capital this quarter than we did a quarter ago last year, we have less significant investments moving forward in the AST space for growth, which we absolutely believe this coming. And also in the hospital outsourced processing business we have and intend to spend significant capital. So those in we are spending capital every place those two are just orders of magnitude kind of larger, with some of the others at this moment in time and that is in our view because of the long-term opportunity in those spaces. But in general, I would rather spend money in the businesses already run to make them either more efficient or new products then running around looking for new things. After that, we want to run around look for new things. And we did have a number of things on our plate when this little COVID issue hit us and so we pulled back on that due to the near-term uncertainty in the space. We are feeling more comfortable that our own cash situation is in good shape and that then we can kind of go back to the search and hunt. But, those things timing of those are never known. So, I wouldn't suggest something is going to happen tomorrow morning. But it would be surprising if over the next year or two we don't see things that are worth investing in and add to our portfolio. We like things that are either in our space or right now door to our space. We don't like stepping out, loudly into things we don't understand. So, at a high level that hasn't changed, it is just we took a little pause in, it seems like we are going to range of four, you remember last year we did a six or seven there relatively small cover before we did some relatively large ones. We don't control the timing on those things. Usually the seller has more control of the timing than we do. But we certainly continue to see a pipeline of things and intend to be active. And we are far more comfortable today than we were 90-days ago in making those kind of decisions.
Christopher Cooley: Thank you.
Operator: Next we have Mike Matson of Needham and company.
Michael Matson: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to start with the what you are hearing from hospitals outlook for capital equipment spending, the hospital have obviously been hit by the elective deferrals, but there is also been a huge infusion of cash from the government. So just any thoughts there would be helpful.
Walter Rosebrough: You know I have probably said this hundred times since I have been at STERIS. But, the Healthcare capital spending loves change and hates uncertainty. And so, we have been in a little bit more uncertain times the last a little bit, but we are also seeing changes. So, it is not clear exactly how that is going to work out over the next year or two. As I said, this move - we already saw that the greatest growth rate in our capital spending for Healthcare was moving to ambulatory surgery type of facilities. Whether they be a part of a hospital system or not. And so, I would not be surprised if that accelerates, given what I said about trying to move patients to places that they feel more comfortable A, closer to their homes and B, there is just less traffic if you will. And so, I would not be surprised to see that spending accelerate. We have felt for some time that both particularly entree surgery centers, as you see them take on more and more extensive surgeries, they cannot have the same type of capital equipment. They need a stronger infrastructure to do that. So, I would expect to see that mix move up in ambulatory surgery. And again, they can’t do orthopedic implants with the sterilization capacity they currently have. So, we think that is opportunity both for capital spending and for our ORC. So, we do see the intermediate to longer-term positively in that space and for every surgery that moves out of the hospital, they put in two more complex surgeries, for one heart lung transplant does not equal one artificial knee. And so, even though the numbers may stay constant, the intensity continues to rise. So in the long-term, we see it growing with hospital or Healthcare revenue, generally speaking as it has for the last 30 somewhat years. In the very short-term, there are a number of places just like we did put on capital freezes. But I think as they get visibility to their cash flow, they will begin spending again more than their normal fashion. And then, the good news for us is we had a very good backlog going which we rarely see cancellations. And then lastly, the big projects are rarely stopped or slowed down. I mean, just slow down a little bit just for labor, but they are rarely stopped or slowed down in any consequential way. Once you put steel on the ground, you need to fill the facility. So those will, I think, will continue as they would have. But the pipeline's a bit softer right now than what we saw 90-days ago, let's say or before COVID got serious in U.S. But for roughly 45- days to 60-days, we had no ability for our salespeople to access facilities. They shut down everything, but patient care. And so, we are now back in the field, working with facilities on their needs. So, I think it is early yet to predict the exact strength or lack of strength in capital equipment. But, I think the intermediate to longer-term looks pretty good.
Michael Matson: Okay. Thanks. And then just as far as AST goes. That sounds like the PPE has been driving a lot of sterilization demand, you expect that to continue to remain strong. At the same time devices, the electric procedure seem to be recovering. So, imagine the volume of device or laser specialization can be going up. So, is that the right way to think about it? And then do you feel like you have got adequate capacity to meet all that demand if those things are both seeing high volumes? Thanks.
Walter Rosebrough: In short, yes. Is the answer your first question is that the way we see it, this is almost exactly how we see it. The second question in terms of capacity, there is a reason we are spending several hundred million dollars over the next few years building capacity in AST. Because we believe the demand will be there to utilize that capacity and we always try to stay ahead of it to the extent that we can. So, we do think that there will be capacity requirements going forward and we are building to meet that demand.
Michael Matson: Great, thank you. 
Operator: The next question we have will come from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.
Lawrence Keusch: Thanks and morning, everyone. Walt I wanted to touch on just a couple quick things here first on Healthcare. Just curious how you are thinking about surgical procedure volumes, let's call it in the second half of the year. I know that things have obviously improved through June and probably there is been at least some stabilization in July. But we just don't understand I don't think surgical procedure volumes actually can grow. In the fourth quarter of this year do you think that kind of run it levels that are actually down year-over-year. And again, as part of that question, do you kind of view the fiscal fourth quarter, sort of total growth here, the lowest that you would expect for the year? And then two other ones quickly?
Walter Rosebrough: I will try to answer questions that are a little confused by the last piece of it. But the short answer is, I do think, procedure volume still has room to grow from where it is, if you think about it, we are approaching last year's levels. And I would say most of the places that I have talked to the facilities are saying they are running, 85% or 95%, kind of numbers of last year. But typically we see 3%, 4%, 5% growth so, in the same AST business described as, it is basically did last year, but that is not that is not normal for us, right, we would expect to see 5%, 6%, 7% percent growth. So, my answer to that is there is probably some catch up from the last quarter or so that is going to occur and then there is also a catch up of the growth that will have occurred. How quickly that all happens, I think is a wild card. But in general, if you take them more 18-month to 24-month view, my view is that the normal growth we would have seen will occur and we are likely to see some catch up on top of it.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, perfect. And then just maybe I didn't state the question clearly enough. I was just again trying to understand if you think this fiscal fourth quarter as you think about the dynamics across the business, kind of marks below for the fiscal year for you guys. As you look at growth year-over-year. And then I guess I will just ask one other quick question. UK certainly seems to be lagging quite a bit from the rebound in surgical procedure volumes over there. So again, just sort of wondering what you are seeing in your outsource business and instrument repair business. And I guess one from Mike, again just I know you mentioned this on the call when Walt was chatting in his prepared comments. But what exactly was being excluded from gross profit associated with COVID costs? Thanks very much.
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Larry. Again, if we were comfortable understanding relative growth rates for quarters, we would be giving guidance. And so, timing is probably the toughest thing to call right now as opposed to I will call it general trend. And so, I think we have laid out our views of the general trends, the timing, we are not nearly so comfortable on that question. So I don't know that we would have a strong feeling that, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter is going to be our best or worst year-over-year performance. You are absolutely correct about the UK. At this moment, it tends to be the lagging entity in Europe. It is the converse is true, the rest of Europe, the rest of Europe has been ahead of the U.S. in bringing back procedures in our businesses both AST and ORCs are showing that. So, I will it call Continental Europe for lack of better terms has been stronger, coming back quicker, I should say, and UK has been the slowest entity in our space. As you know, the UK is relatively small piece of our business. But it is real and we have seen - the ORCs are coming back from there very low levels, that they were in earlier in the year. But they are not as far back as ORCs in the United States on average. So, at a high level that is the answer to that question.
Michael Tokich: And then Larry, from your question regarding what is being adjusted out for the COVID-19 costs. As Walt talked about, the majority of that $9 million is related to the opportunity, we talked to furlough some of our under-utilized folks and we also received some of the benefits from the CARES Act in particular, also from some of the other government benefits in the UK and Italy that we are paying a portion of our furloughed employees at that point. And as we did in the fourth quarter, we also had some meeting cancellation costs. We did not hold our Annual Meeting this year, so we has some cancellation costs associated with that. We had some PPE specifically for our employees, and we had some above and beyond enhanced cleaning protocols that we have also put into that incremental cost. So, the total net cost of all that is $8.7 million in the quarter, compared to about $800,000 in the fourth quarter of last year.
Walter Rosebrough: I think orders of magnitude Larry without getting into numbers, the non-furlough piece probably is pretty similar last quarter and this quarter in orders of magnitude and the bulk of that money is the furlough people, and they are largely back to work at this point.
Lawrence Keusch: So, just to finish at that, as you look into the next quarter, we should assume that any excluded costs from gross profit should go down, I would think.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. Our expectation is that, revenue will rise and cost will fall or revenue will rise and cost will rise with it as excuse me, as we bring people back to do that work, we will have certain costs.
Michael Tokich: We will continue to have certain costs or we will we will have certain costly protocols. But not to this extent, if you will.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next, we have Matt Mishan of KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: Hey Walt, Mike, Julie thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow up on vaccine production. Assuming that that we are going to get to full production of vaccines sometime in 2021. What are your customers indicating their needs might be from you. And any chance you could put some contacts or quantify what the opportunity might be?
Walter Rosebrough: At a high level, the we do for, for lack of better terms COVID vaccines are the same as what we do for other vaccines, consumables that we would use would be very similar at high level and in terms of quantities, it is way too early for us to make any judgments on that because we don't know who isn't going to be making which drugs are not going to be the most effective. And there is two types right the prevention side of the equation and the helping patients recover side of the equation and both are under clinical trials right now. It is just unusual for people to begin spending money on production before they know the answer to that question. So, we have a number of people that are spending money for potential production, that may or may not end up manufacturing, the drugs. So, that is the thing to call and some of those people would be our customers, some of those people would not. So it is, I think, at this point, early to call, but having said that, our general expectation is that we will see arise out of that production.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. I'm assuming this is this is a more fragmented areas than Healthcare for you. Were you for your very high market share, you give a lot of different competitors here. Is there a particular vaccine or biologics customer or kind of very - or technology that would have an outsized impact for you that we should be potentially watching?
Walter Rosebrough: I don't know that it is more fragmented than maybe less fragmented. If you step back and call hospitals, or Healthcare systems. There is a lot more health care systems in the country or in the world than there are vaccine producers. So, I wouldn't say that, and I don't think there is any one specific technology that that we would say it would be a step out change for us, versus our General Growth of vaccines. And, the other side of this equation is going to be interesting is, other vaccines, right. I think people are going to get far more sensitive to taking flu vaccines than they used to be. Because, you don't know whether you have flu recovered until you have been tested, right. And so and you certainly don't want both and all those things. So, the question is what is going to happen the vaccines in general, I think right now, vaccines are going to be on the uptake.
Matthew Mishan: And then on the capital equipment. I mean, if I remember correctly that, the lead times on those machines are longer and they are more specialized. When do you think those customers are going to have to putting those orders to ramp up more quickly for that kind of equipment?
Daniel Carestio: This is Dan Carestio. Currently our lead times in GMP equipment depending on the product can extend from 30 days to 7, 8 months, depending on how customized and it may or may not be. And, former customers are continually investing in capacity to stay ahead of it to the extent they can. And so, our backlog will flow through over the next few quarters and our intake of orders remained strong. Sort of the capacity limiting information is not necessarily going to be capital equipment in the short-term though, as it relates to vaccine. It is going to be more production level equipment for production of vaccine as opposed to the sterilization and decontamination equipment.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. Understood. And then last question, as you think about the AST is being a thing positive driver for your capital over last couple of years. I think most people would understand that on the part of the surgical equipment side, how has the ASTs managed their sterilization needs and is that a net positive for you when you see a procedure move from the hospital to and AST?
Walter Rosebrough: In general, the answer is, yes. It is a bit positive. Again, if you go back to the original general statement I made, capital levels changed and of course, uncertainty moving from North to South, cities to suburbs, suburbs to cities, hospitals to [ASCs] (Ph) and ASCs to hospitals, generally creates capital spend, increased capital spend.  Because you don't tear a sterilizer out of a wall, and then stick it in a brand new facility typically, less true of tables, but it is very true of lights and all that. Tables you can move, but if you are two-thirds of the way through with the life, maybe you go ahead and put new tables in this new facility. So generally speaking, any kind of change or movement from one place to another creates capital spend in the spaces that we operate.
Matthew Mishan: Thanks a lot.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions. At this time, we will go ahead and conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference call back over to Miss. Julie Winter for closing remarks. Ma'am.
Julie Winter: Thanks everybody for taking the time out of your morning to be with us today, and we look forward to chatting with all of you soon.
Operator: And we thank you ma'am for your time also today and also to the rest of the management team. Again, the conference call is now ended. At this time you may disconnect your lines. Thank you everyone. Take care and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-05-14 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the STERIS plc Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. As usual, on today's call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO. And I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow, will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available on today's release, along with reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 8%, driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $14 million from tuck-in acquisitions is included in constant currency organic revenue growth, primarily in health care products, spread across capital, consumables and service. Given the timing of our year-end, we were fortunate to have had a relatively limited impact on our business due to COVID-19 during the fourth quarter. We estimate that revenue was negatively impacted by approximately a net $10 million. Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points to 44.4% and was impacted favorably by price, productivity and somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, a decrease of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter last year, due, in part, to an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation related to our strong performance and an increase in R&D spending. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3%. This includes the benefit related to stock compensation expense and other favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 7% to $140.5 million and earnings per share increased to $1.64. I do want to take a moment to discuss our segment changes announced in yesterday's press release. We recently made some key changes to our management structure and reviewed our go-to-market strategy, focusing on our largest customer group health care providers. These changes include realigning the management of our operations to better serve our health care customers. Effective April 1, and consistent with the way management is now operating and viewing the business, the current Healthcare Products and Healthcare Specialty Services segment will be combined and reported as one segment, simply called Healthcare. We have included a recast of quarterly results for fiscal year 2020 in the press release to assist you with your modeling. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $319.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $60.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $50.9 million. Given the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, one of the first steps we took was to pause capital spending where we could during the quarter. Free cash flow for the year exceeded our expectations due to lower-than-planned capital spending and a reduction in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our performance, I would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to the health care providers on the front lines of this pandemic. These are unprecedented times and the challenges facing those caregivers have been unexpected and monumental. I would also like to thank our people, those out in the field and those working behind the scenes in our factories, labs, offices and increasingly from their own homes. They are busy working to support those caregivers with essential products and services. I'm impressed with the way our team has come together during this crisis, helping our customers and each other, fulfilling our mission to create a healthier and safer world. At STERIS, we have a clear, long-term approach to running the business. Our customers come first and are followed closely by our people. If we do our jobs well for those two groups, we believe, we will deliver above-average returns to our shareholders. This philosophy has successfully guided us through several significant challenges over the last decade plus, and we are confident it will see us through this pandemic as well. We have chosen a strategy to focus on what we believe to be growth areas in health care, for procedures, vaccines, biologics. While we are not immune to the downturn in procedures, which we believe to be temporary in nature, we have developed a nice balance to our business in terms of exposure to these areas and a good mix of recurring and capital equipment revenue. Finally, we have employed lean techniques and have been in-sourcing and on-shoring to better protect our product and service supply chains for more than a decade, improving quality, delivery reliability and cost. As a result, we've had a long-term positive run. And so far, our business has fared comparatively well amidst the significant disruption in the global economy. For fiscal 2020, it is safe to say we would be celebrating this phenomenal, record-breaking year we just completed, were it not for the pandemic. We broke the $3 billion revenue mark for the first time, joined the S&P 500, had very strong growth rates in revenue and profitability, ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and would have been looking forward to another record year and repeat of solid growth performance in fiscal 2021. This puts us in an enviable position to face the challenges before us today. Revenue in fiscal 2020 grew 9% as reported and 10% on a constant currency organic basis with solid growth across all segments. This performance was a result of investments we've made in all our businesses as well as the benefit of approximately 100 basis points from small tuck-in acquisitions mostly in health care products. Our AST segment led the pack, growing constant currency organic revenue 15% for the year. As we've discussed all year, this segment has experienced increased demand from our core medical device customers. Demand will be strong in the long run, in our view, and we plan to continue investing in this business in fiscal 2021 and beyond. We currently see continued growth in those AST facilities that process for pharma for PPE like gowns and gloves and for personal use medical devices for the home setting, like insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors. We have, however, begun to see declines in time-deferrable procedure-related devices like orthopedic implants. We expect this to be a relatively short-term phenomenon as health care providers begin doing these procedures again. Healthcare Specialty Services had another outstanding year, growing constant currency organic revenue 12%, despite difficult comparisons with the prior year. We continue to see success across our spectrum of offerings in the U.S. Specific to the fourth quarter, impact of COVID-19, while our outsourced reprocessing business has been impacted by a decline in procedures, our instrument repair business was relatively insulated as many of our customers took advantage of the downtime for more comprehensive maintenance of their instruments. As you might expect, we saw a significant year-over-year decline in the last week or so of March and into April, due to the reduction in nonessential procedures across America. Life Sciences had a better year than anticipated, growing revenue 11% on a constant currency organic basis. Capital equipment sales in this business followed a typical lumpy cadence in fiscal 2020, but our full year growth was 10%, which exceeded our expectations. In consumables, we saw high single to low double-digit growth all year with an upward spike in the fourth quarter, at least, partially due to COVID-19. Some of our pharma customers appear to have stocked up, resulting in 26% growth for the fourth quarter in our Life Science consumables. We've continued to see strong growth in April. But we expect orders to return to a more normalized level in coming months. And finally, Healthcare Products also had a strong year with 7% constant currency organic revenue growth against challenging comparisons to fiscal 2019. Organic growth continues to stem from new products, particularly in our infection prevention capital equipment and consumables franchise. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, this is the segment with the most significant impact from half a dozen or so tuck-in acquisitions this year, which added approximately 200 basis points to our annual growth. Offsetting the acquisitions, Healthcare Products experienced the most immediate revenue loss from COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in endoscopy products. For the fourth quarter, the positive impact of acquisitions, less the COVID-related reductions combined to essentially offset each other in this segment. Adjusted operating margins for total STERIS in fiscal 2020 increased 70 basis points to 20.7%, reflecting improved volume and gross margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the full year were a record $5.65, the high end of our recent expectations and represent 15% growth over fiscal 2019. We are very pleased with these results, which, in addition to our solid balance sheet, position us well for the future. As you've heard from many others, the impact of COVID-19 remains fluid, making forecasting revenue and profit daunting at this time. Where not for the pandemic, we are confident we would have been comfortable at the high-end of our traditional revenue growth rates of 4% to 6% for fiscal 2021. The impact of COVID-19 to STERIS will depend on the linked and severity of the pullback in health care procedures, offset by the areas of our business that are not impacted or are experiencing increased demand. In lieu of quantitative guidance, we will share our qualitative views and expect to revisit guidance as the year progresses. We are fortunate that our business is as diversified as it is across our medical device, pharma and healthcare provider customers, which, we believe, will be a source of strength in the coming months and quarters. Even during the Great Recession of 2008, 2009, our worst fiscal year revenue decline was 3%. And you may recall, we had a few other things going on at that time. That decline was spread over three quarters that happened to be in different fiscal years. If we look at calendar 2009, it contained our four worst consecutive quarters of revenue decline during the downturn. This period combined the health care spending uncertainty of Obamacare beginning with the economic impact of the Great Recession, and our revenue declined about 5% for the year. The preponderance of that decline was in capital equipment, and we were more capital equipment heavy at that time than we are today. As I mentioned earlier, our businesses fared relatively well so far. In the month of March, we experienced modest declines in our Healthcare business, somewhat offset by neutral to positive performance from Life Science and AST. In April, we saw stronger declines in Healthcare with neutral deposit performance again in Life Science and AST. This resulted in a total STERIS revenue decline of less than 10% for April 2020 versus April 2019. On a positive note, we are beginning to see a return of procedures. While we expect this return to be gradual early on, we are encouraged by the discussions we are having with hospital leaders. Similar to others in our space, we anticipate ramping back up to more normalized levels by the end of this calendar year and possibly sooner. Given our financial strength and our expectation that procedure volumes will start to ramp back up in the coming quarter or so, our underutilized people are on standby ready to meet customer needs. We have not instituted layoffs, although some are on short-term paid furloughs. At this point, every one of our people is being paid their basic salary or regular wage for normal working hours, whether they are working full-time or not as long as they are available to work full time. We believe this is the right thing to do at this time and will help us support our customers as they ramp up their procedures to normal levels. We have highly skilled and committed people in our organization, and we want to maintain and grow that skill set. We hope to be able to continue this position until business resumes to more normal levels, but we're taking it week-by-week and will adjust as appropriate. We have taken some actions to protect our near-term cash flow from the slowdown. These include implementing a hiring freeze for most positions, deferring executive wage increases, canceling significant travel events, restricting routine travel and deferring capital expenditures except for strategic growth capital. For the most part, our plants and service operations have been and are running to support our customers. We have had limited shutdowns of some facilities and some are operating below normal capacity. We continue to invest in R&D at our normal levels and intend to continue strategic growth capital spending, particularly in AST and outsourced reprocessing. We continue to believe that these investments will pay off in the intermediate and longer-term. As Mike mentioned, our strong balance sheet remains a strength of the company. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to continue paying dividends and to invest in our businesses to drive anticipated future growth. Our M&A activities have become more selective and deferred due to the lack of visibility for near-term expectations, but we continue to evaluate opportunities. And lastly, share buybacks have been discontinued for now, even those to offset dilution for executive compensation. As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting health care. We are very fortunate to be in the business we're in and to be in a strong financial position. We need to be nimble and ready to support our customers as clinical procedures restart. We are very pleased to be able to provide some relief on the health care front lines with solutions to disinfect hospital respirators during this crisis. We continue working to enhance the long-term value of your company as we balance the short-term impacts of the pandemic with our longer-term opportunities. We believe the future for STERIS is bright, and thank you for all of your continued support. I will now turn the call back over to Julie for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Walt for your comments. Chad, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started on Q&A?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Matt Mishan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Matt Mishan: Great. Thank you and thanks for taking the questions guys. The less than – Walt, the less than 10% decline for April seems like remarkable, given your overall exposures, I just wanted to understand a little bit more around capital equipment and how your – how some of your customers are kind of handling the backlog? Does it reflect like – the backlog was up like 10%, especially in Healthcare Products. Does it reflect orders that have been pushed out, but not shipped? And like how should we be thinking about like new orders over the like the last eight weeks?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. I mean, backlog has been – is, by definition, orders coming in minus shipments going out and plus whatever was already there. So it does reflect all those kind of things. It's very common for us to have last minute pushouts for a couple of weeks or a month because their projects are not coming through on time. Typically, if you think about our capital business in health care, it's divided into what we call turn business or replacement business, where you're just ordering a new table because you want one or because you're other one broke or a new light or something as opposed to a project where they're renovating a major section of the operating room or central sterile department. And typically, that's a 60-40 split, 60% turn or replacement business and 40% project type business. We've seen this several times whenever hospitals become a bit uncertain on capital, the projects actually, if the steel is in the ground, keep moving forward because once in – the steel is in the ground, they need to finish the project. It costs them too much to slow down or stop. On the other hand, the turn business tends to slow down a little bit until they get more visibility to what is going on. And so that's a typical thing that happens in an economic slowdown for hospitals, not necessarily the general economy, but the health care economy. We saw that – well, we've seen it many, many times when the hospital is under some kind of financial constraint or financial pressure. If anything, we would expect to see something similar. We have not seen that to date. We've not seen significant pushouts, significant – cancellations are super rare. We haven't seen any cancellations. And actually, orders have replicated last year for the last couple of months. So we have not seen a change in order pattern. Having said that, since our reps can't talk to hospital people face-to-face these days, I would anticipate seeing an order slowdown here in the next month or two or three, it takes time for orders to occur. But the question is, what's the magnitude of that slowdown? And the good news is we had extraordinary backlog, as you said. So at this point, we can produce the backlog, assuming those orders don't shift significantly, because they usually do not. We're in pretty good shape for a couple of months after that, then we depend more on the incoming orders. And we don't have a great deal of visibility to that yet. And hospitals, in a period of uncertainty, there's been a lot more time worrying about how to handle the COVID pandemic right now than what their capital equipment orders are in the next couple of weeks.
Matt Mishan: Okay. That’s great there. And then just shifting over to the AST dynamics. I think you're clearly outpacing industry volumes. I'm just trying to understand are OEMs moving away from in-sourcing the service, given the regulatory environment? And then also, I think, one of the comments that struck me, I always thought this was more of a med device sterilization business. Can you break down the difference between med device and pharma exposure in AST?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. It – you stated it correctly. It is a med device business that happens to also do some pharma and some other things. But the preponderance of the business is med device. But med devices have various roles. Again, a big, big piece of it are things like hip replacements and knee replacements and the implants for replacements, I should say, and for pacemakers and things like that. So there's a big piece, as you might expect, are implantable devices, and that's because they have to be sterile if they're implanted. Having said that, there are other components, we generally don't spend a lot of time talking about, but there are other components that kind of travel with those big pieces normally, that is surgical gowns and masks and things like that, that may need to be sterile. And the sterile versions, we do process those as well. Now in a normal environment, that travels kind of consistently with procedures, as you might expect. Right now, gowns and gloves and masks are not traveling with procedures, are traveling with COVID. And so we're getting – what I would characterize as extraordinary demand increase in those spaces. And that's where we see the split, the people doing that. And then also things like the diabetic supplies and other things that are more home-based, they're still medical devices, but they are more home-based medical devices, chronic devices, if you will, as opposed to procedural devices. Those devices are also seeing a little bit – I think it's consumer pull-forward. If you're diabetic, you're anxious about making sure you have supplies at a time when there's a lot of things that are not very sure. And so I think we're seeing some pull-forward of people stocking up a bit in diabetic supplies, whether they will continue that stock-up or how they use it downward, if you will, is unclear. And then, of course, that space is just a rapidly growing space anyway because the innovation that diabetes companies have had in terms of monitoring the – monitoring and having the closed-loop insulin system. So that space is a fast-growing space anyway, and now it's a little bit faster because of people stocking up a bit.
Matt Mishan: Okay. And then last one for me. Can you just illustrate how STERIS can support like a ramp in vaccine production? What products in Life Sciences would be supportive of that? And how you could potentially shift manufacturing capacity?
Dan Carestio: Yes, sure. This is Dan Carestio. And what I would say is, in Life Sciences, our products, in particular, around our consumable offering is highly focused on maintaining aseptic environments. And that type of offering lends itself very well to vaccine production. It's one of the areas that we had focused on historically, continue to focus on and we stand ready to help our pharma customers as they look to ramp up to ensure that they can do that production in the proper aseptic manufacturing environments.
Matt Mishan: All right. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Chris Cooley: Good morning, and appreciate you taking the questions. Congratulations on the record year. Just two for me. Walt or Michael, if you want to maybe address the combination of the Healthcare Products and the HSS division. I'm just curious if you could give us some additional detail there, how we should think about that combined entity going forward ex COVID-19 from both a growth and a margin profile, assuming that there's some benefits that you anticipate on getting there? So I would like to get some color on that front. And I'll just go ahead and throw my second question in now as well. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to being comfortable ex COVID-19 with the high end of the historical growth range of 4% to 6% in terms of organic revenue growth. I would appreciate just some color about the components of that. And in particular, maybe some emphasis on the AST segment. There's been a lot of debate whether that can actually sustain high single-digit type growth. So just kind of curious if you could add some color around that, again, independent of COVID-19? Thank you.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Chris, and appreciate the comments about the year. First, on the organizational side, as – I have mentioned several times that as we started doing this work in America, we found out that it doesn't – and not surprisingly, doesn't work exactly as it does in the U.K. And so we've continued to experiment, and we have a number of different approaches to the market that we've been working with and many of those, the people, who are in our IPT business, which serve the same set of customers, are extraordinarily useful in bringing together. Also, as you might expect, if we're running the CSDs, they typically have STERIS equipment and STERIS products in them. And so the integration of that product set we thought was worthwhile. So all of that business is now under – in term – the commercial side of that business is now under the same individual who handles the historic STERIS capital consumables business in North America and the same is true in the rest of the world. So we've combined the commercial operations around the world. And we do believe we gain – actually, we transfer the STERIS credibility from – at the commercial level, at the working commercial level. Now they're still different sales forces and still different local management groups. But they're all under the Commercial Head. And we've actually moved some of the products amongst the businesses in terms of the business unit leaders to get them in the appropriate places. And so it's just now a very much combined set of businesses. And as a result, it's harder and harder to know where the revenue and profits really coming from and really going to. So we felt it was logical to combine those businesses, both organizationally and the way we are managing customers. And it's all the same customers that if you look at our three businesses, we have historically continued to organize backwards from customer in. So our Life Science business is organized around largely pharmaceutical, also research. Our AST business is organized around med devices and our Healthcare business is organized around med devices and our Healthcare business is organized around hospitals and ambulatory surgeries wherever they take place. And so that's the logic. And even the historic U.S. business of IMS, we call IMS and have called Healthcare Specialty Services, that was kind of two basic product lines made up most of the business, the one being the outsourced resource – outsourced reprocessing centers, outsourced CSDs, if you will, and the instrument repair. And the instruments being repaired are a lot of the same type of businesses – or instruments that are in U.S. endoscopy like, and so there's interface between those. So not only is that true of the ORC-type businesses, but it's also true of the endoscopy-type product line. So we have put those together. I don't know that we will see radical changes in cost. This is not a cost reduction move. There may be some minor opportunities, but really it's about continuing to ramp up of the efficiency of the revenue generation in those businesses that we're after. So I think that's pretty much the answer to the first question. Again, that's now – we did that a couple of months ago or three months ago now maybe, and it is a global organization, very smooth. It's not a lot of change in people or change in management structure. It's just the way that they are reporting up through those businesses now. Your second question was – I've now forgotten since I answered the first one. Do you mind give me a quick help?
Chris Cooley: No, happy to. That was – I appreciate all the detail there. Again, just in your prepared comments, you alluded to, ex COVID-19, you would have been comfortable with the 4% to 6% organic growth range, the historical range, but at the higher end of that range. Just was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit of color around the components that would drive you towards the upper end of the range with a little bit of emphasis on the AST franchises. As you know, there's been a lot of debate about the sustainability, at least, in the shorter-term of the kind of historical high single-digit organic growth in that franchise based upon the tougher comp in the year. Thank you.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. Thanks, Chris, for the reminder. Like I said, we are confident. We built our business plan pre-COVID. And so we are not only confident, we are sure we are thinking about numbers in the high end of that range. And so very, very comfortable there. And specific to AST, as you have seen AST continuing to perform both in March and April for the quarter and going into April, we are quite comfortable that it would have been on the leading edge, if you will, or the higher edge of the businesses. We've been saying that for some time now. We still think there's a runway for those higher single-digit kind of numbers going forward absent COVID. Now COVID throws everything up in the air. So I would not begin to estimate what our growth rate would be in AST for this year. But as we come out of COVID, we feel comfortable that we're in a strong position. To do that, first of all, the device businesses are doing nicely. And secondly, as we've said before, because a lot of this, I'll call it, supply uncertainty question that was going on even prior to the COVID and certainly now post, I think you will see people that, all things being equal, would rather have a relationship with someone who can move things from plant to plant to plant inside their organization as opposed to having to move things from plant A to plant B to plant C that are crossing other people. So – and as I've said this before, I think companies like STERIS, and there are other companies that have multiple plants, I think, they will be in a stronger position given some of the supply chain things that have occurred in the last six to 12 months, I think we're even in a stronger position than we were before.
Chris Cooley: Thank you. Stay well.
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Dave Turkaly: Yes, congrats on the year. It was refreshing to get the release last night and see that minimal impact because it's certainly a lot different than your peers. So congrats there. Two quick ones for me. You mentioned in HSS, you're adding capacity. I was wondering if you could give us a little color on exactly what your plans are? And then in Healthcare Products, you mentioned R&D up 11%. I was wondering if you could just highlight a couple of programs and what kind of investments you're making there, too? Thanks.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, a couple of responses. We are particularly shy about – talking about future products and future investments, in general. We can – we're happy to talk about them in generalized specifics, we're probably a little shy. But we continue the product portfolio enhancements that we have done across the business. And we're in the double-digit new products every year in our Healthcare business for a long time now, and I don't see that stopping. So we just think a continuation of that product development stream is a good thing. And it's – the same basic types of products that we provide today. So it's not a – that's not something like a whole new division or anything coming out, but it's just more and more products, some of which are new and some of which are enhancements of our current product lines. So we just will be continuing that and if anything upping the ante. The second area in the HSS business, as I mentioned, we found that there are more than one way to skin a cat in the U.S. versus the UK version. So we have multiple types of thoughts around how we might help our customers with outsourced ORC-type capabilities. And those all require investment because unless we are just going into their facility and operating it, which is a rarer case, we need to be adding capacity. That's the real issue. Whether it is constant capacity or peak capacity or other types of capacity adds, we need to be adding capacity, and that takes capital investment. So that's what we're talking about. And it's largely, to say, outsourced ORC add, but you have to think about that in kind of its broadest context, that's the capacity we'd be adding.
Dave Turkaly: Thank you.
Walt Rosebrough: You bet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Larry Keusch: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. For – I guess for Walt and perhaps, Mike, could you talk a little bit – I just want to come back to sort of what you were seeing in April. And so I was wondering if you could come back and give us some flavors for the various business segments, how those were behaving in April versus March to get you to that sort of wrapped up sort of 10% decline versus a year ago as you talked about? And I'm assuming that, that includes some of the pull-forward dynamics that you talked about. And then I had a second question after that.
Dan Carestio: Yes, sure. This is Dan Carestio. And what I would say is between the three businesses, in AST, things were pretty much neutral to slight growth with sort of offsetting puts and takes between COVID-related products and highly elective procedure products being down. The Life Sciences business was up significantly coming off of a strong backlog and equipment and extremely high demand, as it relates to our disinfectants and chemistries around cleaning. And some of that's pull-forward, we don't anticipate it being sustained. And then in general, in terms of our Healthcare business on capital, those were already planned shipments coming through. We haven't seen any cancellations. And it was normal shipping for the most part early on anyway in terms of our consumable lines. And those have now slowed a bit, but generally speaking, that's the essence [ph].
Larry Keusch: Okay. And just to clarify, Dan, the pull-forward, again, that you talked about, for example, in diabetes, in AST, again, I assume that was sort of all wrapped into that 10% number you were talking about for the business as a whole?
Dan Carestio: That's right. Yes. Yes. And in terms of those products in AST, like I said, it's kind of puts and takes that got them to about neutral.
Larry Keusch: Okay. And then I guess just around one of the things I've been thinking a lot about is clearly, hospitals are going to be in a very challenged financial position coming out of this. We're all acutely aware of the negative mix shift that goes along with treating a COVID patient versus losing a surgical procedure. And it certainly feels like capital spending is going to be under a significant pressure here for, I mean, it could be six, 12 months, who knows. But when do you start to see or start to get some visibility on kind of how that may impact your business? It sounds like, as Walt indicated, you haven't had a lot of discussions yet. Your reps obviously aren't in the hospitals. Hospitals have been focused on treating COVID patients and putting other things aside at this point. But when do you start to really get a flavor for how this may start to shake out in the coming months here?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. Larry, we've seen this movie or at least I've seen this movie lots of time since 1982. When hospitals get put under pressure, the general move is they continue to buy the things they were going to buy, if you will, that were already on the docket. They will put in a capital freeze and just not unlike we do. We put in a capital freeze, but it's a freeze, but it's not a freeze. If they're in the middle of building a hospital, they're going to build it. If they think it's strategic, they're going to do the strategic builds. And then they slow down the replacements. Now when stuff breaks, they got to have it. So that will – they still – it's not like replacements stop completely. They just slow down. 2008, 2009 is a great example. In 2008, 2009, we have the combination, as I mentioned of the Obamacare uncertainty and capital abhors uncertainty. And so there was a lot of uncertainty. And then right behind it, the debt window for short-term debt froze up, and many of the hospitals had financed their long-term financing with short-term debt because it was very inexpensive to do so. And literally, they didn't have the cash. And so exactly what I've described happened. They put on – in general, they put on some capital freezes. It slowed down a bit for a while. Usually, what happens is it's like truly frozen for a month or two, that's okay because we go through the backlog and then they start releasing the things they really need, it slows down a bit. So I would think in the next six or eight months, we would see the impact and begin to have better visibility to the pipeline. Right now, our pipeline visibility for the last four, five weeks has been pretty much negligible because there's nothing really going on. Those conversations are not happening right now, except for give me the stuff I've already – I've anticipated putting in place in my hospital. So the next time we talk, I suspect we'll be able to talk about pipeline.
Larry Keusch: Okay, great. And I guess I'll just sneak one more and just quickly on the longer term view. Given any lessons learned from this pandemic, how do you think about investment into AST? Clearly, I understand that you've got an investment plan in front of you and you've been executing against that. But do you think about it differently now? Do you need to sort of perhaps scale up more EO capacity than you've had in the past? Just again, kind of, thinking about as we come out at the other end of this, what may change for you guys as you think about investment spending?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. Larry, as you know, we're pretty bullish in this space. And we like our competitive position for the reasons I've described. We have a very broad array of technologies. And we have the ability to help customers if something happens in one of their plants and they needed to go to a different plant or if something happens in one of our plants and it needs to go to a different plant, we think that's a good place to be. And the same with technologies, to the extent you can move across technologies, we have the ability to do that. So we like the business. We think our plan is a solid one for the future growth of that space, and we don't see a whole lot of reason to be backing off of it. We're pleased to have the capital position that we have. At this moment in time, the only reason we'll spend less capital in that business is because it's – we can't get permits and things like that because the governments are effectively closed. They're doing other things besides permitting, building permits and things like that. So that – and/or construction companies not being able to provide labor or whatever, I mean, we want to do it on the schedule, we were doing it. We see no reason to be stopping. It takes us two years from the time we start to the time we can turn on the gas. We don't see any reason to be stopping gas right now. In terms of shifting among modalities, I think we have that pretty well scoped out. And I don't believe we have any great reason to change what our current plans were. But we'll be watching that, of course. We've continued to add capacity in EO in the last 12 months or so and going forward. And the bulk of that has been outside the U.S. just because that's where the business was, not because of any other reason. And we will continue to beef up that space as well as the various radiation modalities.
Larry Keusch: Okay, terrific. Thanks for the response. Appreciate it.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us today. Stay healthy and stay well.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-02-11 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the STERIS plc Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All participant will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. As usual, on today’s call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant-currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow, will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions is available in today’s release, including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 12%, driven by volume and 60 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $13 million or 180 basis points is included in constant currency organic revenue growth for the quarter from the eight tuck-in acquisitions we completed this fiscal year. Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 43.1% and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and mix somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.1% of revenue, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter last year, despite an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation due to our strong performance and a 9% increase in R&D expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20%. Net income in the quarter grew 16%, to $124 million and earnings increased to $1.45 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth and margin expansion. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $199.2 million of cash and $1.1 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $55.5 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. Free cash flow for the first nine months declined as anticipated to $238.1 million, primarily due to the planned increase in capital spending. Our capital expenditures have been lower through the first three quarters of the year, due to the timing of capital projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending to $240 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $340 million. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. As you've already heard, our third quarter continued the trend of outperformance we've seen in the last several quarters. We experienced solid growth across all of our segments and in total delivered double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter exceeding our expectations. Our healthcare specialty service segment has significantly stronger quarter than we anticipated, driven by double-digit growth in the repair business and continued contributions from new outsourced reprocessing centers coming online. Margins in this segment were impacted somewhat by startup costs for outsource reprocessing centers and personnel cost to support future growth. Lifescience also outperformed in the quarter with good growth in consumables and a record level of capital equipment shipments, even with the strong shipments, our increased capital orders allowed us to end the quarter with record backlog levels in Lifescience. AST continued its outstanding revenue performance this year, growing 15% on a constant currency organic revenue basis for the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from our core medical device customers around the world. And lastly, Healthcare Products delivered a solid quarter with particular strength in consumables. We continue to benefit from our new consumable products as well as recently acquired businesses. Our service maintenance revenue has grown too and was augmented by installation revenue due to the strong capital shipments in the first half of the year. Based on our performance, year-to-date, and expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again revising our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of approximately 9% for fiscal 2020, up from the prior 7.5% to 8.5% range. This increase is due to outperformance in the third quarter. Our expectations for the fourth quarter reflect difficult year-over-year comparisons. Recall that our prior year Q4 constant currency organic revenue growth was 9%. In particular, we expect capital equipment to be roughly flat across the businesses in Q4. In Healthcare Products, which makes up the bulk of our capital equipment revenue, we have very difficult comparisons against the strong fourth quarter last year. As we've mentioned in the past, we continue our efforts to level our capital shipments and avoid fourth quarter spikes. Given the strength we have seen so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be at the high end of our $5.50 to $5.65 range. As a result, we continue to expect another year of record performance in 2020. We believe the short-term and long-term future for STERIS is bright and we appreciate your ongoing support. Now, before we open to Q&A, I would like to comment on coronavirus. As you probably know, China is a relatively small piece of STERIS' global revenue. So, we don't anticipate any material impact to revenue from the coronavirus as a result of China sales this fiscal year. On the supply chain side, although the situation is fluid, we are in regular communication with our Chinese suppliers. At this time, we believe we should be able to mitigate any issues that may arise, so there are no material impacts to revenue due to the supply chain issues this fiscal year as well. We are in contact with our customers to understand how the situation is impacting them and what we can do to help. We're also in contact with our people and are deeply concerned for their health and safety. Our China operations have been closed since the Lunar New Year, except for limited operations to support critical products and we will continue to follow the guidance of the Government and do what is best for our people like. Like most businesses, we have restricted travel to and from China across the company. With that, we are happy to take any questions you may have. Julie, can you open the call for Q&A please?
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike for your comments. Gary, if you would please give the instructions so we can get started with Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Dave Turkaly: Good morning. Thank you. Walt, one for you off the bat here. If 1Q was a hot quarter, I'd love to ask you, what you call this quarter?
Walt Rosebrough: Pretty darned.
Dave Turkaly : So, to get into a serious question here, but again, there was no one-time impact right, there was no extra days or anything like that. You called out the pricing, but, and I think the M&A side had a little contribution. But overall, no other one-time impacts in the quarter, correct?
Walt Rosebrough: I wouldn't characterize any of the impacts of the quarter being abnormal.
Dave Turkaly : Great. And I guess, if we look at those deals that you mentioned, I think you said, I think you said eight, I guess any color on them where they fall in? You mentioned the contribution, but I guess it might be nice to know what things you've added even though they're relatively small versus your base? Thanks a lot.
Walt Rosebrough: Sure, Dave. We're not going to get into details of that. As we mentioned, the bulk of the revenue this year is coming-in in the Hospital Products business or Healthcare Products business. It's actually smattered around the various units in that business, none of which are consequential. Does add a point and a half or so of revenue in the quarter. And our best estimate is about a point for the year overtime. So again, there's nothing here that's particularly material in the short-run. There's a couple of them we think may be for instance in the long run, but we'll hold that until we see how they work out.
Dave Turkaly : Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Cooley with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Chris Cooley: Good morning. Just two from me. Really solid from top to bottom, both in terms of growth and the leverage. I guess just a couple things do wanted to get our hands a little bit better around and specifically when we look at Healthcare Products, you had a really strong year-over-year increase in consumables. I'd like to understand a little bit more about what drove that and then why, I guess the offset that, why we didn't see more margin expansion with that level of growth and that percentage contribution in Healthcare Products coming from consumables within the broader category there from the segment margin. I've just got one more follow up after that. Thanks.
Mike Tokich: Yeah, Chris. It's Mike. In the consumables, a portion of that growth is actually from some of the acquisitions that we just completed.
Chris Cooley : Okay.
Mike Tokich : It's about $8 million to $10 billion or something of that nature, Julie, right? Yeah, for the quarter, $8 million to $10 million of impacts, favorable impact obviously on the revenue side from some of the acquisitions we just completed. 
Walt Rosebrough: The other point, Chris, as we mentioned, our service part of consumables as we look at it and service profitability is not as strong on an ROS basis, as is the chemistry-type products and endoscopy type products. And so, that had more of an averaging effect. It looks more like capitals. Obviously on an ROE base, it's pretty good because of very little capital, but on an ROS basis, it's strong. 
Chris Cooley : Certainly. And then, I guess just lastly for me, as we look ahead beyond the remainder of this fiscal year, it seems to be a hot topic out there right now about capacity AST, could you just kind of maybe walk us through where you are in general terms from a capacity perspective, thoughts on incremental CapEx and just how you can see that business growing from longer-term perspective? Thanks so much.
Walt Rosebrough: Sure, Chris. I'll let Mike talk about CapEx. But at a high level, obviously our ethylene oxide plants are pretty full right now and they've had increased pressure if you will of [furnace]. It has moved from U.S. to overseas as we're now processing some things that would normally have processed in Americas, overseas. So, they're giving more full. Having said that, we continued to add capacity. And so, there's two ways we add, one is by adding facilities or growing the number of chambers inside the facilities. The other is, being more efficient lean approaches inside those facilities, and we're doing both. So, although we are, a more full than normal on the ethylene oxide type facilities. We continue to grow the ability to grow, if you will. By the same token on the radiation side, we can also continue to grow our ability to grow, and there we've talked about a number of plants that are being built or added or opened across our global network and we're doing so in a very technology-neutral approach, that is we're adding EBM technology, we're adding x-ray technology, and we're adding capacity in the global facilities. So, we do see that as the approach. We clearly see greater growth in the EBM and x-ray type facilities than any of the others actually. And so, that's where we're placing our money. Mike, why don't you talk about CapEx?
Mike Tokich: Yeah. Chris, at the beginning of the year, our view was, we were going to spend about a $100 million in gross CapEx AST alone. Obviously that number has come down a little bit because of just the timing of projects. And I think we have about eight recent projects that are being worked on that we've announced. Our view would be, it's just a timing issue. So, next year I would, look at CapEx being probably at that elevated level once again, and maybe even for the next year or two after that. Obviously with the growth that we're seeing from our customers for a medical device industry. We need to continue to add capacity to maintain the current growth.
Walt Rosebrough: And I would say, I mean as I've talked about a lot, we seen the medical device business growing. We're in the middle of the baby-boom right now, and the baby-boomers are largely entering, the biggest part of the baby-boomers entering the high healthcare spending years and things like orthopedic implants and stents and all those good medical devices to improve our lives get used a lot more when you're 65 and 70 and 75 than when you're 45 and 50 and 55. So, we see a sustained growth for our customers on the unit volume at least for the foreseeable future, and that creates sustained growth for our AST business as well as our hospital business or healthcare business. But, I would add that, given our global network, it is I think easier and easier for global type companies to work with someone like us who has a broad coverage. We can move from plant A to plant B if they need to for whatever reason. And also, they can count on a single quality system and single regulatory system. So, I do think that is helpful for us to grow a bit faster than the market.
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. 
Matthew Mishan: You mentioned that results were ahead of expectations. You've had two straight quarters that are consistent like this. Just curious, what in particular is surprising you about the sustainability of these trends?
Walt Rosebrough: Well, I guess, Matt, I'll answer in four or five years if they should stay. I'll feel even more strongly about the sustainability. But, you know, a lot of the things that we have been working on seem to be coming together right now. So, if you walk through and we talked about the nice growth in the Healthcare Services business, both the equipment repair business is growing nicely as we've added and continue to add capacity, the outsource solutions, as I've mentioned before, we think it's going to look at this different kind of the Americas than it looks in UK. And I think we're getting better at understanding that model and providing what our customers want and need. So, that business has a pretty good growth rate. We think, the Lifescience business has continued kind of its long-term growth rate on the chemistry side, maybe slightly off of some of the faster years, but still a solid growth in that business. And vaccines and biologics, we think is a good space to be in and that's where we are. On the AST side, I think I've already talked about that, but we think that is a good grower and on the Healthcare sides of business, again, we continue to add a product to our portfolio. We continue to refine our sales approaches, and again, particularly, I thought the industrialized countries, we're facing, the middle of the baby-boom coming through and that's going to be like a pig through a python in my opinion for the next 10 to 15 years. So, underlying market demand is good and we're doing our jobs to pick up at least our fair share of that.
Matthew Mishan: Alright. And then, how have your conversations evolved with the major healthcare systems, especially with your scale? I'm just trying to understand how interconnected some of the growth is across businesses like Healthcare Products and Healthcare Specialty services. Are they looking at you differently and trying to consolidate more business with you?
Walt Rosebrough: Matt, that's an excellent question. The answer to your question is yes, yes. We are clearly seeing more interconnection between the Healthcare Service business and the Healthcare Products business. In some respects, one is the customer of the other, and so, oftentimes, when we're looking at things, we're able to talk to the hospitals about what their needs are in healthcare systems and what their needs are. And, for one, it might be, I'll add a little more to the CST that I have, the other one may say, I'll add some more, but can you take over some, another might say, gee, we'd like you to run our ORC. But we still need to have turn centers in our ambulatory surgery centers. I mean, it is a, they are evolving their business model in this space and having the full spectrum of products and services across that space does put us in a different position to give them what they want independent, what we might think is the best thing.  And so, it's like most of the things we do. We work hard to be technology-neutral, approach-neutral. I have a broad spectrum of things that we can offer our customer and let them choose which pieces of the spectrum they want.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. That's really helpful color. Could you also give us an update on the ORC model? You're talking about that a little bit more now? I think you previously quoted like $50 million on business on three contracts. Have those at least launched and are running as expected?
Walt Rosebrough: We don't talk about specific ones. We have now more centers up. I don't know that we're going to give those numbers, but we have more centers. I know we're not going to give locations and talk about our customers, but we have more centers up, some of them are more like micro centers, some of them are more like larger centers. But, the numbers we have quoted for our growth forecast for the ORCs, we continued to exceed those, which is a part of the reason HSS has beaten our expectations.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then last question. And it is a multi-part question. So just warning you in advance. I thought you guys did at the FDA panel, I thought you did an excellent job. I thought you did an excellent job. I thought you guys were clearly the adult in the room, because we're asking followup questions on sustainably. Like, how long would it take to switch practices from traditionally-owed to sustainably-owed facility? You know, what is the incremental costs of implementing that at a medium size facility? Does it require new equipment and like what would be the cost savings of using like less EO?
Walt Rosebrough: I'm going to work backwards on your question, Matt. It costs nothing in the facilities and does not require any consequential change to equipment, gas, whatever. So, that is a non-cost item. It does cost our customers and us working together. We have to re-validate the fact that the process, which uses oftentimes half the gas, that the traditional processes use, it does, we have to make sure we know we're using less gas so we don't have to validate that part of the question. We know there will be less ethylene, so we know that's not an issue. But, we also know the FDA pays particular attention to how much residual gas stays in the product. So, if it gets implanted into the patient, that's okay, but we know that's better, because we're starting out with less gas. So, all those things are known. We just need to be absolutely positively sure that we are sterilizing the device, when we do that, and that requires validation by the customers and us. We are working with it. It also currently or historically requires the agency to look at it and approve it. We are working with the agency to lay out templates to make that far simpler for our customers and far less of a regulatory burden for our customers to be able to do that. So, I'll call it the switching cost and switching cost is all around validation, than any other I'll call it material costs. Now obviously it uses a little less gas, that cost is largely immaterial in the process. So, as the Delta in the gas usage is relatively immaterial. And frankly, in most cases, our total cost is immaterial those are the transportation costs in the process. So, this is not a big cost issue. It is a get it right issue, and both we and our customers are very serious to make sure that in enhancing what's potentially the environment that we do not take any risks that the product is not sterile.  Right now, we're, I'm going to use the world an oxymoron today in many cases. We're over sterilizing now. Once you kill all the bugs, you can't kill them again. So, we're over gassing and not really over sterilizing. And to the extent, we're over gassing, we don't need to do. It does, it takes time, but it's not measured in months for any specific customer to name a specific product. But there's a lot of customers and a lot of products up there. So, it will take STERIS years we believe. But, we do think and Mr. Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer who grew up in that business, absolutely believes and set a target for his team to get down 50%, using half the gas we used to use for the same level of requirements and do that inside of 5 years and we think we can hit those targets.
Matthew Mishan: All right. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congratulations to you all for your success, even Mike.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Larry Keusch: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Walt, just wanted to start with you. Obviously, this fiscal year-to-date has been really outstanding both in revenue generation and margin expansion. I'm just wondering, as we all start to think about fiscal '21 and I recognize you're not providing guidance, but can you help us to think about any sort of puts and takes that we should be considering for both as we sort of look at revenues and margins for next year?
Walt Rosebrough: Larry, as you have said, we're not giving guidance, right now. And I know in some respects that, that can be frustrating for you guys because most companies are calendar year companies and we're a quarter behind the calendar year. So, as a result we're a quarter late versus calendar year kind of a projections. So we have not, we're in our planning processes. We have not concluded those processes. As I mentioned, the Chinese thing, there is a little fluidity there. But you know, I will say a couple of things to think about, A, we are starting from very nice growth rates, right? We're approaching double-digits for the year, 9%, that gives us a tough comps but the flip side is, last year we started out with uncertainties in device tax, uncertainties in labor rates, uncertainties in trade for us trade is North America more than China. So, the trade uncertainties in terms of NAFTA, and Brexit and last year, we did have some tough comps in Q4 which again, we have tough comps this year in Q4. So, if you, if you look all through that, at a high level, we think about this business for the markets we're in to be in kind of a 4% to 6% constant currency grower, and hopefully we get a our sort of share, and you never know exactly when and how that's going to happen. Hopefully, we get a little price. Hopefully we get, a couple of acquisitions and the next thing you know, we're in those high single-digits. We're pretty comfortable right now with where we sit, that we will be toward the high-end of that 4% to 6% rates in our constant currency growth rates. Again, we haven't done our final analysis. We will obviously talk more about that in three months, but we're feeling pretty good about the high side.
Larry Keusch : And I would assume, again, some more thoughts around margins and then there's a reason to think that margins wouldn't expand going forward.
Walt Rosebrough : As you know, Larry, I'm not the margin expansion guy. I'm the margin growing guy. I like to grow profit dollars, but I don't have any reason to believe. I am absolutely confident, we will be working to improve our cost position. We will choose on what to do in terms of how we handle that in terms of lack of price increase or price increase. We definitely are facing a little headwind on the labor side. The labor rates are clearly going up. But you know, when we put all that together, we don't see any reason to be off our normal paths.
Larry Keusch : Okay. One more bigger picture and then I just have a couple of quick ones for perhaps for Mike. But, as you think about the next steps within the sterilization regulatory pathway, could you bring us up to speed sort of what you think the EPA will ultimately wind up doing as it comes out with this. Its recommendations and then, you know, clearly the States of Georgia and Illinois have been challenging, really more from a local government perspective, and I guess that's always the concern. But how do you think about, are there any States where you guys are operating where local government could start to become more of an issue in operation in these types of facilities?
Walt Rosebrough : You know Larry, forecasting what governments are going to do is a little like forecasting elections. And I don't really think we have any great knowledge on that. I will say, and I mentioned that last time, we have been impressed with the way the FDA has taken this bull by the horns and knowing that there is 50 some odd percent of the devices are sterilized by ethylene oxide, that need to be sterile. And so, it's very important to them to keep those supply chains moving. And I think they're doing a superb job of working on that. The EPA, and particularly because, the FDA and the Secretary of Health have made it clear, the risks the country takes on, we cannot sterilize with ethylene oxide in the intermediate-term. I think they would have done a nice job, but I think they are doing, taking a nice methodical approach. It would be very easy for them to make a snap judgment, but from what we see, the way they've requested information, the way they are asking all types of players in this space, you know, the manufacturers, the devices, those who sterilize and those who are concerned about those issues in the environment. By the way, we're in two of those, well, we're all three of those three buckets. So, we were concerned about the environment. We're concerned about sterilization. We're concerned about a device manufacturing, being a device manufacturer. So it seems to me they're taking a very-balanced approach to this process. We do feel, our own opinion is, we feel that we're at the high-end of the industry in terms of the way we handle things. Our move toward sustainability a couple of years ago now, certainly led the industry and we're clearly seeing people being very interested in that approach now.  We also know about, know the design of our facilities and the way we handle the gas and the way we remediate the gases at the high-end or the, I'll call it the good end of the industry. So, we are very comfortable that we have been in and are safe for our people and our communities. But that doesn't mean, we can rest on our laurels. We intend to get safer and safer, which is why we do this 50% reduction, and we're always looking at the way that we handle the gas inside and outside of the facilities, and we'll continue to do so. And by the way, that's not just a comment about the United States, that's comment about the world. We are not assuming that the only people that care about ethylene oxide gas are Americans. And so, you know, that that's our approach. We're comfortable, as comfortable one can get, I guess, because you can always have something occur. You are correct. In my own view, the bigger risk in short run at least is the local and state governments. But, I do think now that it's very clear that, both the FDA and the EPA are engaged, there's more likelihood that people will wait and see what that result is. And then based on that result, we'll take appropriate actions. 
Larry Keusch : Okay. Very good. And then, for Mike, just wanted to think a little bit about the investments within HFS. You know, the operating margin of that is trended down over the past three quarters. I think it's 10.7% this quarter, on an operating margin basis from 14.6% in the fourth quarter of '19. So, just again I want to make sure I'm understanding the investments, it seems pretty straightforward, but just to make sure we're understanding that and then what's the right way to think about, again, margins for this business going forward. And then the second question Mike is, you've talked about a 100 basis points or so of growth being added by M&A this year. What is the threshold for when you kind of pull that out of organic growth? Because, you still characterize it as organic, constant currency growth, but there's a 100 basis points in there from M&A. So, just trying to understand what the threshold is. Thanks.
Mike Tokich: Yes, certainly Larry. I'll answer the second question first. Typically what we do is when we do any type of, I'll call it material acquisition, we would separate that out and actually disclose that separately so that we are not in this, the boat that we're in today, where we're trying to call out or cuts organic revenue growth, and then also note at the same point in time what the acquisitions added. So, unfortunately this year, doing 8 acquisitions that were all individually immaterial, but if you aggregate them all together, they become material. So, that's the reason we chose the way we want to disclose that this year is make sure that everybody understands that the impact and there's a pretty significant impact on the third quarter, 180 basis points in the quarter for constant currency organic revenue growth, but, it is understood and we're being as transparent as possible. We don't like going down that path, obviously. We would prefer to do an acquisition and separate that out and go back to our historical reporting, but this year is an anomaly hopefully. But again, with 8 acquisitions combined being in the combination of all being relative we have to do something so that we're again, truly being transparent.
Walt Rosebrough: And just to be clear on that, when Mike says we don't like that, but he's talking the accounting issues, not the businesses. We like those businesses. We love tuck-in businesses. If I can do 10 more next year, that look like these eight we will do 10 more next year, we'll be talking about this again, I suspect. But, it's not that we don't like the businesses.
Mike Tokich: We just don't like the reporting of it.
Walt Rosebrough: We don't want to be changing our constant currency growth rate every month, because of some small businesses really the issue, that's the point.
Mike Tokich: And then your first question regarding the HSS business. Obviously, as Walt mentioned in his script that, we did have a start up costs for the new ORCs and in addition to that, we are continuing to have people cost to support the future growth in HSS. I mean, our long term view of this business is still mid-teens. We haven't come off of that. Obviously, you are seeing the benefit of the revenue, the top-line growth, but it does come with a little bit of startup costs, which we've talked about for two years now in a row, and as we bring facilities online, it probably takes roughly 12, maybe 18 months depending on the size of the facility to get to breakeven, and then start actually adding profit to that business. So, it's not unusual, and it's not a surprise to us by any means.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks everybody for joining us again this morning. Hope you have a great day.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2019-11-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Steris plc Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All participant will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As usual, on today’s call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of Steris is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those risk factors described in Steris’ securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Steris’ SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today’s call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant-currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow, will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in today’s release, including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant-currency organic revenue growth was 10% driven by volume and 90 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. Gross margin for the quarter increased 150 basis points to 43.6% and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 20.3% of revenue, an increase of 150 basis points from the second quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.1%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items, primarily the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 21% to $113.1 million and earnings increased to $1.32 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended September with $225.5 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $48.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. Free cash flow for the first six months declined slightly as anticipated to $162 million due to the planned increase in capital spending. However, we have not invested as much capital as we thought in the first half of the fiscal year, simply due to the timing of projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending by $20 million to $260 million, an increasing our free cash flow expectations to $320 million. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt?
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael, and good morning everyone. As you’ve already heard from Mike, our second quarter continued the trend of outperformance that began in our last fiscal year with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all four segments. The additional volume, higher margin attainment and a lower effective tax rate combined to drive earnings above our expectations for the quarter. Based on our performance in the first half and our expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again updating our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5% for fiscal 2020 up 150 basis points from our prior range of 6% to 7%. The increase is due to outperformance of the underlying business as well as the impact of several small tuck-in acquisitions that we have completed, primarily in healthcare products. While none of the transactions are material on a standalone basis, when combined we expect they will add about $30 million or 100 basis points to our constant currency organic revenue growth for the full fiscal year. For your modeling purposes, second quarter revenue benefited by about $5 million from these tuck-in acquisitions with the balance to be spread across the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has challenging comparisons, which gives us some caution on the growth rate for the second half of the fiscal year. Healthcare Products and AST are the two segments principally driving this increased organic revenue growth. Healthcare Products are seeing improved demand across the segment with steady growth and consumables, improved performance from service and ongoing strength in capital equipment. AST is delivering strong growth, as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues and the capacity expansions that have come online in the past year or so have allowed us to meet that demand. As you may have read, several ethylene oxide facilities operated by others in the industry have been closed temporarily or permanently due to concerns around the emissions of ethylene oxide gas. The safe and efficient use of ethylene oxide sterilization is required to meet the global need for critical life-saving and life-changing medical devices for patients. For context, approximately 50% of single use medical devices around the globe that require sterilization are sterilized using ethylene oxide. These devices include items as simple as adhesive bandages and as complex as pacemakers and surgical kits. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we have picked up a modest amount of volume from customers, who have been impacted by the closures. However, our U.S. ethylene oxide plants are running full, which will limit our ability to take on significant additional capacity in the second half. Given the strength we’ve seen so far this year across our business segments and the pipeline of business we see for the back half, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.50 to $5.65 up $0.12 from last quarter’s outlook. The acquisitions discussed earlier are expected to add approximately $0.05 to our outlook in the second half, with the remainder coming from outperformance of the underlying business. The upper end of our earnings outlook range assumes no impact from the medical device excise tax in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is the calendar first quarter. Although, we believe the device tax will be delayed or repealed around the first of the calendar year, the lower end of our range should absorb this possible uncertainty, if it is not. We’ve had a strong first half of the year and continue to expect another year of record performance in fiscal 2020. We believe the short-term and the long-term future for Steris is bright. We appreciate your ongoing support and appreciate the work of the 12,000 people of Steris, who are making that happen. We’re happy to take any questions you may have for the balance of the meeting. Julie, please open the call for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Walt for your comments. Keith, would you please give the instructions and we’ll get started on Q&A.
Operator: Yes, certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities.
Dave Turkaly: Good morning. Walt, thanks for the color on the EO side. I was curious if you might refresh our memory, in terms of how many of those plants you guys have. And then when you look at the issues, because I’m sure you’re closer to it than certainly who we are. Is it fear out there that’s going to driving the sentiment? Or was there an actual problem that you think you can address? Just I guess, any color on how you stay clear of any of the things that have happened?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. Good morning, Dave. First answer to your question, I guess – to answer your first question, how many facilities we have? We have about – we have nine facilities in the U.S., that sterilize using ethylene oxide and about double that worldwide, which makes sense, because this is used globally. And for all intents and purposes, it’s the only gas use for this purpose around the world. Second answer to your question is, I do think, this is more around fear than around science. And there are conversations going on that are scientifically don’t make a lot of sense. And that’s just one of the things that has happened in this process. But our view is – we are absolutely adamant about running safe facilities. Safety may be the strongest virtue inside of Steris. And when we talk about safety, we think that about the people that work with us and for us. And we also think about the community that we live in. So we are absolutely committed to safety. We have – we know that we are at the – I’ll call it the better end or strong end of the industry, in terms of the way we deploy everything about our facilities, not just how we handle gas. And also – because we do it so much, we can look across plants and look for best ideas across those facilities. So we do think we are at the positive end of the spectrum. As we understand it, roughly 100 plants around the country to do this kind of work. And so, I’m sure there’s a full spectrum of activity. So, but I do think most of the conversation has not been handled scientifically. And I do think, I applaud both the FDA and EPA for working hard to manage this effort and to handle things scientifically in the process. And I think that’s the way it will end up.
Dave Turkaly: Great, thank you for that. And I apologize, I’ve asked you this a number of times, but I’m still trying to get my finger on the pulse of what is happening in terms of surgical procedures. So I mean, another 10% constant currency growth, I know you had maybe a little help from some small deals. But we talked a little bit about baby boomers and the number of procedures, maybe there’s something from, I don’t know, fear about Medicare for all, but any anecdotal commentary from your hospital customers, like, what’s driving the strength and how sustainable do you think it is?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. I mean, I think, we’ve talked about this, and this was a broad question. And there are variances over time, as you pointed out, when people have more ability to pay for things, they tend to do a little more and then they have less ability to pay for things. They do a little less. But since this is healthcare, much of it or most of it is not necessarily something one can decide to or not to do. There are some cosmetic procedures, obviously, where that’s not the case, but those tend not to be driven by healthcare reimbursement. Those tend to be driven more by personal payments. So in broad, it’s just very clear that the number of procedures is rising. And in my view, it will continue to rise. We are – right now, we’re the middle of the baby boom generation is in their mid-60s. And so we still have, I’ll call it the back half of the baby boom generation to get to the mid-60s and really it’s the 60s and 70s, where we spend most of our money, so in terms of healthcare. So procedures are clearly rising. And as we’ve discussed, there’s more and more going out to outpatient type facilities, both in hospital systems and outside of hospital systems. But at the same time, the hospitals are still busy and more and more complex procedures are being done. So for every arthroscopic knee that goes to outpatient, there’s another transplant of hearts or lungs or something that goes, stays in inpatient. So even though the number may not be rising the complexity continues to rise in the hospital settings, and then in many respects, in the outpatient settings. Their complexity is rising as well. And when you put all that together, that drives growth in the industry. I think, you guys have seen the other medical device companies reporting and their reporting strength as well. And that’s a function of procedures.
Dave Turkaly: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.
Larry Keusch: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Walt Rosebrough: Good morning, Larry.
Larry Keusch: I want to come back to the EO comments and I agree with your thoughts there. But, look, there certainly are communities that are voicing concern about having EO facilities in their backyard. So – and I also recognize at the same time, there was just…
Walt Rosebrough: Hey, Larry, you are very soft and breaking up. So we did not catch the last piece of your comment.
Larry Keusch: Yes, sorry about that.
Walt Rosebrough: That’s better.
Larry Keusch: Yes. So really the question here is, look, I recognize there are lack of viable alternatives for EO, but communities are voice and concern about it. So what do you think comes out of the Adcom this week? Where do you think the suggestions from the FDA are going to be to handle at the situation?
Walt Rosebrough: Well, I think, Larry, again, the agency is doing a good job of gathering information. I believe those who attend the meeting and for those who don’t know this, I mean, the FDA has called in order to discuss potential alternatives to ethylene oxide and to discuss other sterilization methods, my personal view, we are presenting there, if you would like to see our – some of our thoughts, if you will, in that space. The FDA asked for presenters, they chose the ones that they thought would be the better ones to discuss or not every presenter who requested to speak is speaking. So in any event, I think you will see what we largely know, that is there a lot of ways to sterilize things. And we know that because we use virtually all of them someplace, somewhere it is just certain methods of sterilization are better for certain activities. And at this moment in time, and I think for the – certainly the intermediate to long-term future ethylene oxide is going to be a significant portion of that, because it’s particularly effective for single use devices that cannot withstand heat or radiation. And on the other hand can accept that gas and that gas is very gentle on the devices. And frankly, a lot of that is because it’s been the method of choice by both the agency and medical device makers for decades now. And so everyone’s designed around that, designed for that. So for a long time, in my opinion, that will be a significant method. And even though, my earlier comments were, I believe exactly what I said, that we have a lot of non-science being discussed. That doesn’t mean, in our view that we can’t continuously improve. We have been improving our processes and the way we manage that technology for decades now and we will continue to improve that. And one of the biggest areas in our view is that, and it’s typical of a lean approach to things. And the key is not to remediate. The key is to useless. And so a year or so ago, up two years ago, almost now, we had developed a procedure and process to do what we call sustainable ethylene oxide. And we have seen many of our customers accept that and they can use maybe up to 50% less gas. And if you use 50% less gas, you have even lower than 50% less, going out end of the year, because some of the gas is used, obviously. And so in any event, we think that that’s a great approach. That’s one of the things we will be discussing in the next couple of days at the agency and we are seeing more and more customers for semi obvious reasons, thinking that that’s a good idea. So I think we’ll see much greater use of lower levels of gas to get the same level of sterilization. It’s still sterile. We kill all the bugs. That’s what sterile means, but we can do so with less gas.
Larry Keusch: Okay. That’s helpful. And then two other questions for you. Just help us think a little bit more about the implied deceleration in the organic constant currency revenue base for the second half of the year. I think, if you use the midpoints of the range and take that 100 basis points of inorganic contribution, the back half is going to imply something like, 4.5%-ish. So maybe just again, flush that out a little bit. And I guess the other question is, how do we think about the Healthcare Products backlog, which I believe declined about 2% in this quarter. Thank you.
Walt Rosebrough: Sure, Larry. As we mentioned in the – in our prepared remarks, the fourth quarter last year was pretty phenomenal and it was pretty phenomenal on top of a previous year of pretty phenomenal. And we just don’t forecast beating beats all the time. And so our pause is related to the strength of the fourth quarter last year, not a lack of strength in our current business. And as I mentioned before, as our plants get more full, which they are getting pretty full right now, it is more difficult, if you have built something for one customer. And they – at the last minute decide they’re not going to take something and if you have a lot of capacity, it’s easy to flip that to another customer or to move things around. It is more difficult to do that, when we’re at the stronger end if you will of use of our capacity. Our guys have done a great job, adding capacity without building buildings the last several years. And so we do have the ability to do that. We do have the ability to meet the forecast we have in place, but we have less flexibility at the last minute to move something. So it could slip out of the quarter. It only takes a couple of significant projects to move out of the quarter, in order for us to have a little bit lower growth rate. I think your numbers might be a little low, in terms of the numbers – in terms of what the “implied” deceleration means. But – and truthfully, we don’t worry that much about quarters, the implied acceleration in the year is pretty positive. In terms of backlog, backlog is a function of orders coming in and shipments going out. And as you have seen, our shipments in healthcare have been extraordinary in the last two quarters. And as a result – and our orders have been quite strong and our pipeline continues quite strong. And so we have this temporal thing, where we shipped a little bit more than the orders that came in, but you’re talking minute levels, I think couple of million dollars or something like that year-over-year.
Mike Tokich: Yes, Larry, it’s Mike. If you look, we did grow backlog sequentially by about $12 million. And to Walt’s point, our first half capital equipment shipments in healthcare were up almost 9% year-over-year, which is we haven’t seen that in the past. So that definitely explains why backlog is down just slightly year-over-year.
Larry Keusch: Okay.
Mike Tokich: And the like, the backlog is at near record levels. So total backlog is still up about 2%.
Larry Keusch: Great. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate the thoughts.
Mike Tokich: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review.
Jason Rodgers: Yes. I wonder if you could just make some comments on any new developments as far as the outsourcing trend in the U.S. that’s picking up any steam at all.
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. The – we continue to have customers talking to us about outsourcing. As I mentioned before, I think the models will be somewhat different in the United States and they have been in the UK. And I think there will be various models that come into play. But we’re still on track for the revenue growth that we’ve – revenues that we’ve expected, revenue growth that we’ve expected. And we don’t have any reason to change that view. So we still think that’s a positive grower for our business and we continue to see the same. In fact, one of the things we talked about is that we are spending money again in the service business. You have to spend in front of growth, that’s not always true in every business. But we have to spend money in front of growth to get people ready for future revenues. And so we clearly have seen that win. I suspect we’ll see that in the back half of the year that we will have – we’ll be spending ahead of future growth in the business.
Jason Rodgers: And speaking of spending for future growth, looking at the HSS segments, the operating income was held back somewhat by the investments there. Is that the expectation over the next few quarters?
Walt Rosebrough: I don’t know about next few quarters, I definitely would say, the next quarter, I’m pretty sure that’s the case. And then the question is how quickly the revenue comes in to support it. But we are continuing to and expect to continue to spend for growth going forward. The question is how quickly the revenue comes along with it. But orders of magnitude, we’re still thinking double-digit kind of profitability. So it’s not like, we’re not anticipating going from where we are now to 8% or something like that. It’s more modest conversation I think.
Jason Rodgers: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens.
Chris Cooley: Good morning and appreciate you taking the questions and congrats on a really strong fiscal second quarter. Just maybe two for me. On the growth side, while that’s little bit uncharacteristic for you to raise full year guidance after the second quarter. I’m looking back here, historically, that’s 3Q event for you. So with a strong fourth quarter comp that you’ve referenced a number of times here now this morning, could you maybe just help us think through all the different puts and takes here in the back half and what really gives you that much confidence in this kind of revised range, when we look at both of revenue and earnings and cash flow? And then I have a quick follow-up as well.
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. Chris. I mean, first of all, we’ve discussed that these tuck-in acquisitions raise revenue a point and we moved to 1.5 points. We needed to move because of those and for another 0.5 point we thought that was well within what we should expect. And we kept the range roughly the same. So at a high level, that’s really the simple description. When we – on the earning side, again, there’s the first component is indeed the piece that we talked about with the business development. So those acquisitions do provide some level of earnings. But then in addition to that, we’ve clearly seen, our plants are running full and when plants run full, they tend to do a little bit better. That’s the expansion. And we continue – we don’t – haven’t talked about it, but we continue to do more and more in-sourcing. And so our plants, in addition to adding volume are continuing to in-source and that’s – that just squares the impact, because you’re growing and you’re in-sourcing. So it makes it even better. So that’s the – those are the positive things. Now, we did leave the range in earnings roughly the same, which for the year, we only have half a year to go, but we still haven’t seen device tax sort out. We still haven’t seen Brexit sort out. We still have – trade is an every other day conversation. So we left the range as it is, because we do think there’s a bit more uncertainty of what may occur. But given what we have already put in the bank and what we anticipate in the orders we have in hand and the orders we see coming, we just thought it was advisable to move up.
Chris Cooley: Understood, I appreciate the additional color. I apologize hopping between a couple of calls here this morning. My final one is just on the cash flow guidance. And it’s hard to nitpick at what’s essentially 10% of sales at the mid point of guidance, really healthy cash flow target for the year. But we’re not really getting that much leverage there. It looks like it’s the CapEx delta, that’s really now going into cash flow. So I guess just to bring it together, I understand you have to spend to continue to grow and there’s been a lot of investment in AST. But is this kind of, as good as we can get, when we think about cash flow going forward. Or is there opportunity for greater leverage from a cash flow perspective as we just kind of think dramatically over the next three years, as you start to leverage some of the different investments you’ve made and the capacity comes online and gets utilized at AST. Thank you so much.
Mike Tokich: Hey, Chris, this is Mike. So good question, and all we did – you’re right in the guidance is we have taking down CapEx and we did increase cash flow by the exact same $20 million. But what you’re not seeing is we do not adjust free cash flow. So there is another roughly $15 million of impact to free cash flow for the acquisition, the integrations, our restructuring costs are still coming and impacting us. So if you were to back those out, you would add another $15 million, which I think would help solve the issue that you’re looking for in still doing a nice job of generating solid free cash flow.
Chris Cooley: Super. Congrats on a super quarter. Thanks.
Mike Tokich: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: Great. Thanks for taking questions. Well, Mike, Julie and congratulations on really continued strong momentum in the business.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, sir.
Matthew Mishan: Just a quick question on the sites that you’re – in AST, on the sites that you’re opening expanding, could you give us a sense of the breakdown between EO, Gamma, e-beam, and whether or not that’s U.S. capacity or international capacity?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. We’re doing so many, Matt. At the top of my head, that level of breakdown is a little tough. I will tell you that we do announce those on our website. And so if you want details, you could easily pick them up off of our website. But at a high level, I can say, the preponderance of the openings, both U.S. and globally are radiation based, not ethylene oxide based. And we are growing our capacity in ethylene oxide and we have grown it in both the U.S. and OUS. And orders of magnitude, roughly in line with our expectation of what EO growth will be, which is more on that 5% to 7% range. But on the other hand, on the radiation side, we have expected a bit faster growth. And so we are growing our radiation business, again, both in the U.S. and OUS more rapidly even than that have and continue to. And all things being equal, we are expanding much more in either e-beam or x-ray than we are in cobalt gamma radiation. And we see those as being complimentary. And so, generally speaking, we’re expanding in either x-ray or e-beam in or both in or around cobalt facilities we already have, as well as locating some in new sites. And the reason for that is customers, may not be comfortable or said differently, we’d be more comfortable moving to x-ray or e-beam, if they have a cobalt backup is the one thing. That’s also where the customers are that need radiation. So it’s a combination of those two events. So generally speaking, we expect to see cobalt around a long, long, long time. But more of the growth of the business we expect to happen in either e-beam or x-ray, so those forms of radiation.
Mike Tokich: Hey, Matt, just for some context, if you look at our EO business, our EO is about 25% of total AST revenue. So that gives you some context of the impact of EO with our facilities and the total revenue for the year.
Matthew Mishan: I mean, maybe this is a bad question. I tend to ask a lot of those, but how interchangeable or some of the products between EO and gamma. Is there a certain percentage that that could switch and the same question EO versus the e-beam and x-ray?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, you can answer that kind of gas versus radiation in short and EO – specifically EO. There is a small percentage of product that can be done with either one. And they are, for lack of better term, semi interchangeable. We happen to have surprise of our own that we sterilize that we know we can do either way. Having said that, the preponderance of products are one or the other. Because the, it’s not that they both wouldn’t sterilize in most cases, there are some cases, where they actually wouldn’t sterilize, because the radiation or gas can’t get to the product. But generally speaking, they could sterilize, but you ruin the product with the sterilization methodology. And so obviously, we can’t ruin the product, while we’re sterilizing. So at a high level, I’d say, it’s – this is ballpark with maybe 10% or 15% of either one could go either way, but we’re not talking 90% that can go either way. Is at a high level. So there is some substitution possibility, but limited. Having said that, that’s why we have virtually every form of sterilization on the planet, because what is really good to do in hospitals for reprocessing, where we commonly use hydrogen peroxide is almost useless for most industrial sterilization, where we’re doing it in the first time and things that are pre-packaged for a variety of reasons. The same is true for most of the gas versus and will steam, for example, steam is commonly used in hospitals. It’s completely irrelevant industrial, because that’s already packaged. And so you would be ruining the packaging, if nothing else and it probably wouldn’t work anyway. So at a high level, it’s very limited. Now when you come to the inside of radiation, x-ray versus e-beam versus cobalt, there the combination of x-ray and cobalt, there’s much more substitutability if you will. And it varies based again on the device itself, the packaging the device, the way it is put in place. So there is much more substitutability radiation versus radiation, there is very limited really substitutability gas to radiation at a high level.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. That’s actually very helpful and I really do appreciate you giving all this color on this business, on the conference call. And then just moving to margins, especially on Healthcare Products, we’re now moving into that mid-20s level, it appears. And I remember you’ve talking previously about, you get a little bit worried once you get up into that mid-20s level. Have we kind of reached a point where we’re – those are about to kind of level out?
Walt Rosebrough: Matt, your problem is you’ve been covering us too long, we’re going to be looking for a new analyst only been around six or seven years, because I haven’t said that for six or seven years. The short answer is, there is no business that we don’t believe we can improve. And so we’re always working to improvement. In any business, there’s a point at which for any product line or any space, you risk creating a price umbrella and other competitors decide to take that business from you because of price and we monitor that very carefully. We – that’s why, as you know, we reduce costs faster than our profits rise, because we tend to place some of that cost production back into price, if you will, or not raising prices. It’s not that we’re cutting prices, usually, it is that we’re not raising prices. So that’s a part of our mantra. You are correct, you get to certain levels you have to start watching that. But the other side of this, we have to remember is ROS, return on sales is not the only determinant of whether things are price correctly or whether it’s hard or difficult to enter to compete. ROIC is also a very, very important component, in fact, more important component. And so, some of those products that are making very healthy returns on sales, we have to invest an awful lot of capital to get there. And whether that capital is capital, intellectual property types of capital or whether that is, surely capital spending kind of capital or inventory and receivables kind of capital, working capital that we also watch that very carefully. We’re comfortable with where we are. And I’m not ready to declare an end, as I think I said maybe four or five years ago, when we get to 20, we’ll talk about it. Well, we’re talking about it. So we’re not feeling any natural cap in our business.
Matthew Mishan: Right. And excellent. And then the last one I’m done. Of all of the small deals that you’ve done it, is there any that you want to particularly call out as being a long-term growth driver, something that’s a pretty good – it’s something that has pretty nice adjacency to what your strategy looks like?
Walt Rosebrough: No, not at this time. These are tuck-ins, I think each one of them will help there. They’re spread kind of across the various product lines. So it’s not like there’s four of them instead than one product line that’s going to change things. When we – at HSS, when we were buying three or four companies at one time, that was significant, because it was concentrated. These are spread out, even though, most of them in Healthcare Products are spread out across the very different product lines and all products. So in total, does that – does it enhance our Healthcare Products business? Absolutely, yes. Does it enhance our ability to serve our customers and hospitals better? Yes. But these are not, I’ll call it world changing acquisitions.
Matthew Mishan: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.
Larry Keusch: Walt, I suppose at the Adcom, there will certainly be discussion around alternative sterilization methodologies. And again, I certainly recognize that just sort of a purely practical perspective, EO gas is going to remain a key sterilization mode for many, many years. But just on alternates, do you see any out there or do you guys have something that you maybe developing that could be a viable as a large scale commercial alternative to gas to EO gas?
Walt Rosebrough: Larry, first of all, we don’t discuss future product to product development, acquisitions for a reason, so that’s kind of statement number one. We are presenting on one alternative, which will be is and will be used in the space, which is a hydrogen peroxide for this space. But it’s our own view and we see, as you might expect, everyone who has a thought or a novel thought about how one might sterilize something when they think about who they should go to see if it works and/or to see if we can commercialize it, since we are the broadest, deepest, widest sterilizer in the world. It has a habit of coming to us one way or another. And I can say unequivocally that for the short to intermediate term, and I’m talking not days and weeks, I’m talking, years and decades. We do not see an alternative of scale that will change the ethylene oxide picture for industrial sterilization in the world.
Larry Keusch: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments.
Julie Winter: Thank you everyone for joining us again today and for your continued support and we look forward to seeing many of you out on the road in the coming weeks.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-08-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Steris PLC First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Julie Winter, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Keith and good morning everyone. As usual, on today's call we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO. And I do have a few words of caution. Before we open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could also cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including without limitation those risk factors described in STERIS's securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS's SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions is available in today's release including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency, organic revenue growth was 10% driven by volume and 120 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 44.2% and was favorably impacted by productivity, price mix and currency, somewhat offset by higher labor and material costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 19.5% of revenue, an increase of 160 basis points from the first quarter last year, despite an increase in SG&A expenses, mostly relating to higher incentive compensation given the strength of the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated, due to favorable discrete items primarily the benefit related to stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 23% to $105 million and earnings increased to $1.23 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower tax rate. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended June with$ 238.1 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the first quarter capital expenditures totaled $49.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $47.1 million. Free cash flow for the first three months declined as anticipated to $59.6 million due to the increased capital spending. With that I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Michael and good morning everyone. As you've already heard from Mike we started fiscal 2020 stronger than expected with growth meeting or exceeding our expectations in all four segments. The additional volume and the lower effective tax rate drove earnings above our expectations for the quarter, based on our performance in the first quarter and revised expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are now updating our full-year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal 2020, up a 100 basis points from our original 5% to 6% range. The updated revenue forecast suggests that the outperformed -- out performance in the first quarter holds for the year and that we will experience somewhat higher volumes than we originally planned over the remaining course of the year. The two segments of our business that are driving the increased volume growth for the year versus our original plan, our Health care Products and AST. Health care Products is seeing improved demand for both consumables and capital equipment. Our new products have helped grow consumable sales in sterility assurance, instrument cleaning chemistries and V-PRO consumables. On the capital equipment side, we have a strong backlog of capital equipment orders, and a healthy pipeline going forward. When our capital equipment grow significantly, we can run into capacity constraints in our shared manufacturing facilities in any given period. Our revenue forecast recognizes our efforts to run our plants at normalized run rates throughout the year, which creates some risk for potential timing issues and capital equipment shipments at quarter ends and year-ends. The AST segment continues to deliver strong growth, as increased demand from our core medical device customers continues. And we feel the capacity of the expansions we have made in past years. This encourages us about our significant expansion plans for AST that we have previously reported. With the additional volume growth, we are -- for the total company, we are increasingly comfortable with approximately 75 basis point improvement in EBIT margin percentage. We also anticipate that our effective tax rate for FY '20, will be at the low end of our original guidance of 19% to 20%. With all these factors considered, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.53, up $0.10 from our original outlook. While our first quarter exceeded consensus by $0.12, it did not meet our internal plan by that much. As a result, we continue to expect earnings in our revised forecast to be weighed about 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half. The rest of our outlook is unchanged. As we continue to expect about $280 million in capital spending to fuel future organic growth in our businesses, and $300 million in free cash flow for the year. Our capital spending has started the year a bit light as Mike has said, but we expect it to ramp up over the next three quarters as our projects move forward. On a completely different note, as you likely saw in our proxy, we had several board members retire as of our annual meeting. Loyal Wilson had the foresight to be the initial primary investor in Steris' over 30 years ago. He has served on our Board ever since, and he has made innumerable contributions over his tenure. Dr Michael Wood has been a Board member for 15 years and has brought a unique perspective in the surgeon former CEO of the Mayo Clinic. And sir, Duncan Nichol former Head of the NHS, in the UK joined our Board several years ago as the result of our combination with Synergy Health, where he was Chairman and a longstanding Board member. All three of these individuals have made significant contributions to our company over many years. We thank them for their service and wish him the very best. In closing, we started this year strong and continue to expect another year of record performance in FY '20. We believe the short term and the long-term future for STERIS is bright and we appreciate your ongoing support. We are now pleased to take any questions you may have. Julie, can you start Q&A, please.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike for your comments. Keith, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started on Q&A.
Operator: Yes, certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: Great and thank you for taking the questions and an outstanding quarter.
Mike Tokich: Thanks, Matt.
Matthew Mishan: Walt, Mike, can you guys start off with AST and if you can help explain the increased demand you're seeing and whether or not it's near term transitory due to a competitor issue or is this just large scale market share gains you're seeing over a multi-year period of time?
Mike Tokich: You know Matt, we have been very strong in AST now for several quarters, stronger than our expectation frankly. There has been some, but I think we reported last time some modest increase probably due to Brexit in Europe. There has been some modest increase due to the Chicago closing that you refer to. And then there has been just good underlying generic increases. We've talked about this before, we continue to put capacity in places where our medical device customers are expanding. And we haven't seen our the OEMs who are making these devices generally speaking, haven't been building capacity for that growth. So by definition there outsourcing or and we have had the good fortune of picking up, probably more than our fair share of that growth, due to having our plants in the right places. And that's why we have continued expanding kind of on the come if you will, for the next 10 years and we will continue to do that. So we're comfortable that we're growing a bit faster than the market, but I don't think it's radically faster and it's not due to any particular big swing of a customer A to customer B or someone from a customer moving to us. We call this churn. Our net churn has been roughly constant for quite a while. We have picked up positively for quite a while, but it's not out of range. So this is a [indiscernible] for lack of better terms true growth in picking up the growth of the device customers. And we are obviously getting a little bit better than our fair share.
Matthew Mishan: Okay, outstanding. And then could you also give us a sense of the momentum you're seeing right now in your [indiscernible] ORC business.
Walt Rosebrough: Matt, this conversation is not dissimilar from what we've been saying and that is, that that business is continuing to grow. It's growing nicely faster than our average growth and it will grow in a little bit lumpy terms, probably in the short run. But I can tell you the pipeline of people who are interested in doing things continues to grow and we feel very good about the growth prospects going forward.
Matthew Mishan: Alright, and then lastly, international versus US. There has been other companies that have indicated there has been some international cap equipment delays. Any -- trends you're seeing like differently there versus here.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, we've seen Europe is kind of flat. So if you look at that relative to the US, no question that it has not grown as the US. US has been hot now for a while and continues hot in our view. Latin America for us is kind of picked up. Since the relative volume there is small it's hard to tell. If we just picked up some orders or if the market is a little stronger. But we feel much better about Latin America and Asia Pacific has also done nicely. So we're comfortable there. So that the kind of the weak spot, if you will, for growth has been in Europe the last little bit. And I think that's consistent with what other people have reported.
Matthew Mishan: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens.
Chris Cooley: Good morning. I appreciate you taking the questions. Walt. I'm trying to think, when the last time it's been that I've seen you actually raised guidance on the first fiscal quarter. And it's been some time. I guess –
Walt Rosebrough: I suspect, Chris you haven't found one.
Chris Cooley: That's right. But my -- we started to lose me now at this age. It is a. So I guess 2 quick questions from me one, when we look at the quarter, obviously it was very, very strong. But if we did want to knit anything, it's the rate of growth in the backlog did decelerate both within healthcare capital and as expected within the Life Science space . Could you just maybe remind us what you're seeing there? Well, I think the Life Science segment makes a lot of sense and is expected the deceleration to basically 6% growth in the backlog year-over-year. A little bit lower than maybe I would have anticipated. So just maybe talk to us a little bit, what you're seeing in the capital environment -- healthcare capital environment in the short run, and I'll have a quick follow-up.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, Chris. We're not seeing any deceleration of, I'll call it pipeline or order pipeline coming in. In fact, if anything, it would be the opposite. So backlog is a relatively small piece of orders and it's orders might have shipments. So we shipped a bit more in this quarter than you might have expected. And the backlog fell a little bit, but in terms of order rates pipeline, we're not seeing any decline. So this is a temporal change, which often happens and capital in any given any given quarter. As you know, we've grown backlog a lot in the last 12 months. And so if it drops off a little bit then concern. There is some point in which in fact we have 2 types of orders some that ship in 12 to 18 months and some the ship in and use of more like 6 to 9 in and 12 to 24 in Life Science. But there are some points, if you have a lot of your backlog, it is asap type backlog having too much actually is as a problem. So we have a bunch of [indiscernible] orders from customers. We try to get them out as quickly as we can. So this does not concern us at all. And it does not reflect any concern in our view of orders coming in or pipeline forwarders.
Mike Tokich: And Chris, this is Mike. The other number that that what you are correct in the 6% but if you look at sequentially, we are up $33 million or 21%. So again, it has a lot to do with timing and fluctuations and we were up 7% growth in capital equipment for the quarter, which is a little bit higher than we typically see anyhow. So it's all about the timing again to Walt's point, I don't think there is any concern on our end.
Walt Rosebrough: But I don't disagree -- we see shrinking backlog then that would give you pause. It's just the backlog such a small piece of your total shipments that the order rates coming in, that we're more interested in and that still looks strong.
Chris Cooley: Appreciate the additional [indiscernible]. It's what I thought. Just lastly then for me when you look at AST but if you've got a new high watermark for operating margin in the quarter. Looking back here historically, which is really impressive. So talk to us maybe about where you are in terms of existing capacity utilization, maybe how the mix has shifted across sterilization techniques. Basically just trying to get a little bit better feel for, is this. Can we improve upon this new high watermark as we go to the fiscal year, or is this kind of the new normal as we model that business? Thanks so much.
Walt Rosebrough: Sure, Chris. Great question. And in terms of that our plants when we grow faster than we expect. And as we have said we're building plants. So our plants are getting pretty full and it's more a function of our plants being very nicely utilized right now on a percentage run basis than kind of any other factor. So we will see temporal fluctuations in those numbers and right now we're running pretty hot. I wouldn't bet my life on 40% the rest of time, but I mean obviously we've been in the high '30s and low '40s for a while. I think those numbers are reasonable numbers to be thinking about.
Chris Cooley: Congratulations on the quarter.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review.
Jason Rodgers: Yes, just looking at your improved outlook on the Healthcare Products side. How much would you say of that is due to the new product introductions? Is there anything on the consumable or the equipment side that you would consider a needle mover there?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, you know on that I've forgotten exactly the number, but we have something in the order of 20 -- 30 new products that we introduced last year, which really what's filling the pipeline for this year. And we have 23 new products that we're going to introduce this year and I might even be a little on the Life side on the Healthcare Products side. So it's not any one silver bullet. It's just a lot of new products that are picking up steam. I mentioned the ones where we've seen some kind of significant growth. I mentioned that in the text the Australian assurance products are growing quite nicely for us right now. We have a number of new products in that space. V-PRO is driven not by new consumable but by new products, new capital products as we place those new capital products and we have just a completely new line of V-PRO now and those new capital products dose do drive the consumables or allow the consumables to grow so. And then our ICC business again We have multiple new products in [indiscernible], cleaning chemistries and those are just continuing to take hold. We think we have the best line in ICC now by a margin, significant margin. So they continue to grow. So it's not any one product and there is a series of also sterilizers and washers particularly for Europe. We're not seeing any one product be a dominant force here. It's just multiple products and the combination of them; washers, sterilizers and in the things that go with them ORI and tables lights and the things that go with them, it's not so much a single product, it's the family of products working together that I think is the driver.
Jason Rodgers: All right. And any change in expectations for the impact on the tariffs. I mean, I think it's that material, but I just wanted to check on that.
Walt Rosebrough: Good check is our best estimate at this time of the newest round of China tariffs is something on the order of $1 million a year. So although we don't like seeing $1 million of disappear. It's well within the guidance range that we've laid out.
Jason Rodgers: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti.
Mitra Ramgopal: Yes, hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions. First on the restructuring plan announced back in December. I was just wondering if you're still holding to about the 12 million of cost savings would half this year and a half next year in terms of --
Mike Tokich: Yes, Mitra. We are on target that $6 million will be mostly in the back half of the year, which is reflected in our outlook for the savings and we are definitely tracking on target. Good question.
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay, thanks. And Mike, it looks like you might have done a tuck-in acquisition this quarter. I'm just wondering if you had any additional color on that.
Mike Tokich: Yes, we did a small acquisition in middle of the quarter, it was a systems acquisition in our health care space, specifically in our IPT infection prevention technology space, that will generate somewhere in the neighborhood of around $10 million of revenue this year.
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay, thanks. That was great. And then just coming back on the Life Sciences business, I know that is obviously been a little lumpy in the past, but if you look at it last couple of years it's actually been holding up pretty well. I was just wondering if you think going forward, we should continue to kind of see these numbers in terms of where the backlog is.
Mike Tokich: Yes. As we've said we had this huge run up of business probably three years ago now, it's hard to remember, but where we were growing 20%, 25% a year for 18 months or 24 months or so. And then we've sort of leveled off at that level, we're very comfortable at that level or backlogs remain roughly in the $60 million range. And when we're in that range of backlog, we feel we can do these numbers on the capital equipment side in Life Science. We're pretty comfortable -- we're seeing growth but it's modest growth more in line with single digit, low-single digit kind of growth, not atypical of capital equipment. But it is lumpy. This last quarter. I, it's 35%. -- 40%, up so and the previous quarter was off a little bit. So that's kind of the way that business works, relatively small amounts of business that comes in large sizes, those machines can be a $1.5 million a piece. So you get a couple of those together and you have a really good quarter for a couple of slip into the next quarter. You have a weak quarter. But, we're pretty comfortable sustaining that level at this point in time and our visibility, how the future looks that way as well. So we're pretty comfortable there. The consumable side is continuing to grow very nicely and we anticipate that continuing.
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay, thanks. It's very helpful and congrats again on a great quarter.
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.
Larry Keusch: Good morning, everyone. So two questions, Walt, you know look I appreciate the strong start to the year and the increase in the organic constant currency guidance to that 6% to 7% range, but given that you just came off a 10% organic quarter. How do we reconcile the implied deceleration as you move through the year.
Walt Rosebrough: Larry. We just had a high quarter. And I don't think we would characterize our entire business growing 10% a year going forward. So obviously, I mean the math suggests a slowdown. I haven't done the actual numbers, myself, I'm guessing in the 5% to 6% range, something like that to get to that, which is well within our normal range. So we had a high quarter we're having a strong year. We anticipate continuing to have a strong year. But we're not ready to say we're 10% growth at infinity. So I think that's pretty much a reconciliation.
Larry Keusch: Okay, perfect. And then, just given that the dollar is generally continue to strengthen, can you remind us again just how we should be thinking about some of the impact from the currencies, whether it'd be the Mexican peso or the pound?
Mike Tokich: Yes, Larry, this is Mike. So what in general what we tend to like is a strong euro and a strong pound. And then on the opposite side, we tend to like a weak peso and weak Canadian dollar and the reasons for that is on the Canadian side and the Mexican side we have manufacturing. So, the lower the cost the better for us. And then on the euro and the pound, we have sales channel. So we get more benefit by having those currencies, the pound and the euro at a much higher exchange rate than the dollar.
Walt Rosebrough: And the euro on the pound are largely service businesses for us, it's heavily, more heavily with the service as opposed to product. So the revenue and cost travel together, but the margin component shrinks, if it's -- if those currency shrink, but I would say to Larry all people who export which we do export a fair amount, and we export a fair amount from the United States, not just from Canada and Mexico and France and Finland, where we have products and the UK. So we export from all those places to a lot of other countries. And so pressure on those -- as those currencies rise it puts pressure on us, but we're getting to where we're fairly neutral to those kind of questions because it's rare for the 5 or 6 currencies that reeled off where we have manufacturing plants to all be moving in the same direction against everybody else. So we are more naturally hedged, both on a profit basis and on an overall can we sell things with that against tougher currencies we're more heads than we've ever been.
Larry Keusch: Okay, perfect. And just lastly on that, can you just remind me, I just don't have it off the top of my head, were there any changes made to the FX outlook for the year on this quarter?
Mike Tokich: We did increase the negative impact for revenue to $10 million and we still believe EBIT is neutral. So no impact on the bottom line, but increase on the negative side, on the top line.
Larry Keusch: Okay, perfect. Thanks, Mike. Thanks Walt.
Mike Tokich: You're welcome, Larry.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from there [indiscernible] with our JMP Securities.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you and congrats. Walt just want sort of high level question here. We kind of talked around this a bit in the past, noting that in every time there's a surgical procedure in a hospital, there's a revenue opportunity for STERIS I'd love to get your thoughts on hospital volumes, procedure volumes and what you think is sort of happening. If we look at this quarter, really across segments in the medical device world there a lot of strength and I don't know the pointing to any specifics. I'm curious if you're seeing anything that's maybe, driving an increase in surgical procedures or operations.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, I know you're exactly right. We clearly are seeing strength in medical devices, in terms of volumes. Every hospital I've talked to recently tells me there are always busy, so we're seeing those facilities busy. Now you have to separate you asked about hospitals, you have to separate inpatient care from inpatient surgeries from outpatient surgeries and for our purposes, we don't really care if the surgery is inpatient or outpatient and by the way I use surgery in the broader sense, it can be any number of procedures like in this capex procedures where our US industry business works really well if they're doing those procedures. So it's procedures in hospitals and-or ambulatory surgery centers and GI centers or other procedural centers in our view it has clearly been strong. We've said before for the long term. If you look at the high level and for the long term, we have the baby boom in North America. Running through it in much of Western Europe and that baby boom wants to have new hips and new shoulders, and a sculpt knee and multiple other issues and as fast as ambulatory surgery is growing, which it is and ambulatory surgery in the US, at least the fastest growing area for our business as fast as it's growing, it's also getting more complexities. So, and they need to do have real sterilization capabilities in ambulatory surgery centers and other GI centers and by the same token, there are more and more complex surgery being done in the acute settings. And so even though it looks like oh gee! We only did 5 surgeries, but if 2 of them were double transplants that's very different than doing 5 sculpt knees. So I think both the complexity of surgeries in acute care continues to rise. In ambulatory surgery we're seeing faster growth in the less intensive procedures Are moving more and more in the ambulatory setting where patients want them to be. And we have this push of the baby boom coming through, who is going to require more and more in all across the Western world or the industrialized world. And then the non-industrialized world as their GDP per capita rises more and more people can afford this kind of health care. So we think the long-term outlook for the rate of procedures is quite good and which is why we've invested in that space.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for all the detail.
Operator: Thank you. And next is a follow-up from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: Great. I mean you just have a follow-up to David's question. I guess is how has your value proposition to the hospital system, kind of, especially with the rise of in share of the ASCs changed over like the last couple of years.
Walt Rosebrough: Well, you know, Matt, I would say, I don't think it's radically change in a couple of years. But what we have done as you have seen as we bring more and more products and services around this procedural space. And so we are stronger today do the family of products and services, bringing in IMS, so we can help them with their surgical instruments. Bringing in the ORC concept, bring in the mobile units that were if they are out of capacity we can help them out. In addition to all the new products and services that we brought into the Healthcare Products. We just are a much stronger entity and more able to help them in many different ways in the procedural areas. And so, but I wouldn't call it a radical change in the last 2 years. But if you look at the last dozen years. We're a very different entity when we're facing the hospital procedures that we were 10 years ago, let's say.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. And then, last quarter you talked a little bit about some kind of stocking ahead of Brexit. And you talked about as well as a shift in manufacturing in Life Sciences positively impacting sales of by about $5 to $10 million. And then you also talked about a headwind from your larger restructuring that you are absorbing on top of that. Can you just talk a little bit maybe about the timing of those? And when do you expect to see, to see that those shifts through 2020?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, Matt, great question and I'll kind of try to walk through the 2 or 3 items that you mentioned, actually. First of all [indiscernible] these Brexit and well it vis-a-vis Brexit we said at the time we were pretty sure there was about 5 million pull forward and we had no idea how much else it might be. And so we were guessing in the 5 to 10 million range. We still don't really know because we don't have visibility to all that space. But the fact that the quarter stayed very strong suggest that it wasn't 10, that it was probably closer to the 5 number that we were well aware of, plus or minus a million or two. So we're feeling a bit more comfortable that it was the known numbers, plus a little as opposed to known numbers times 2 or 3 or 4. So that's point one, point two given the fact Brexit is not adjudicated. We do think whatever that number is some point in the future and I suspect it would be after and maybe well after the dust settles on how the UK is going to Brexit or not. I but I wouldn't see I think it just speaking from ourselves the buildup. We've made. We're not planning to pull it down and then build it back up again. We're just letting it sit there until they sort out Brexit. So I think that's the most logical thing. So, you tell me when and how they're going to exit. And I'll give you the answer, but I think we're more comfortable in the few million dollar range. In terms of our plant closure. We saw exactly what we expected. There was order pull forward and those orders fell off in the quarter. So that we're over that, that's done. That's part of the reason we feel comfortable, even more comfortable with our forecast because we absorb that without a loss, but it's still was at our plan. So we absorb that one. And in terms of the, with the product closures that will still be out there over probably the next 12 to 15 months, but it's relatively small numbers will be spread over a larger number of months. So I don't think you'll notice. I think I hit all the topics there Matt.
Matthew Mishan: Yes. I think you got them all.
Operator: Thank you. And as there are no more questions, I would like to return the floor to Julie Winter for any closing comments.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Keith. And thank you everyone for joining us this morning and for your continued support to Steris. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-05-14 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the STERIS Plc Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Winter, Senior Director and Investor Relations. Ms. Winter, the floor is yours, ma'am.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and good morning everybody. As usual, in today's call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO. And I do have a few words of caution before I open for comments. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today.

Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency, supplemental financial information used by management, and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie and good morning everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 9% driven by volume and 70 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points to 43.8%, and was impacted favorably by productivity, mix, price, and currency somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.1% of revenue, an increase of 170 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate of the quarter was 19.2%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items along with stock -- the benefit of stock compensation expenses. Net income in the quarter grew 24% to $131.1 million and earnings increased to $1.53 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended March with $220.6 million of cash and $1.2 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $76.5 million, bringing our total spend for the full fiscal year to $189.7 million. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 increased to $355.4 million, mainly due to improvements in cash from operations. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt, for his remarks.
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate the time you all take to discuss our recent performance and our outlook for the new fiscal year. Our message today is simple. We had a strong FY 2019 on both the top and bottom-line and we have a solid momentum heading into fiscal 2020. Underlying demand from our customers and success with new products contributed to 8% constant currency organic revenue growth for the full year, meaningfully above our expectations. Part of that demand was related to the one-time benefit of customers building inventory. As you probably know, many companies have supply chain concerns regarding Brexit. This resulted in some of our customers desiring safety stock ahead of the March 29 Brexit date. Our AST and Healthcare Specialty Services led the way this year in growth rates for fiscal 2019, each increasing revenue 9% on a constant currency organic basis. First, our AST segment, it continues to benefit from our core Medical Device customer growth. Over the past three years, we have invested more than $100 million to expand our global network, which has allowed us to grow with our customers. We are making an even larger commitment this fiscal year as a result of expanding global demand. Our plan is to invest over $110 million to grow AST capacity at a number of facilities around the globe, primarily, in radiation technologies. We remain committed to supporting our Medical Device customers worldwide with the technology-neutral sustainable set of sterilization offerings. We believe these investments will reap rewards for years and anticipate continued investment in capacity in the coming years. We generally expect these facilities to generate ROIC above our capital cost in a three to five-year timeframe. As you know, AST operating profits improved again this fiscal year, ending the full year at 40% EBIT margins. Moving onto the Healthcare Specialty Services business, we experienced a very strong year, particularly in North America. As for our franchise and our rising business in North America both exceeded our expectations as customers see the benefit of sterile solutions. Profit dollars improved 10% and margins improved sequentially quarter by quarter as we leveraged the investments we made earlier. We continue to believe that this segment can achieve mid-teen margins over time. Our Healthcare Products segment also had a good year, increasing 7% on a constant currency organic revenue basis, with solid growth across consumables, service, and capital equipment. Revenue continued to benefit from products loss over the past 12 to 18 months, including our Celerity 20-minute biological indicator, Dipromax 2 and related chemistries, Endo and new washers and sterilizers. We expect another year of robust new product sales in fiscal 2020, including the clean sweep ceiling systems and operating integration systems as well as our recently launched Dipro S2, which offers compact size and shorter cycle site compared with prior generations. Operating profit dollars for Healthcare Products grew double-digits and margins improved 120 basis points to over 24%. And finally, our Life Sciences segment grew annual revenue 5% on a constant currency organic basis versus last year's challenging comparisons. Consumable products led the way with a 7% increase over the prior year, with capital equipment and service growing low single-digits. During the fourth quarter, we moved our products manufacturing to a new facility that will support our growth for many years. As a result of that move, some customers preordered inventory, driving products consumable growth somewhat above normal levels in Q4. This will likely impact our growth rate a bit in the first half of 2020. Life Science continued to improve the bottom line, with 60 basis points improvement in EBIT margin for the year. All told, we ended fiscal 2019 with record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.89. Volume growth, improved margins and a lower than anticipated effective tax rate grew that improvement. I'm looking ahead to fiscal 2020, the underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong. We anticipate constant currency organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, with currency impact approximately neutral to our revenue guidance. Within that revenue outlook, we are absorbing our restructuring plan, which reduces organic revenue by about $20 million in fiscal 2020. Margin expansion will likely be within our typical range, reflecting the benefits of our restructuring, which are somewhat offset by continued investments in the business. We anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. For your modeling, we expect earnings to be split about 45% first half and 55% second half, which is consistent with prior years. We've planned an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% and interest expense to decline $3 million to $4 million in fiscal 2020 due to lower debt levels. As usual, our share count is assumed to be neutral in our guidance, with share repurchases roughly offsetting management equity grants, and to be clear, this outlook assumes no Medical Device excise tax to be in effect in our fiscal fourth quarter. Capital spending is planned to be approximately $280 million in fiscal 2020, a meaningful increase from prior years. As already mentioned, the primary driver is AST expansions. In addition we do plan to continue spending capital to grow our outsourced instrument reprocessing business in the HSS segment. As a result of expectations for strong operating performance, somewhat offset by nearly $100 million of increased capital spending, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $300 million for fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2019 was a great year for STERIS, with all our business segments meeting or exceeding our expectations. That does make for a challenging comparison in FY 2020, but we are confident in our ability to sustain revenue growth in line with our long-term targets and continue our path in increasing earnings in 2020 and beyond. We believe that STERIS is better positioned than ever before and we appreciate your past and continued support of your company. We're happy to take any questions you may have. Julie, if you would open for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt, Mike, for your comments. Mike, if he would give the instructions, and we'll get started on Q&A?
Operator: Yes ma'am. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Dave Turkaly of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
David Turkaly: Thank you and congrats on a solid end to the fiscal year.
Julie Winter: Thanks Dave.
David Turkaly: I just wanted to clarify something. You mentioned $110 million for investment. I think in the prepared remarks, you might have said that, that was entirely for AST, but you also mentioned the Healthcare Specialty investments. So, if that's true, or if you want to, I don't know, break that out between them, I just wonder, how many new centers would that be, and it says global, are they primarily in the U.S., the AST buildout that you're doing? And are they new or are they just expanding existing.
Walt Rosebrough: We probably won't get into the exact details here, but it is multiple sites. It is split fairly well around the globe, so the U.S. makes up roughly half the business, and so the U.S. is roughly half of the expansion, but then the balance is around the globe. The earlier-on expansions are in the U.S., some European and other parts of the world are lagging a little bit. But -- so in terms of dollars this year, it's probably more heavily weighted to the U.S. side, but over dollars, over a longer period of time. And these projects don't end in three months, these are 12, 18, 24 months projects. And so the longer-term tails will be outside the U.S. but at a high level, we've got a lot of expanding and we're continuing to expand more. And it kind of is when you think about it were growing high single-digits or even mid-single-digits, we have to build effectively four or five plants a year, unfortunately not all those are greenfield build. Some of these are greenfield builds, but a number of them are adding a bit to an already existing plant, that's obviously much cheaper. So, it's a combination of all those things that gets us $110 million. And the $110 million was specifically growth investment for AST. We also talked about roughly $100 million in total, because we've had growth divestment in AST last year. The $100 million is in total capital spend and that does include spending for the HSS plant, but it is never plants, if you will. But that level of spending is -- pales of in comparison to the $110 million of AST.
David Turkaly: Got it. Thank you for that. And then you mentioned some of your targets for operating margin, but in your healthcare side was really strong, and I guess, 24% is a nice level for the operating margins to come in. But I'm curious as to -- I'm sorry, I think it was 28% this quarter. Where is that going? If you're looking ahead here, obviously, your biggest segment and a nice uptick in profitability year-over-year, I'm just curious if you have longer term targets for that business alone? Thanks.
Walt Rosebrough: Dave, I guess, we've talked about this a number of times kind of generically and I don't feel different about that business than I do to others. There are puts and takes in that business, sometimes mix has an effect for roughly high margin business going a little faster than the other or vice versa, you have a mix effect. In general, we anticipate being more efficient with our resources over time and sharing some of that with our customers and keeping some of that for ourselves. So, on average, we would hope to grow our profitable a little bit faster than our revenue by doing that, and we don't have a target per se or an endpoint per se, because we add things to it all along and that changes the mix. But in general, our people know that we think we should be more efficient every year and pass the efficiency to our customers.
David Turkaly: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And next we have Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: Good morning Walt, Mike, Julie.
Walt Rosebrough: Good morning Matt.
Matthew Mishan: Hey I guess, first just a housekeeping question. Could you potentially quantify what the Brexit-related inventory build was in the quarter? Where you saw the impact? And the same token -- same thing for the preorder to the Life Sciences consumables?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. The orders -- we expected a question on this, by the way. It's just part of the answer is we don't know what we don't know and we thought that was worthwhile in conversation mode than a discussion mode, but we had visibility and order in $5 million of revenue or I'll call it inventory buildup by customers. It's spread around -- a fair amount in Healthcare Products business, so that -- probably the bulk of it is in Healthcare Products business, but we also saw it in the life science business, because you have pharmaceutical plans on both sides of the pond, and there are both sides of the pond. So, people that are concerned -- and then in AST, people concerned that they may not be able to get the goods either out of England or out of Europe, into England or other places, they built their inventories somewhat. We -- in those places where they told us about it, and told us about it in advance, we had a pretty good visibility. So, again, something on the order of around $5 million with good visibility. What we don't know is what we don't know. Supply chains are sometimes long. The hospital build their inventory and then the their inventory and somebody else bids a little inventory, and AST, if the manufacturers are building inventory in anticipation in their warehouses and they want it sterilized ahead of time, we don't often have visibility to that. So, our best guess is probably something in the $5 million to $10 million range, but it is a guess at this point in time. I don't think it's significantly greater than that.
Matthew Mishan: Does $5 million to $10 million--
Walt Rosebrough: I'm sorry?
Matthew Mishan: Does the $5 million to $10 million including the preorder for ahead of the barrier products?
Walt Rosebrough: That would be -- a great question, yes. That would include that preorder.
Matthew Mishan: Okay, got it. And then the 5% to 6% organic revenue growth for next year, I'll give you credit, it's above where you've started off the last couple of years at 4% to 5%, but it's also below are you exiting around 8%. As you look at the segments, which area do you feel confident in growing above, which may be do you feel confident growing below? And then some of the puts and takes wrapped around the 5% to 6%?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, Matt, I'm not sure that we're going to talk about it that way. It is -- obviously our IMS businesses had two to three solid years in the last two or three years, but that came on the tail of getting beat up because we had a pretty significant miss through three or four years ago. Assuming no significant shift in those customers, we feel pretty good about that business being above the 5% range, certainly. AST has been very hot, hotter than our expectation. We don't know how much of that is inventory build or growth or churn and the things that gets awhile to build those facts and figures, but all things being equal, we probably expect it to be above the average. The Life Science capital -- Life Science capital has been a big grower in the last couple of years. And as we had mentioned in our last call, the Life Science capital side probably is not going to go 20% or 30% a year the rest of the time. It is seen to kind of level off into some modest growth levels, but staying at much higher levels than it was three years ago. So, we're comfortable with the levels. And I don't think we consider that a superfast grower at this point in time. I think at a high level, kind of that gives you the order of magnitude. Mike, do you have any other comment? 
Mike Tokich: Yes, Matt, one of the things that we are going to experience in FY 2020 is about a $20 million negative impact from our restructuring activities. So, those manufacturing facilities that we identified in the third quarter restructuring were going to lose about $20 million of revenue. So, that's going to be absorbed in that 5% to 6%.
Matthew Mishan: Okay, that's fair. And then on the EPS growth you guys typically double-digit growth company, that's what you generally expect. But when you look at the range that's coming in at 8% to 11% for the year, why are you being cautious on the low end there?
Walt Rosebrough: We're on the backside of two really big years of EPS growth. If we do the numbers we have here, and we hit our churn -- if we do the revenues we have in this place, we feel pretty comfortable the 8% to 11%, and this is all inorganic -- very organic, excuse me, growth. And so when we say were double-digit growers and EPS over long periods, we've included the inorganic component. 
Matthew Mishan: And just last question I want to sneak in. On the AST and the dynamics of the growth there in the $110 million expanded capacity, it seems pretty clear here you're outpacing your customer volumes in the quarter, also on that headwind. Does this growth have anything to do with customers reacting to a competitor issue?
Walt Rosebrough: I don't think there's any consequential change there. There's always been churn in the business. Sometimes we lose, sometimes we win, sometimes it's more public than other times. This is one of those times where things are a little bit public. But they have a significant network of their bauxite plants in North America, so the first movement from that plant, obviously, would go to their initial plans. We have picked up a little bit, but I wouldn't call it consequential.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And next we have Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. 
Jason Rodgers: Yes, good morning.
Walt Rosebrough: Good morning Jason.
Jason Rodgers: I wonder if you could talk about the tariff impacts this quarter, what your outlook is there as well as just in general price and raw material costs going forward.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes Jason. For the full year in fiscal 2019, we experienced about $1 million in the combination of labor and tariffs. We are anticipating approximately the same amount in FY 2020 with no material cost in either FY 2019 or FY 2020.
Jason Rodgers: And just a follow-up on the AST question, the EO facilities, is there any risk there as far as elevated admissions issue that your competitor faced potentially impacting you?
Walt Rosebrough: Well, there's always the question of regulatory -- I'll call it, intervention, in any of our businesses. As you know, we're in the healthcare business and we are quite accustomed to dealing with all kinds of regulatory agencies. Our -- a big, big piece of our business across all of our businesses is sterilization, and sterilization, by definition, requires the use of products that are, let's say, they kill bugs -- they kill biological entities, which means we're biological entities, so there's a risk if we don't handle it right, then there's issue. We do handle it right. We've been doing this for 40 years. We do feel that we -- I mean, we know we meet the requirements as they stand today. We are generally speaking ahead of the requirements because many places of the world do not require the same levels of scrutiny that are in the U.S. and Western Europe, and we build our factories or sterilization facilities in a way that it meets the highest levels of standards, both in safety of our people and for admissions. And so the answer is, we think we're in a good spot. We're always looking for ways to improve it, and there's always a risk in all of our business that there's a regulatory impact. Having said that, we don't think there's anybody in the planet better positioned in sterilization and general analysis sterilization with a handle on the consequential thing that the regulators choose to do. So, we're comfortable in our position. I will say, in addition, it's worthwhile to note that roughly half of all devices that have to be sterilized, which is essentially anything that touches your bloodstream, from adhesive bandages to orthopedic implants, I should insert orthopedic implants, because that's a big radiation product, to pacemakers, let's say, so across a wide range of products, roughly 50% of them have to be sterilized with gas of some sort, and ethylene oxide is by far the preferred methodology. And I mean by far, by 99% to 1% kind of numbers. And if we stopped doing ethylene oxide around the world, we would stop healthcare around the world in a few weeks. So, I think all parties -- all the parties working on this are looking for the same thing. We want safety for our workers. We want safety for the patients, and we want safety for the environment. And everybody's working on the same thing, and I'm confident we'll find the proper ways to handle that.
Jason Rodgers: That's helpful. And if I could just squeeze one more in. The outsourcing project in HSS, I think the last estimate was about $10 million in revenue in fiscal 2020. Is that still the case?
Walt Rosebrough: Additional revenue or additional -- yes, we did a little better than that this year. We would hope to do at least that this coming year.
Jason Rodgers: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we have Larry Keusch with Raymond James.
Lawrence Keusch: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe just to start with on the AST expansion. I guess the question, Walt, is -- it sounded like, from your comments, that this is going to be a multiyear process. You see a lot of opportunity out there. Obviously, to grow at the rates you want to grow at, you need to continue to expand your capacity. So, are we -- is the best way to think about this is that we're entering into a multiyear period of what I'd call elevated CapEx spending?
Walt Rosebrough: Larry, that's an excellent point and your deduction, is correct from our earlier comments, that it takes a couple years to do this. This $100 million or so this year is not the end of the tail, so we'll see some elevated capital spend over the next several years. I see an elevated revenue and profit to go with it, and that's the key point.
Lawrence Keusch: Correct. Okay, perfect. Just a couple of other quick ones. I couldn't help to notice, but on the backlog, you were, on a sequential basis, down about $30 million and, excuse me, closer to, I think, $60 million in the total backlog and about 10 percentage points higher than you typically are. So, any thoughts behind, again, that reduction in backlog this year that seems a little bit larger than the last couple of years?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. Larry, it's -- our ending backlog is kind of similar to previous years, up bit on -- up a bit growth, if you will. So, we can't -- well, we think it's kind of a normal ending backlog. We did have, as we mentioned in Q3, we did have some shipments that moved from Q3 to Q4, and a lot of that was already built. We had an extraordinary January, February this year, and so that led to a reduction in backlog. But we don't see any -- go forward, our view of the pipeline is consistent with what we've said in the past.
Mike Tokich: And Larry, this is Mike. I think I agree with you sequentially, but we've been building backlog for the first three quarters and then we did flush a lot of that out. But if you look year-over-year, in Healthcare, we are still up 16%. So, again, to Walt's point, we are starting the year at what we think is a strong backlog, strong position.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay. That makes sense. Two last ones for you guys. Just given the -- some of the comments around some, perhaps, accelerated order activity in the fiscal fourth quarter, how should we be thinking about the cadence for the 1Q? I know you talked about sort of the gating for the first half versus second half, but just any thoughts on -- that you could provide on the 1Q. And I guess lastly, for you, Walt, just M&A, obviously, the balance sheet is in great shape, below two times leverage asset valuations, feel like they are still elevated. But any sort of commentary around the landscape out there would be great.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. Larry, the only area where we have kind of comfort on the timing of the orders, the inventory fuel of our customers, is in the barrier products. We do -- we'll expect to see that because -- work its way out probably in a quarter or four or five months because that was clearly done as a result of our plant expansion, the plant -- or the plant change. We have a beautiful plant for that facility now, and that will work its way up relatively quickly. So, that one we're comfortable is in there. And it's -- that sits in the guidance that we gave in terms of the 45-55. In terms of the "Brexit numbers," that's a tougher one because, as you know, supposedly, we're Brexiting in October, but supposedly, we were Brexiting in March. And so I don't know if our customers will work their way down and then build up again in October if they don't have visibility or if they're going to just hold it until they get to October and when normal -- that one is less clear to us. In our planning, we did not take that in any significant account that is -- we took it across the year, if you will. So, in our planning, we're assuming it just kind of works its way out over the full fiscal year as opposed to any one-time thing. As we get closer to October, we'll adjust that planning, obviously. So, that's -- I think that responds to the first question. The second question is we do have -- as I mentioned before, we have a pretty robust pipeline right now in BD opportunities. The issue is opportunities don't always turn into actualities, A, in the time frame you like; or B, sometimes, other people think things will work more than we do. And then sometimes, owners decide to continue their own, and so we have the normal uncertainties. But we have a robust pipeline, and we clearly are not financially constrained in making any significant view of what we want to do.
Lawrence Keusch: Very good. Thank you very much.
Operator: And next we have Chris Cooley with Stephens.
Chris Cooley: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a great last fiscal year. Just three quick ones for me, and maybe the first, a little bit of a net. I think the only thing I can kind of question in the fourth quarter was in Life Science capital. And I know, Walt, you alluded to this in your prepared remarks. You had 21.5% growth last year, just phenomenal. But we've now declined two consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. Are there maybe alternative channels that you can start to address or categories that you might want to simulate here? Just trying to kind of re-level set expectations for Life Sciences capital. And I've got two quick follow-ups. 
Walt Rosebrough: Chris, on Life Sciences capital, your point's well taken. The good news is if we look at our backlog, it's still sitting in that $60 million-kind-of range, and so that's where we like to have it. And as you know, versus three years ago, we're way up in Life Science capital. So, this is not an area of concern we have. We do not believe this is a superfast-growing area of our business, but it is a nicely profitable piece of the business, and the service that goes along with it is nice. It is almost, I think, on the slower growth side going forward. And to your latter point, we're always looking at different opportunities in all of our businesses. And the reason we break our business as we do is -- those managers, it doesn't make any difference to them if AST is growing or not. They need to grow their business, and they're looking opportunities in that space.
Chris Cooley: Appreciate that. And then secondly, just on the free cash flow guidance for this year, it's essentially 10% of the topline, about a 3.5%, 4% free cash flow yield today, so very healthy. But just a little bit curious there. As you step up into what you alluded to as a multiyear expansion when we think about AST, how does this impact the other businesses that, I'm assuming, also require growth capital but maybe just can't candidly compete as well internally when you look at that operating margin contribution? Help us kind of square your comments about stepping up the CapEx level for what I'm assuming is essentially AST right now versus other investments that might benefit the growth of STERIS longer term via the other segments.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. Sure, Chris. I mean, first of all, our number one -- or our capital allocation philosophy hasn't changed. Our number one issue is we don't intend to cut the dividend. We generally plan to grow it roughly in line with the growth in profitability and cash flow, which tend to marry each other. The second thing is to invest in the businesses. And so if we were going to slow any capital spending down as a result of cash needs, it would be not on the current businesses we have. It would be on the M&A side, which is next in line. We do not, in any way, face capital crunch at this point in time. We like investing into businesses because we know them really well, and we tend to do what we think we're going to do in those as opposed to M&A, which we generally do where there's a little more risk. So, we are not, in any way, in a capital-constrained situation in our operating businesses. If anything, we are pushing them to find opportunities to invest more in their businesses. There's a thin line between investing and spending, and we want to -- governments tend to call spending investment. We tend to call investments investments and we expect to get a return on those -- on that, it's all cash, but on that spend. But there's no capital constraint in any of our businesses for growth capital per se. There is obviously constraint on operating expenses and other expenses in the business as there should be, but if it can generate good returns, we're happy to invest it across the line in our businesses.
Mike Tokich: And Chris, just to dig a little deeper there. We maintain -- our maintenance CapEx is around $130 million, and that's been pretty stagnant for the last couple of years. So, we are not starving any of our segments by any means from a capital standpoint. So, that allows us to, for next year, about $150 million in total CapEx growth.
Chris Cooley: Understood. Well, keep on investing rather than spending. And then I guess just lastly for me. When you look at the Healthcare Specialty Services, you got up into the double digits on a year-over-year basis for your 11% approximately op margin, approximately 15%, 14.6% to be precise. So, when we think about moving that forward now, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a mid-teens grower -- I'm sorry, a mid-teens margin. Is this now pretty consistent or will it be back -- when you think about the underlying base business plus outsourcing, is this really something that we can think about now as kind of a consistent double-digit organic grower and then those margins lifting sequentially from here? Or do I need to think about maybe something else there as kind of a counterbalance? Thanks so much.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. Chris, it really depends on the growth rates. Typically, in the outsourcing business, you do have to invest, and that investment can be both capital and expense investment. And you've seen that before. I mean it's true, basically, in all service businesses. But the outsourced can come in kind of big lumps, and if the lump comes along, it will look a lot like the AST business used to look for us 10 years or so ago. 10 years ago, every time we go to the AST plant, we saw a margin decline. And today, we have enough of them, but it just doesn't push the margins. It does push them in that plant, that plant falls, but the other -- so if we have a number of things that come along in the HSS business where we're making investments, we could see temporary decline. We don't expect that to be a permanent situation and we expect, over time, for those to grow. And we've mentioned we do believe this is a mid-teens kind of business. We put that marker out there, where we're running 3%. So, we thought that was kind of an aggressive marker. We think that's a reasonable marker. If we get to mid-teens, then we'll be thinking about 20%. But we'll worry about that when we get there.
Chris Cooley: Understood. Congrats on a great year.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Chris.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next we have Mitra Ramgopal of Sidoti. Please go ahead.
Mitra Ramgopal: Yes, hi. Good morning. Just two questions. Walt, I was just wondering, given the expansion on the AST side in terms of going global, I was wondering if there are any other areas you think you might be looking to go beyond the U.S. even more, for example, maybe opportunities on the instrument reprocessing side.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. We clearly want to look global in all of our businesses. Some businesses are more attuned to it, if you will. I mean you kind of walk through -- the AST business is quite a global business. It's roughly 50-50, U.S. and OUS, and we expect that to continue. If anything, OUS may grow a bit faster. When it comes to the Life Science business, it is also largely a global business because our Life Science customers tend to be global entities, and so we do face them globally, if you will. We're organized globally. The sales force is organized globally, and so that is very much a global business. In the Healthcare space, it is -- it's not that it's U.S. It is country by country, in large case, and so you have to organize around the countries. And it just so happens the U.S. is a big one, and that's the one we started. So, we still are quite a bit stronger in the U.S. than other places. Interestingly enough, our OUS business, if you look at it organically, our OUS business has historically grown faster than the U.S. business. It's just we keep buying things that have the same kind of footprint we do, which is heavily U.S. So, the inorganic side has grown faster in the U.S. than OUS, with the exception of Synergy, and Synergy did change our footprint a fair amount because we do outsourcing largely in the U.K. and also in Europe. So -- but at a high level, yes, we're attuned in any market where that -- if we use the market loosely, any country where they're accepting the type of services that we do and we're looking for ways to amend our products and services such that they're more acceptable outside the United States.
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. Thanks. No, that's great. And then just going back to margins. Again, we saw improvement across all the segments. And I know, aside from incremental volume and pricing, et cetera, you highlighted, I think, expense management on the Life Sciences side and I think some improvement activity on the HSS side. I was just wondering if you can just provide a little more color on that in terms of -- if we should be expecting more of the same in fiscal 2020.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. I mean generally speaking, we expect -- there are certain areas we know we have opportunities to reduce expenses, and we go at those significantly in a way where we're targeting expense management. In general, we just expect as -- there's variable costs and fixed costs. The variable costs, you have to take active management to cause them to be reduced. The fixed costs, you have to actively manage them not to grow. And we do work at that, but like all things, there's some growth -- fixed isn't really fixed. It's just where we kind of think about it, so we have to manage that. But in general, our expectation is when we're doing things that, if we grow, we should become more efficient as we grow, so our costs, particularly the fixed costs, should grow less quickly than the variable costs and that's kind of at a high level of how we manage.
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. Thanks again for taking the questions.
Operator: And next we have a follow-up from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.
Lawrence Keusch: Yes. Mike, just one quick follow-up here. So, the guidance, as you indicated, for fiscal 2020 does not include any impact of the medical device tax potentially coming back in your last fiscal quarter. To the extent that it were to come back, again, that's sort of 2.3%, can you remind us sort of how it was running for you guys in the past just to help us calibrate some thoughts around that?
Mike Tokich: Yes. Larry, so as you said, we do not anticipate it coming back in our fourth quarter. And what we had seen in the past is about $3 million negative impact on a quarterly basis. So, that will give you at least, from a modeling standpoint, what our thoughts are.
Lawrence Keusch: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Mike Tokich: You're welcome.
Operator: Well, so no further questions at this time. We will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to the management team for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks everybody for joining us and for your continued support of STERIS. We look forward to seeing many of you out on the road in the coming weeks.
Operator: And we thank you ma'am and to the rest of management team for your time also today. Again the conference call has now concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you. Take care and have a great day everyone.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-02-12 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone, and welcome to the STERIS Plc Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Julie Winter. Ms. Winter, please go ahead.

Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 6.9% driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points to 42.7% and was impacted favorably by currency, price and the impact of divestitures somewhat offset by higher labor costs and the impact of tariffs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 20.8% of revenue, a substantial increase from second quarter levels and 20 basis points better than the third quarter last year. EBIT margin was negatively impacted in the quarter by 40 basis points due to higher than anticipated calendar year end employee healthcare benefits claims activity causing an increase in SG&A for the quarter. The adjusted effect of tax rate in the quarter was 18.9% somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 11% to $107.2 million and earnings increased 13% to $1.26 per diluted share benefiting from both revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $225 million of cash at $1.25 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $50.7 million. Given our spending to-date and plans for the fourth quarter we are reducing our expectations for capital expenditures by $10 million to approximately $180 million for the full fiscal year 2019. As a reminder during the third quarter, we announced a restructuring plan that will generate profit improvement of approximately $12 million over the next two years. In addition, we adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out of the usage of a trade name associated with certain products in the Healthcare Products segment. These two items have resulted in a significant increase in depreciation and amortization for the quarter. Unlike the P&L, we do not adjust the balance sheet nor free cash flow for these items. Hence, depreciation and amortization for the quarter was significantly higher at $82.7 million primarily due to $36 million have accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with both the restructuring plan and the branding strategy. Free cash flow for the first nine months increased to $252.9 million mainly due to improvements in cash from operations. We are updating the full fiscal year 2019 free cash flow expectation to include higher working capital requirements, costs associated with our plan to redomicile to Ireland, and restructuring plan costs. Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $330 million for the year. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Michael, and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2019 is shaping up to be a strong year for STERIS fueled by solid demand from our customers in all four segments. For the first three quarters we’re ahead of our expectations for revenue growth and as a result are increasing our full year constant currency organic revenue growth expectations to be approximately 6%. Each of our business segments have contributed nicely to our revenue growth so far this year. AST and Healthcare Specialty Services are leading the way with 8% constant currency organic revenue growth year-to-date. In AST we continue to see solid underlying demand from our core medical device customers. Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment continues to exceed our revenue expectations driven primarily by strength in the United States. Their profitability has improved as planned as we have successfully leveraged the investments made over the past year or so. Healthcare products, constant currency organic revenue has grown 7% so far this year with strength in both recurring revenues and capital equipment. Even with the growth in capital equipment shipments, our healthcare backlog has also grown nicely and is anticipated to ship over the next few quarters. We expect a solid fourth quarter in healthcare capital shipments. And finally, Life Science constant currency organic revenue has grown 5% year-to-date with growth across the business. Our fourth quarter last year was a strong record quarter for Life Science capital equipment shipments which we do not expect to replicate this year. Backlog has stayed relatively steady versus last year and certainly above our historic levels which gives us comfort that the underlying trends we have experienced over the last year or so will continue. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect our overall constant currency organic revenue growth to be approximately 6% for fiscal 2019. As a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver another record year with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.74 to $4.84. I will note that when we raised our outlook this range last quarter, our thinking was that the effective tax rate would come in around 20%. With continued favorability on the tax rate in the third quarter due to favorable discrete items, we will likely have a modest upside on the effective tax rate for the fiscal year, but not certain enough or substantial enough to reguide that rate. We appreciate your taking the time to join us this morning and your continued support of STERIS. I will turn the call over to Julie to open for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you Walt, and Mike for your comments. Jamie, we're ready to start Q&A if you've give the instructions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Hsu from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
John Hsu: Maybe you could start with the guidance, the organic revenue guidance, I think it implies a pretty decent deceleration in the fourth quarter, so what's driving that? The comp looks to be pretty consistent with the third quarter but is it just conservatism or is there any other - anything else that you can point to maybe from a segment standpoint?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure, John. A couple of points that I would make, first of all, we've been talking about for a long time that we're trying to move our revenue pattern to be a little bit away from the fourth quarter. We traditionally have a very strong fourth quarter. We like to run our factories more level loaded to the extent possible and as a result we've been trying to pull that forward. We've had some success with that this year, and so I do expect relatively speaking as you know we've been strong the first three quarters, we may not be quite as strong relative to historic growth period last year, so that's one item. I will mention there's one less shipping day this year than last year and that doesn't have a big effect on capital equipment but it does have some affect on the recurring revenue, and I would say you're probably correct. We may be being a bit conservative because we do have a situation where the end of March happens to fall on a Saturday, Sunday, we don't like to run our plants of shipping on Saturdays and Sundays. And secondly we have Brexit coming March 29 which is two days before our fiscal year and there's someone certainty about how the patterns or shipments will relate as to that. So we probably are being a bit conservative in our forecast, we're quite comfortable to 6% but we'll see how the end of the month of March turns out.
John Hsu: And then I guess taking a step back, your organic growth probably call it over the last 5 years or so is probably been in the 4% to 6% range. This year you're now guiding 6%, you mentioned there's actually one less shipping day. I believe there's actually another 50 basis points of Sterilmed contract that you're also hurdling. So I guess just taking all those pieces, are you at a point where you believe you can drive consistent organic growth at the 6% range or better?
Mike Tokich: I think it's early for us to be saying we're going to move above or kind of 4% to 6% long-term target. Clearly we're at the top end of that right now. We could possibly tip over a little bit but I think it's early to say that we're - we're looking at our next year's plan as we speak now. We'll talk more about next year and beyond at that time.
John Hsu: And then last one from me on cash flows, I think you're very clear that on some of the changes in cash flow from operations, higher working capital, plans to redomicile and then restructuring but specifically on the CapEx pieces, can you talk about what's driving the reduction in CapEx by $10 million versus prior guidance?
Mike Tokich: Yes, John, it's mostly due to timing of projects. We set out a goal at the beginning of the year and we're just behind our original plans from a timing perspective. It's nothing more than that.
John Hsu: And sorry, just a quick follow-up to that, just obviously you've baked in some big things of investment for outsourcing projects and I believe there is an upfront CapEx cost associated with that. So just kind of relative to your comments, Mike, is everything tracking in line as far as the $10 million in revenue that you were expecting from outsourcing for the year?
Mike Tokich: Actually as you can see from the - that business, the Specialty Service business in healthcare in the United States, they're just having an outstanding year in growth and they're having it on both sides of the equation, the Instrument Management business is growing nicely and the Outsourcing business is growing actually slightly ahead of our expectations. So this year we had forecast about $10 million growth. As we sit here today we've already exceeded that number and so we fully expect to - obviously we're going to meet or beat that objective. So it's going quite nicely for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
David Turkaly: Primarily, you got asked the question on the guidance, the $12 million, the profit improvement from the restructuring over 2 years, I was wondering if you can comment on how that should flow through the P&L? And specifically as we're looking at that gross margin line, what can we expect? Any color you might give looking forward in terms of sort of directionally it sounds like we should be moving higher but any specific comment you might want to make about how that flows through would be great?
Mike Tokich: So, we anticipate that that $12 million will happen over the next 2 years. About majority of it actually happened in the second year, next year in our fiscal year we anticipate that'll it be more backend loaded as we are just starting our plans and implanting our plans to close and consolidate our manufacturing facilities and do some product rationalization that will take some time. So I would say they'd be more back half loaded next year and then the bulk of it will happen in FY 2021, the bulk of the savings.
David Turkaly: And I guess we haven't seen - I had a question about the M&A side and I know you get asked this a lot but given the environment that we're seeing out there and sort of your plans looking ahead I guess any color, any update on how we might roll into next fiscal year, anything you see in that that might get you back on the board on the M&A side?
Mike Tokich: We have an active funnel. Again, most of what is active is what I would call tuck-ins, things that are relatively small compared to the businesses they're tucking into. And that's actually our favorite type of acquisition, so we've had a few of those this year and we have a good pipeline going forward. In terms of a more significant acquisition, there are things we're looking at. We have been for some time. There are two issues in concert, one is, again, there are possibilities but not all those possibilities can we take unilateral action. Many times there are private companies that have that decision to make themselves. And secondly, as we've discussed before, right now the market is fairly high in price across the board and so we want to be careful not to overpay for something that we may purchase. So it's a combination of those two things I think that have caused us not to have a purchase in the last little bit but you should not be surprised if we do something significant tomorrow morning and you should not be surprised if we don't do it one next year. It's just a matter of the timing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Isaac Ro: Well, just maybe want to clarify your comments on the implied outlook for fiscal fourth quarter. It sounded like a lot of the items you talked about had to do with timing and maybe just a little bit of conservatism but I just want to clarify that you're seeing no change in spending pattern in your end markets, just want to maybe look at it from the demand side.
Walt Rosebrough: Isaac, you read that absolutely correctly. From the demand side in fact I would say this is all more than supply side if you will than the demand side. All of our units are experiencing solid growth from the demand side. We anticipate continuation, day-and-half or a day less which is a point-and-half on the consumable side if everything runs to the number of days, you know that's just a calendar timing issue. The balance if anything given again the uncertainty of Brexit there is people pulling things ahead and pushing things behind to accommodate that. And our plans are running pretty hot. And so if a couple of orders particularly capital orders slip, the wrong two days out of the year or end of the year that can have a fairly significant effect on those growth rates in a given quarter, but in terms of pipeline we see no difference in the healthcare capital pipeline then we've talked about now for probably 18 months or so. And on the consumable side we have seen no difference in the ordering patterns. So I would not suggest - I guess I’ll say differently I think our full year numbers are more reflective of what we have seen and are still seeing in the pipeline then what might be implied by the fourth quarter.
Isaac Ro: Okay, that’s helpful context. And just a follow up on the expense side and really kind of in two parts one on the P&L and one then on the free cash guide. I'm kind of curious on the redomiciling effort you have there. Could you talk about whether or not those incremental costs on the free cash guidance kind of run rate into fiscal 2020 or is sort of one-time thing that sunsets once you're done with the move and if someone is that happen. And then on the OpEx side, I think you mentioned that margins were hit a little bit by benefits related items. Could you tells us a little bit more about what that was and the extent to which that carries through into next year as well?
Mike Tokich: Yes, certainly Isaac. In regards to the Ireland redomicile most of the expenses will be incurred this fiscal year both from a P&L standpoint which are adjusted out and a cash standpoint which we do not adjust out. We anticipate early on that it would cost us about $5 million impact right now that estimate has been revised to about $10 million which is one of the reasons we are taking down free cash flow. In addition to that, the healthcare claims activity that we talked about is we were little bit surprised by the level of claims activity in the fourth or in the calendar fourth quarter as we seem to be moving a lot of our employees to high deductible claims. And once they hit their deductible as anybody would, they would take advantage of hitting that deductable and going through additional procedures if required or if needed. So we were a little bit surprised by the claims activity. And as I mentioned that was about an impact of 40 basis points to our EBIT margin so it was pretty significant for us in our third quarter.
Walt Rosebrough: But Isaac I would not characterize that as a significant change when you look at it over the course of the year, I do think it's a timing adjustment. We've been seeing that and we do this on actuarial basis so the actuaries are always a bit behind but I would not expect that to be a significant effect for the full year if you look at just over the nine months is that particularly significant I think as we go to the 12 months we will find that the same.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Please go with your question.
Jason Rodgers: Regarding your HSS segment nice operating leverage in the quarter and wonder if you could talk about that going forward and how we should think about further investments in that segments compared to what you saw this quarter?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, we've talked about that in the past and I don't feel a difference in view at this point in time. Again on the outsource reprocessing business in general it's still relatively small. So as we make investments there will be more fluctuation on a quarter-to-quarter basis maybe even on a year-to-year basis, but over the long term we see that being kind of mid double - another way to say is mid-teens is probably the best way to say it. Mid-teens kind of return on sales type business so we don't feel differently about that. Obviously we invested early as we said we're doing late in late last year and early this year as we said we were going to that impacted - the margins early, and they are now flowing through almost exactly as expected except they are a bit ahead on revenue so it's a little better on a dollar basis. So, and again I think you will see some fluctuations as we move forward. If you talk specifically about the ORC business but having said that when you combine it with the instrument repair business it moderate those fluctuations a bit because that business is larger. So in total we don't feel any differently about that then we’ve been saying now for a couple of years.
Jason Rodgers: And then Walt wonder if you could just provide some thoughts on hospital spending globally if you are seeing any material change from what you said last quarter?
Walt Rosebrough: Really the short answer is no significant change in the pipeline that we see – first of all are backlog as you can see is at record levels and record by a pretty significant differential. And so in terms of shipments that pretends well for the next little bit, but our pipeline also continues to stay solid. So we’re feeling pretty good about the in healthcare we don't have quite the visibility we do in Life Science, Life Science has a longer pipeline but still beat on large projects. We see things out 18 to 24 months they may not materialize in the timeframe that we like but what we see out there in pipeline looks quite healthy to us.
Jason Rodgers: And then Mike as far as the tax rate you have an estimate for the fourth quarter and maybe in yearly thoughts for fiscal 2020?
Mike Tokich: Yes, as we have continued to say approximately 20% for the full year is going to be our effective tax rate. We did get some favorability this quarter in particular due to some stock com deductions that we typically plan zero and we did have some compensation related to stocks and equity options that were exercise during the quarter which obviously helped us. But we still think in the low 20s or 20% approximately is the range that we would look at for the fourth quarter and we will guide in May timeframe as we look out to next year.
Jason Rodgers: And then do you have what the current debt to EBITDA is and what is the target for that?
Mike Tokich: Yes, we are currently just under two times levered remember we took up leverage to about 2.9 times with the acquisition of synergy just over three years ago and we've been talking about working to bring that down somewhere in the low two ranges. We really don't have a specific target per se but we feel comfortable operating at the levels that we are.
Walt Rosebrough: You may recall that STERIS historically was well under two for a long time, we have taken those debt levels up. I think if you look at the capital structure the optimum capital structure most of our bankers would say sit someplace between 1.5 and 2.5 and it’s fairly flat. So we don't feel pressure at this point on a capital structure issue in terms of what our debt rates are across the capital is. So it's pretty flat between 1.5 and 2.5 and very flat between 1.6/1.7 and 2.3/2.4. So we don't feel pressure there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Cooley: Just a couple from me at this point Walt would you help us a little bit with AST in the quarter that the first time we've seen 40 plus percent on margins. And you did it growing 6% off a very tough high teens comp in the prior year. Could you just talk to us a little bit about what's driving that upside to the op margin in AST is that utilization of the capacity that you brought on here over the last 12 months. Is that a change in mix that we're starting to see just one kind of level set expectations there for the contribution margin from AST going forward. And I've got a couple quick follow ups?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, Chris a couple of comments the underlying driver is the growth in the business and as you guys who follow medical devices know that most of the device makers are having a pretty solid quarters. And so when they do we tend to, to because I mean that's the ultimate demand of that business. We have expanded geographically and we've expanded our capabilities and we’ve talked about that and those expansions are paying off as we bring things online. They tend to have a negative effect on our margins because we have in great depreciation and early start up costs, but now that we have 60 some odd plants and the individual plant tends to have less of that impact. And we have seen our utilization rates out run our expectations for this year. And so we're getting to where a lot of our plants are running fairly high. I wouldn't suggest that I mean numbers between those high 30s and low 40s. I wouldn't suggest that those are not kind of a normal run rate for that business. We do spend a lot of capital to make that money so the ROICs are attractive but not stupendous. So, I wouldn't suggest that those are not but you will see fluctuations around that range. I wouldn't say we'll always be over 40 but I wouldn't bet my life against it either.
Chris Cooley: Understood, appreciate it, still great performance there. And I guess the only real nip, when you look at the quarter, the Life Science backlog and I realized last year we had phenomenal growth there. I think it was up 43% in the prior year quarter before being down 7% on a year-over-year basis this time and up one sequentially. But are we starting - I'm trying to kind of get out here is what's kind of the normalized capital growth rate? Are we going to essentially go back to that mid-single digit Life Science capital growth kind of having worked through a lot of these projects from retooling enhancement that had been put off and we've seen that kind of driving growth here over the course of the last 2 years, is that - is it starting to normalize a bit there or if not why should I think that this would start to turn up on a year-over-year basis as we go into fiscal 20.
Mike Tokich: Chris, I think your comment and question is excellent and we've been saying for some time you know we don't really expect 30%, 40% growth rates in this business. When it, it jumped very strong about I guess now 2 years ago, it started headed up and those 20%, 30% kind of percent growth rates we don't anticipate staying that way. Our bigger, I'll call it concern or thought was jeez it's going to stand up at this level or you know we're going to - this is a one time, we're going to drop down from that and we don't think so. Even though again just like shipments are kind of lumpy in Life Science, backlog is kind of lumpy in Life Science because the order is come in the same way the shipments go out kind of in big chunks. As it turns out as we speak today our backlog is roughly the same as it was last year which was down a bit at the end of December but in the January we're right back to - within a $1 million I don't remember of where we were last year. So to us it looks steady state, so I don't expect a big down turn, nor do I expect a big upturn but all things being equal looks kind of a steady state.
Chris Cooley: Super. And then just lastly from me, so I make sure I picked up on this correctly. When I look at the cash flow, your original guide was 340 now 330 but kind of when you're reconciling the two, you did have an additional $5 million there in expense to redomicile to Ireland. You do have additional $5 million in headwinds you kind of called out there. So in essence I'm looking at it if that's the $10 million with the offset of course or the reduction in the timing of CapEx. So just trying to go back to that 340 to kind of just working my way back, that's - those are the two essential driving factors, am I correct in thinking about that way?
Mike Tokich: Yes, there's actually three driving factors, Chris. There is the increase in the redomicile expenses by about $5 million. There's also some restructuring costs from a cash perspective again about $5 million, and then on top of that we have additional working capital requirements mostly inventory as our backlog is high and as everybody knows not all that backlog is going to shift in Q4. So some of that will carry over in Q1, but we have to start building that product as we've got about $10 million in increased inventory there. So that helps you reconcile and then take the $10 million of reduction and CapEx and that gets you to roughly the 340 than the 330.
Chris Cooley: So the underlying leverage there clearly not tapering, it's just those different factors offsetting each other partially…
Mike Tokich: Exactly. And as you know we do not adjust like we do on the P&L. So the restructuring in the Ireland get adjusted on the P&L but we do continue to account for those in the free cash flow and on the balance sheet.
Walt Rosebrough: And Chris I would I would add this, as we said, we have demand to ship more than we are now forecasting we would ship. It's a matter of ability to match the orders, it's not can we make it, it's just if a customer calls up a week before the end of the year and says, "Hey, I need to delay this two weeks because my construction is not going as anticipated." They usually don't do it a week before but a month before. We've already built the product and as a result if it's - particularly there are certain products that are specific to the job and so we forecasted, we put in our forecast that some of that does slide into next year which is why the revenue - same conversation we had on revenue to start with that that ends up being inventory. So that's the logic.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan: On the ORC centers, congratulation on getting that revenue in the U.S. up and running. You mentioned that there were three centers that you had contracted. Are one, two or three of those open right now and then can you say whether or not you have more than three contracted open at some point now?
Walt Rosebrough: Matt, one, two, or three of those are open right now and…
Matthew Mishan: Thanks for the detail.
Walt Rosebrough: As I mentioned last time Matt, we're not going to talk about specific customers, we never have liked doing that early on this process when people were you know - when it was absolutely a start up, we talked about orders of magnitude the kind of numbers - and so we're going to get away from the individual contracts. The answer to your question is, yes. We have multiple contracts up and running. Some of those are full ORC. When you would think of as a full ORC, some of those are places where we are doing the work, we're outsourcing the work, we're outsourcing it inside their facility, some of which we may only capital some of which they may only capital. And we have a number of places where we are beginning that walk by taking a piece of their business and over time we would anticipate taking more and more. So if there's a full spectrum of outsourcing in this ORC business, some of which is - what you would think of as a traditional standalone ORC but just as we do in the U.K. In the U.K. we have a certain customers where we do all the work in a center that's off their site and we are trucking it back and forth but we have a number of centers where we're doing the work inside their site and outsourcing the work. So it's very much like the U.K. model and it is progressing nicely across the various fronts that we can grow at. We're not going to continue to break that down into details. All I can - what I will say is we've already achieved our yearly target so we're obviously going to go over it and we're quite comfortable in this business.
Matthew Mishan: And this is a new model for the U.S. Can you give us a sense of how the transition is gone with those customers as you moved it from their facilities or their operations to yours?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, well, like all transition some of them are little testy and some of are easy. And it is work and that's why in a number of these cases we're not trying to transition the whole thing at once both we and our customers think the idea of moving pieces is not a bad plan and then you do more and more the next thing you know you're fully across. There are other places where their capacity is absolute, and then we have to rebuild if you will and so building the center off site as opposed to sticking it in the middle of their hospital is - it's better for them to have an offsite for any number of possible reasons and so then it's more of a transition as you would think of it. But even then it's not like you turn the switch off in the facility and a switch on in the other facility and a 100% moves. That would be a bridge too far. So it typically is over the course of time.
Matthew Mishan: And then the Walt, I know not to take every word literally and I know you mentioned you wouldn't be surprised if you were to close a significant deal tomorrow or not within the next year but just what would you consider to be a significant deal? And does that mean you're actually looking at several like significant deals in the pipeline?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, Matt, I guess I think of orders of magnitude I think that tuck-ins, things that are 10% or less the size of the business that we are putting them in if you will, I think of those as kind of tuck-ins and then if it's bigger than either for a specific business or for STERIS as a whole, those are more significant deals and we are looking at some in that order of magnitude, but we've been looking at those some of those even looking at for a long time, some of those are newer to us. I don't see a big differential in that pipeline even over the course to last five to 10 years. The only difference is we're getting bigger and so in some sense that shrinks - it doesn't shrink the number of deals tuck-in it opens wider the number of possible deals but it shrinks those that are greater than 10% or either the individual businesses or ours. So it’s a category switch not an overall pipeline question.
Matthew Mishan: And then just last one, Mike how confident are you that you captured all the changes in tax reform in that low 20s guidance. And is the way to think about it is you have the low 20s but then on any given year depending upon where stock comes in you probably have an extra 100 basis points to cushion in that.
Mike Tokich: We could depending on the volumes of the exercises from a stock comp standpoint that definitely as we have seen this year has been more favorable than we originally anticipated. And as far as capturing what has been published at least at this point in time that is finalized under the Tax Cut Jobs Act. I would say that we are very confident that we have captured all the pieces. Now there's proposals out there obviously we can't speak to those because those are final, but whatever is final we are very comfortable.
Matthew Mishan: All right, thank you Mike.
Mike Tokich: You're welcome.
Walt Rosebrough: If we could get tax laws around the world to stop changing, we would be very confident with our forecast.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And at this point I'm showing no additional questions. I like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thanks again everybody for joining us today, and all of your continued support at STERIS. We’ll talk to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen the conference call has concluded. We do thank you for joining today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS's SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth, and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in today's release, including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 9.1%, driven by volume and 70 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points to 42.1% and was impacted favorably by price, currency and divestitures, offset by a revenue mix shift towards capital equipment and investments in our outsource reprocessing in the United States. EBIT margin for the quarter was 18.8% of revenue, a slight decline from the prior year primarily due to lower gross margin as well as increases in R&D of about $2 million. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.5%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete item adjustments and the refinement of our estimates based on the IRS clarifying components of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result, we now expect the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Our early thinking for fiscal 2020 is that our annual effective tax rate will remain near the low 20s percent. Net income in the quarter grew 17% to $93.6 million or $1.10 per diluted share, benefiting from both revenue growth and the lower effective tax rate. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended September with $210 million of cash and $1.27 billion in total debt. Free cash flow for the first half increased to $169.7 million, mainly due to the increase in net income and the timing of capital spending. During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $34.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $46.1 million. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, all. I hope you've all voted in the midterm elections already this morning and if not, that you will. As you heard from Mike, we had another good quarter, exceeding our expectations for constant currency organic revenue growth, with strength across all segments of our business. Leading the way, Healthcare Products constant currency organic revenue grew 11% for the quarter, with double-digit growth in capital equipment and 6% growth in service. Even with these impressive numbers, capital backlog remains strong, ending the quarter $50 million higher than the same time last year. While we continue to be optimistic about the uptick in demand for our capital equipment, we also recognize that capital sales can be lumpy. And that we had relatively easy comparisons with Q2 last year. We continue to feel good about our expectations of mid-single-digit growth in healthcare capital equipment sales for the year and believe that underlying fundamentals in hospital capital equipment purchases remain stable. In Healthcare Consumables, year-over-year revenue comparisons continue to be impacted by divestitures. Excluding the impact of the divested businesses, Healthcare Consumables organic revenue increased double-digits. Our operating profit in this segment improved nicely, benefiting from the increased volume and currency, which was somewhat offset by continued investments in R&D as we had planned. Life Sciences constant currency organic revenue grew 9% in Q2, with growth across the business. As we noted last quarter, we had a timing issue with Life Sciences capital equipment shipments in Q1 which resolved itself nicely in our second quarter with 27% growth in capital equipment revenue. As a reminder, heading into our second half, our comparisons for capital equipment in this segment get more challenging. We expect our shipments to remain strong, but the year-over-year growth rates will be impacted by last year's success. EBIT margin dipped a bit in Life Sciences this quarter which is expected given the higher mix shift to capital equipment. Our AST segment had another good quarter with 8% constant currency organic revenue growth stemming from increased demand from our core medical device customers. Our facility expansions continue to pay off and we expect ongoing capacity expansions in the most appropriate places around the globe going forward. EBIT margins improved nicely on the AST volume growth. And finally, Healthcare Specialty Services constant currency organic revenue grew 7% during the second quarter against difficult comparisons in the prior year. As we discussed at the beginning of our fiscal year, we are working on a number of opportunities for outsourced reprocessing in the U.S. Investments in these new ORC opportunities are reflected in the segment's lower operating income year-over-year as we anticipated. Even with the planned investments we are making across all of our businesses we were able to grow adjusted earnings per diluted share 17% year-over-year to $1.10 in the second quarter. Based on our revenue outperformance in the second quarter and our plans for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full-year outlook for constant currency organic revenue growth to 5% to 6%. We recognize that our first half growth rate is somewhat higher than that, but the outperformance of our Healthcare Products business in the second quarter is not anticipated to repeat, and we have tough comparisons in Life Sciences and AST in the second half. We have a large backlog of capital equipment to manufacture and ship as well as outsourced reprocessing centers starting up in the U.S. in the second half. So, our revenue forecast recognizes our efforts to run our plants at normalized run rates throughout the year as well as some risk for potential timing issues in capital equipment shipments and outsourced reprocessing center start-up revenue. A substantial portion of our forecasted overachievement on revenue for the full year has already been achieved with higher capital equipment growth in the second quarter, which caused the natural narrowing of profit margins as we discussed. We also have currency flipping from a favorable impact on profitability in the first half to a neutral impact in the second half as well as the impact of tariffs and labor rates, which we have discussed before, and which we plan to absorb with additional volume and efficiency efforts. As a result, we think that our full-year operating margins will be about as we originally expected. With all these factors considered, in addition to the lower effective tax rate that Mike has previously discussed, we are increasing our expectations for adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.84, reflecting 14% to 17% growth over fiscal 2018, another record year. Before we open for questions, I do want to spend a minute on our plan to redomicile to Ireland, which of course depends upon shareholder approval. As you know, we redomiciled to the UK when we closed the Synergy combination, and we put a structure in place that allowed us to benefit from certain European Union tax and other arrangements. Along with most of the world, we certainly did not expect Brexit at that time, and the subsequent uncertainty surrounding Brexit, simply put, significant benefits are at risk if we remain domiciled in a country that is no longer a member of the EU. As a result, we looked at several alternatives and determined that redomiciling to Ireland is the best path forward for STERIS to preserve the current and future benefits established at the time of the Synergy Health combination. We've provided extensive information regarding this in our S-4 which was filed with the SEC today. So please see our S-4 for additional information. With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Julie, please open the call for Q&A.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Mike and Walt for your comments. Austin, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started.
Operator: Absolutely. And our first question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks. There have been some changes in the competitive landscape from some of your key players in the U.S. Could you give us a little sense of what you saw this quarter, to the extent there was any interesting behavior there, and really how you're game planning that throughout the rest of the fiscal year.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: There hasn't been a great deal of change yet. There have been some changes and some forecast. Obviously, the ASP business of J&J being acquired or we believe being acquired sometime late this year or early next year by Fortive, but again, Fortive has yet to take that business into their management hands. So I don't think we've seen overly significant competitive change there. I can't think of anything else that is a truly significant change in competitive situation or behavior.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe on the margin side. Obviously, all companies are dealing with some degree of FX headwind. As you think about where you've built in a little bit of dry powder, if you will, into the margin plan for this year, are there any levers that you're pulling on a little harder now, as we kind of move into the core of your fiscal year? Or are you kind of steady as she goes and just passing through the FX headwind as is?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yeah, I mean I would characterize most of our work as being steady as she goes. Having said that, we – kind of there are two operational levers that we naturally work on. One is just general improvement through lean and the other is insourcing components, which is partially a function of lean. As we get – as we free up capacity in our plants, we can then insource more of our production. Both of those are running. We have accelerated them a little bit. But in truth, we would have accelerated them just as much. So, the – our improvement there is allowing us to cover the headwinds we have in currency. But I wouldn't say that it happened as a result of the currency headwinds.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great and thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on a nice quarter. I guess I asked the same questions last quarter, but I like them and so, I'm going to ask them again. Any updates to the ORC contracts? How are the launches progressing? And is quoting still active? And is there still a lot of interest?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Good morning, Matt. Well I'll reverse the order of the questions, I guess. First of all, yes, we do have – and I'm not sure quoting is exactly the right term, but we do have activity going on in terms of conversations with different entities about ORC potentials. And there's a wide range of those from, I'll call it, relatively smaller peak capacity kind of things where they're at capacity and don't have an ability to add in the short to intermediate term. And so, we have a number of those kind of projects out there as well as the more extensive ones where we would be taking over either in their facility or outside their facility or a combination of the two to run the entire process. So, there are a number of those out there. I wouldn't say the activity has picked up, but it hasn't slowed down. So, we continue to see activity. In terms of the individual ORCs, we continue to feel the same as we have felt historically. We still feel that that piece of business that we know about and is coming will generate something on the order of $50 million revenue out in the out years. Of course, as you come in closer to it, as projects get started, some of them start a little later, some of them start a little earlier, how that evens out, we don't have a strong opinion on. But plus or minus we feel that we're in the same ballpark as we suggested earlier in the year.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Are you planning on giving a running update on annualized contract volume in HSS for that business or was that a one-time thing for you?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I would not expect that we would do that. We'll just give forecasts of revenue. There are a number of contracts both in place and moving forward, and some of them as I said, are these smaller kinds of contracts which we really haven't spent a lot of time talking about because most people have been focused on the several larger ones. But it gets harder and harder to put that together in a way that makes sense; and as we get started and they're moving forward, I don't think we'll be doing that. We will obviously talk about what our overall feeling is about growth rates in that space, meaning the ORC space, versus the instrument space because those are two kind of different pieces of the business. But I don't think we'll be – first of all, we don't typically want to give individual customer information out, both for their and our reasons; and secondly, in general, it's going to get messier and messier to do that.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. I think that's more than fair. And on the other side of the ocean in that business, any pressures you're seeing in the UK as kind of Brexit talks are progressing on that business? And then I remember you were also talking about bringing instrument repairs and additional service on top of your presence there. How is that going?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: You are correct, Matt, that both – part of our general strategy was to do more instrument repair in Europe and more ORC in America. And both of those are in relatively infant phases, but both of them have traction. So – and again, I don't think we'll be getting into details on that on either side of the ocean really. But in general, we are beginning to see that. The second question is related to Brexit. Really our – I don't think that there's pressure per se as a result of Brexit. We are concerned about the movement of people because obviously there are a number of – a significant number of Europeans in the UK. Our assumption is that both the Europeans and the people in the UK will want to allow that to continue, and I think most parties believe that will continue, but that would be a concern to us going forward if that becomes problematic. And then, really the only other pressure is the – we have had some cost pressure in that the NHS raised the cost of labor this past year. And I don't remember the exact numbers, but it was well above inflationary rates, instead of 2% or 3%, maybe 5% or 6% percent, something like that. And since that's a – labor's a significant opponent, we are having to offset that with improvements in productivity.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, if I can just squeeze one last one in, and then sorry for the guys behind me. You haven't talked about US Endoscopy in a while, and there seems to be a lot of changes going on in that space. How are they performing and kind of how big are they now as a percentage of your Healthcare Consumables?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Matt, they are continuing to do fantastic. They continue to grow in line with our expectations. When we bought them, they were about $70 million and they are more than double that at this point time. So, progressing very well. Probably one of the – I wish I could do 10 of those acquisitions from a US Endoscopy standpoint. But yeah, you don't hear us talk about it because it is doing so well.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Mike, you just do two of them and I'll be happy.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Thanks, Matt (19:12). Oh, he's gone.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead.
David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit about what you're seeing on the hospital spending side of the business. What are your trends looking like, and what do you feel like the stage of the cycle we're in, even though it's not very cyclical? I mean, just any color you can give on the future as we're going forward and possibly changing political environments.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I've been saying for some time now that hospital capital spending continues to be stable to positive, which in some sense is a little surprising in that there's been a fair amount of uncertainty the last several years what's going on in healthcare reimbursement and all the issues with Obamacare and all those things that are going on. But I think hospitals, when I talk to hospital executives, they are pretty much resigned to the fact that uncertainty is their future. And so I think uncertainty is now less of a concern than it has been in the past. The second issue I would say is we know in the 2008-2009 time period there was a significant drop in healthcare capital spending. And then there was also a ton of money spent on information systems because the government gave a pretty significant incentive to spend money on information systems and get those systems up. As a result, there probably was a bit of crowding out of other capital spending. So I do think some of this is a gradual – whatever you want to call it, latent demand issue. So that's I think kind of the nature of things as we speak today. As we look out, we look out at projects 18 to 24 months that you recall that about two-thirds of our business is roughly – two-thirds is I'll call it, routine replacement of capital spending where you just – something gets too old or wears out, they need a new one. And then about a third of our business is where they're managing a large project, either building a new hospital, which is relatively rare, or where they are revamping or remodeling a tower that may include several ORs and the central sterile department. Those projects, we see 18 to 24 months out and the others, we see more near-term, 6 to 12 months out. And both of those pipelines still appear to be quite strong in our view. So, we see them steady to increasing at this point in time. So, we're feeling quite good about capital spending. The other thing I should mention and this is included in that numbers I've just shared – that description I'd given, is both hospitals and non-hospital entities are building more and more ambulatory surgery centers or things that look like that, micro hospitals or ambulatory surgery centers. And those all require both operating room type equipment, as well as the central sterile type equipment. So, both of those we see as positive for our piece of capital spending. So, when you put that all together, we're feeling pretty good right now.
David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review: Great. Thanks for all the detail. That was it for me.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Austin. Thank all of you who did join us for participating. I know it's a busy day with a lot of earnings calls and we do appreciate your time. Happy to take any follow-up calls you got today and look forward to seeing many of you at the Stephens Conference tomorrow.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the STERIS Plc first quarter 2019 conference call. Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Julie Winter, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. As usual, on today's call we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO, and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I do have just a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS's securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS's SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth, and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in today's release, including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. It is, once again, my pleasure to be with you to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 5.3%, driven by volume and 80 basis points of price. Gross margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 42.3% and was impacted favorably by price and divestitures, largely offset by the impact of currency changes and our investments in outsourced reprocessing. During the first quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard relating to the classification of retirement benefit plan costs. The new standard reclasses components of benefit plan expenses between operating expense and non-operating expense. While this change has no impact on net income, it does have a negative impact of about 20 basis points on EBIT margin in the prior year, which has been recast in our press release and financial tables. Reflecting that change, EBIT margin for the quarter at 17.9% of revenue, representing a 40 basis point improvement. EBIT margin expansion was limited somewhat by our investments in both our IMS business and in R&D in our healthcare products business. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.8%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to the benefit related to stock compensation expenses. We continue to expect the full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%, as our first quarter tends to be lower than the full year. Net income in the quarter grew 17% to $85.6 million or $1.00 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate. Walt will cover our segment performance in his comments momentarily, but I do want to point out that we have changed the way we report segment operating profit to align with how we manage the business. As a result, similar to many of our peers, we no longer include certain corporate cost allocations in segment operating profit. We have provided a recast of fiscal 2018 quarterly results in our financial tables within the press release to assist you with this reporting change. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $218.5 million of cash and $1.3 billion in total debt. Free cash flow for the quarter increased to $75.8 million, mainly due to improvements in working capital and the timing of capital spending and the increase in net income. During the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $27.7 million, while depreciation and amortization was $46.9 million. And finally, our Board of Directors approved an increase of $0.03 in the quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share. This increase aligns with our capital allocation priorities of growing our dividend in line with our earnings. This marks the 13th consecutive year of an increase in our dividend. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As you heard from Michael, we had a solid start to our new fiscal year and are quite pleased with our first quarter results. In total, we grew revenue just over 5% on a constant currency organic basis, with solid growth in each of our business units. Similar to last year, our AST segment led the way with 9% constant currency organic revenue growth, stemming from increased demand from our medical device customers. While the underlying growth of the business is expected to remain steady, our year-over-year revenue comparisons will be impacted for the rest of this fiscal year, as we have exited our contract with Sterilmed as of August 1. The reduction in revenue from this contract is about $14 million for the balance of the fiscal year. We anticipated this exit in our plans, so there is no impact to our revenue outlook due to this change. Also, this was basically a breakeven business for us, so there is minimal impact on earnings. Healthcare Specialty Services constant currency organic revenue grew 6% during the first quarter versus difficult comparisons in the prior year. As we discussed at the beginning of our fiscal year, we are working on several new opportunities for outsourced reprocessing in the U.S., none of which are generating significant revenue at this time. In addition, we talked about the substantial startup cost investments that we will incur as we move forward with these opportunities. Those investments are reflected in the segment's lower operating income year over year, as we anticipated. Healthcare Products constant currency organic revenue grew 4% for the quarter, with 5% growth in service and 2% growth in capital equipment. While shipments for healthcare capital equipment were a bit lighter than we planned, our backlog at quarter end was higher than anticipated and increased over $40 million from the same time last year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in healthcare capital equipment for the year and believe that underlying fundamentals remain stable. Healthcare Consumables revenue year-over-year comparisons continue to be impacted by last year's divestitures, but the organic revenue growth remains mid-single digits. From a profit perspective, we were impacted in the quarter by our planned increase in R&D spending, the negative impact of divestitures, and unfavorable currency movements year over year. Finally, Life Sciences constant currency organic revenue grew 3% in the quarter, with growth across the business. The overall growth rate was limited by the timing of capital equipment shipments, which we expect to occur over the coming quarters. Profit improved very nicely, as we benefited from increased volume and favorable mix, and in particular, mix within the capital equipment shipments. Putting it all together, even with the planned investments we have made in our businesses, we were able to grow adjusted earnings per share 18% year over year to $1.00 per share in our first quarter. With this solid start to the year, our outlook for the full year is largely unchanged. The only significant update is our expectations for currency. At the start of the fiscal year, we anticipated approximately $30 million in revenue benefit from currency movement. Based on the nine-month forward rates at the end of June, the year-over-year revenue impact is now expected to be only about $5 million favorable, a $25 million decline in as-reported revenue versus our original expectations. Despite this significant change in reported revenue, we continue to expect about $5 million positive impact of currency on reported EBIT for the year, as our costs will also be reduced if forward rates hold as of the end of June. And finally, our current assessment of tariffs also suggests about $1 million of annual negative cost impact, primarily in steel and electronic components. I would add that electronic components supply chain lead times are becoming more difficult, but at this time, we don't anticipate any significant shipment delays. All in, we continue to expect 4% to 5% revenue growth on an as-reported and constant currency organic basis, which we expect to leverage to deliver adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.63 to $4.75. Before we open to Q&A, I also want to discuss a recent management change. As disclosed in our 8-K filing earlier this week, I recommended and the board appointed Dan Carestio to the position of Chief Operating Officer. Dan has been with STERIS for over two decades, starting as a product manager in our Life Science business in 1997. Since then, he has held roles of escalating responsibility, including running the AST and Life Science segments. His teams are responsible for the remarkable turnaround in Life Science the past 10 years and the improvement of the STERIS AST business. He was also a primary player in the successful purchase of and then led the integration and management of the Synergy Health AST business. Early this year, Dan assumed responsibilities for STERIS's infection prevention products in our Healthcare segment in anticipation of Sudhir Pahwa's impending retirement. Since IPT and Life Science share technologies, manufacturing plants, and R&D resources, Dan has worked hand in hand with that part of our Healthcare business for years. As COO, Dan will now have responsibility for all our business segments, including manufacturing, marketing, R&D, sales, and service. That being said, Dan's elevation to COO in no way suggests that I'm planning on leaving STERIS soon or that the board has chosen a successor for my position. I intend to continue to be actively involved in running the business and do not have a definitive timeline for retirement. I look forward to working even more closely with Dan and with the rest of our senior executive team over the coming years. I would be remiss if I did not point out the remarkable job Sudhir Pahwa has done leading the infection prevention team in our Healthcare Products segment. While he's now retired from his full-time general management responsibilities, he will remain an advisor to management on a part-time basis. We thank Sudhir for all he has done for STERIS, and particularly for leading our IPT business for the past 10 years. With that, I will turn the call over to Julie for Q&A.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Mike and Walt, for your comments. Jamie, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started on Q&A?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question, Walt, Mike, Julie.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Good morning, Matt.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, I just wanted to first get a little bit more clarification on the exit from the Sterilmed contract. What drove that? And then also, the $14 million headwind was included in the 4% to 5% organic growth guidance at the beginning of the year and it's not incremental?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Matt, you are correct. So when we did our 4% to 5% revenue as reported in constant currency organic revenue guidance, we assumed that we would exit this contract, so it is already included in that, so it is not an additional headwind.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then on...
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: In terms of the rationale, a lot has changed versus the original thinking of that contract, and so that's point one. Point two, Synergy did that. And part of their rationale was to help them enter the U.S. market, and so it was not a profitable situation. And so there's no reason for us to need to do a non-profitable situation to help entry into the U.S. market, so I think that at a high level explains it most carefully.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's fair. And on Healthcare Specialty Services, are there any updates to the ORC contracts? How are the launches progressing, and is quoting and interest still picking up?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: A three-part question there, I think, I'll try to get to them all in one time. As I mentioned, we're not at a point where there's any significant revenue coming from the ones – we do ORC work, but the ones we've talked about, newer ones, there's no significant revenue coming from those. That's the first point. We have said and continue to think that it will be the back half of the year when we start seeing revenue from those operations. I don't think we have any significant change in our views of timing or process, if you will. If anything, my experience is all projects like that tend to lag a little bit. We've tried to incorporate that in our forecasting, but if anything, they tend to lag what people's point estimates generally are. I guess the last thing I'd say is, we do continue to have customers discuss with us the idea of doing this, and I don't see any abatement of that conversation. I think I've hit everything you asked, but if not, I'm happy to take a follow-on.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Hey, Matt, I'd just like to add also. We have started to secure buildings. We actually have started to spend capital on some of those projects. And obviously, we've also started hiring people, which is one of the reasons you are seeing a year-over-year decline in the segment operating income for HSS. So we are moving forward.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. And then last, I'll squeeze one last one in. On the M&A pipeline, it's been a while since you've done anything particularly material. I know the timing is unpredictable. But have you walked away from deals recently, and what reasons have you looked at some stuff and said no, it's not for us?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: We see a lot of deals, and I would say the preponderance of the deals that get shown to us are not for us, just because they don't fit our strategy. But in terms of things where we think it would fit our strategy or may fit our strategy, then the question is price, and then there are two different issues. One, what is the timing of those things? Is the seller interested or not? And then the question is, what is the price that either the seller or, if it's an auction type situation, is the price more than we want to take a look at? And that has occurred the last several years. We don't win everything that we try to get. But we're reasonably successful. If it fits our strategy, we're reasonably successful at making it happen. The timing is the more difficult one. But at today's valuations, it does sometimes push the envelope in terms of whether or not it makes sense to us financially. So we've seen more things we think are a little pricey for us than we would like to do than let's say four years ago. And then secondly, we are seeing a pickup I would say in the pipeline. We're seeing more things than we saw six or nine months ago, I would say.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you, all, Mike, Julie.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes. Please go ahead with your question.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Yes, in the Healthcare Products segment, would you separate out the impact of divestitures on the operating income there and why divestitures would hurt profitability here?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: So, Jason, the divestures that we're talking about in Healthcare Products are affecting our Consumables business, which is why you're seeing as-reported revenue decline. But as Walt said, our organic revenue is growing mid-single digits. So that's about the issue there. Then from a profit standpoint, that business was much smaller. It actually incurred a little bit of a loss in the first quarter last year. So that is what's impacting also on the Healthcare Products operating income standpoint is we have a slight loss there from last year.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Wouldn't that make profitability higher this year then?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: A relative loss, not loss of profit last year. It was not a highly profitable business, but it did make money.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: It made money last year. It did make money this year, I guess is an easier way to say it.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: And the timing of that was – they happened to have a particularly good quarter in the first quarter of last year relative to their history. This was the HCS business we divested. It was not a particularly profitable business, but they had a good first quarter last year.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Okay, that makes sense. And then as far as just profitability overall in that segment, when might we expect that to turn positive?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: That segment is pretty profitable, but year over year as we see capital shipments pick up, we've got $40 million of increased backlog. As that ships, you will see profitability improve.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: And, Jason, we do have $2 million or over $2 million of R&D expenditures there that we signaled that we would continue to increase R&D spending in particular in that segment, and that is going to be a little bit lumpy over the year, but we definitely are still anticipating to see higher R&D expenses for the year.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Sorry, I meant to say growth in profitability.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: It's okay. I understand.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: I didn't mean to say profitable. And then as far as the Specialty Services segment, would you be able to quantify those investments in the U.S. to outsourced reprocessing, and how should we think about those going forward?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Jason, I would say that there's several million dollars in the quarter that we are seeing as an expense as we make the investments. If you recall, for the full year after you take in the revenue and all the expenses, we were going to be – what was the number, Julie, do you remember?
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: A $2 million to $3 million loss this year with investments of $10 million in total, including R&D and in the (20:32) space.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yeah, relative loss.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Relative loss.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Right. Reduction.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And then finally, just aside from the tariffs, I wondered if you can make a comment on what you're seeing in the way of raw material costs and if the pricing that you're getting is more than offsetting these costs.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yes, if you look in total, our raw material costs are up a bit. And it's the tariff-driven that we've already discussed plus a little bit on the petroleum side. The things that are related to petroleum are the two biggest factors that are driving it. And we have been able to get a little bit of price, and so that has helped it. But predominantly we have offset those cost increases with productivity increases in the plants, either through design or through labor productivity.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Thanks a lot.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thank you, just a couple for me. One is on just the COO appointment. First off, congrats to Dan, but it would be helpful, Walt, for a little more context as to why now. You've been around for a while and running the business with good success. Can you talk a little bit about how the division of responsibilities will play out and how that might translate into performance in the business?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: I don't think I'll comment on division of responsibilities per se other than Dan will have full line responsibility for those operations, so he will take a more active role. The fact of the matter is, he had line responsibility for half the business already, so this adds on the balance of the pieces of the Healthcare business that he did not have. But more as a magnitude, that's the principal division. In terms of improved performance, it does allow me to do some other things both inside the operations. It's not like I will leave the operation. As you know, I'm an operator, and so there are things that I am working on personally in that space and will continue to. And then on the other side, it does allow me more flexibility of M&A and doing some things internationally than I would have been able to do otherwise. But I wouldn't expect a major, some major significant change here as Dan is picking up more of that responsibility and I will be shifting some of my work to other areas. But generally speaking, he was doing half that as it is. And the guys who are running those businesses that are reporting to him all know what they're doing, and I wasn't managing them minute to minute anyway.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And just on the Life Science business, I appreciate your comments on the earlier part of the call. But if I look at the comps, this was your easiest comp of the year, and it seems like the end markets for that business are actually pretty healthy. So can you help us think through some of the moving parts that you have baked into the assumptions for the rest of the fiscal year and what that means for growth for the total year at this point?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: You're correct in all the question. We don't see anything significantly changing in Life Science. And so the capital shipments clearly is a matter of timing, and that tends to be lumpy. But we also see variations in timing on the consumable side and we think we've seen just a little variation in timing. We don't see a significant change in our go-forward look. The pipeline, if you will, looks consistent. So it's just one of those – the quarter was a little slower than we might have expected, but we don't expect that to carry on into the future.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you, guys.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: On the capital side, we don't – I mean no is a big word, but we have so many shipments scheduled that we are highly, highly confident that that one will reverse its situation.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Hsu from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Maybe I could start on SG&A. It looks like spending came in a little bit higher than we had expected for the quarter, and I did get that there was a reclassification from non-op. but outside of that, was there any timing or pull forward on spending in the quarter?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: No, John, not really. The biggest issue we talked about in total was the R&D piece in spending, and that does hit, if you will, SG&A unless you break it out separately. But no, nothing out of the ordinary that we would say has caused us any difference in what our views have been or would have been.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for that, Mike. And then on AST, it looks like margins actually, even with the reclassification, hit a record high. So with the 40% operating margin in the quarter, I guess with expansion projects still slated to come on throughout the year, how sustainable is that?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: First of all, as I've mentioned before, it used to be if we did an expansion, that highly affected the profitability, particularly if it was a significant expansion of the unit, but that's when we had eight plants and expanded one. So it's 16% or 12% I guess of the business. Now we have 60 plants. So when we expand one or two or three, it does not have that kind of material impact, so that's point one. We have expansion, we will continue to have expansion we think for a long time, so that is built into the process. There may be some variation if we're building a particularly expensive plant. But other than that, we see that as normal. I will also remind you that there's a lot of capital on those plants, so it does have to make very nice margins to have good ROICs. But having said that, these are nice margins, and we have no reason to believe that they're not sustainable.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. And then the last one, backlog, you mentioned earlier that there was a pretty strong uptick on the Healthcare Products side. But, Walt, maybe you can give us just some color on the complexion of the backlog and where things stand right now as far as replacement versus project-based.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: We haven't seen a significant change in replacement versus project. It is strictly a matter of when orders come in, when customers want the deliveries, and when our factories can deliver them. So you put those three things together, that creates the differential between order rate and shipment rate, which is backlog. And it just so happens we've had a pretty strong set of orders the last two or three months, some of which were the customer doesn't want them for four or five months and some of which our plants are running pretty heavy. So we cannot add a whole lot more shipments at any given time. So it's a combination of those, but it's purely a timing question. But it's clear the order rate has picked up the last six months or so.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you for taking my questions.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: You bet, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal from Sidoti. Please go ahead with your question.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Yes. Hi, good morning. Walt, I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color in terms of the increased R&D spending on the healthcare product side in terms of some things you think you probably need to offer as you look ahead in terms of growth opportunities.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: As you know, our number one priority in spending money once we pay our dividend is to invest or reinvest in the businesses that we currently operate in. There's no question that is the highest returning process as long as we have a good place to put it. And so we have ramped up R&D the last several years. Some of that is a function of the mix of the products and businesses we have. Operating room integration, which is the fastest growing area in the surgical space over the last couple years, is a high R&D spender. It looks more like computers than it does patient room equipment, if you will, or something like that. So it is a higher R&D spend, so that has increased it. But we also have seen some opportunities we think for new products in the space, and so we've ratcheted up our R&D spend. And one of the things we've done is, just like we believe in insourcing of manufacturing, the more we can insource our R&D work and/or to invent things instead of buying things that other people have invented, the better our returns are. So we've continued to add to that muscle in the business, and I don't see that stopping.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, thanks. That's great. And also on the investment theme, you talked about focusing somewhat on outsourced reprocessing on the HSS business. And I was just wondering the timeframe in terms of investments there and when you expect to maybe start getting some returns on those.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: I would say there are two groups of investments in that regard. We do, I'll call it small project outsource work, and those returns are very rapid. You have to invest up front, like all services, and hire people, train people, do all those things, but they start returning pretty nice margins in three to six months, so it's a relatively short turnaround. Now, when you talk about building a new ORC and staffing it and staffing management and all that, that's a longer-term return. As we've mentioned, those businesses will start out the first several months losing money, and then they'll turn into breakeven and then relatively low profitability. Over a couple years, we will get to what we would call steady-state margins for that particular facility. So those are longer-term returning investments. We have a mix of both in that business, so you'll see a spread between those. And then the second piece, not unlike AST, once you have a facility in place and if you gather more customers for that facility, you might have to make some incremental investment in equipment or something and a few more people, but you don't have the all-in fixed costs that you do there. So as you fill those out, you also increase the profitability of the centers. But because we're in a startup mode, not unlike what we were 15 – 20 years ago on AST, we will see lumpiness in those returns as we add new facilities.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, that's great, and finally, Mike, just a quick question on the share repurchase. It seems like it ticked up a little this past quarter. I was just wondering how much you have available on the share buyback.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Mitra, we still have about $125 million remaining under the board authorization.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, thanks again for taking the questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, just a quick follow-up for me on the AST side. I know you were asked about the sustainability, but I'd love to get any color on the double-digit growth area that you're in. And then as a follow-up on the profitability, that 40% that was mentioned, could you just comment on pricing there? Can you get pricing there? Are you able to raise prices there, and then anything that's changing on the input cost side? Thanks.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Several questions. Clearly, our medical device business across the board had a nice last three months. And so we live off their work, so as we see more procedures and more devices being implanted and used, the better off we are, and clearly we reflect that. Secondly on price, we do get modest pricing improvements; that is, typically our contracts in that space are three to five years. Probably now between 80% and 90% of our business is on contract, and so that is built in. But again there are, I'll call them for lack of better terms, inflationary type cost increases or price increases. So we do get some price increase there. In terms of the input costs, no question, we are seeing pressure on labor costs, and labor is a big piece of that business. So labor costs around the world, as you know, are increasing, particularly in the U.S., and so we do see that pressure. But on the other hand, we're working on productivity. So we try to offset as much as we can in terms of labor cost components with productivity. Those are probably the biggest components that I would mention. I'm trying to think if I've hit all of your questions.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Sorry it was so many, but yes, you got them all. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, everyone, or I should say good morning, everyone. I appreciate you taking the question, just maybe one quick one at this point in the call from me. Walt, would you mind giving us a broad overview or state of the union when you think about the competitive dynamics in the industry? I know there's been a lot of chatter recently about asset sales that are pending, new entrants on the sterilization side from a contract perspective, as well as maybe migration to disposable scopes, just a number of moving parts I know you've addressed on a one-off basis, but maybe just some early, if you could, address just the competitive backdrop in the industry. Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Sure, Chris, good to chat with you again. First of all, in terms of, I'll call it the general industry backdrop and not necessarily competitive, I'll come back to that one, I think many times people look at healthcare and all of the changes that do occur and more importantly all the changes that are discussed, all the potential changes that are discussed, and we forget this little detail that healthcare is still built on the concept of first do no harm. So it is appropriately a highly regulated careful industry in general. So even though relative to healthcare there are rapid changes relative to many other pieces of the economy, they're pretty small changes. So I have found in my own experience in the last 30 years or so dealing in this space that we move more like a battleship then we do a PT boat as a group. And there are changes. The changes tend to occur when governments change things, significant reimbursement changes or significant approaches to things. But even then, things still tend to turn relatively slowly. That's point one. Secondly, from a competitive space, there have been a number of changes. There are businesses being purchased and businesses being bought and different players in the space. But generally speaking, we work in a highly competitive environment in medical devices. The R&D and barriers to entry are very different than they are in the pharma space, for example. And so being in a very competitive environment all the time and having price pressure from our customers all the time, particularly if you are not in the physician preference space, which we generally aren't, that has been the way of life for this business for 35 – 40 years, not 35 minutes. And so I don't see a radical change there. We clearly have seen more consolidation in the space that is. And as you know, the larger companies in healthcare have typically – and med device now I'm talking about, healthcare in general too I guess, the larger companies have tended to consolidate. But that is a continuation of a long-term trend, that's not something that's brand new. We often see both vertical and horizontal consolidation in the business. Sometimes it continues and sometimes it stops and reverses. Again, there will be a lot of change. But in terms of our space and our competitive space, I don't see those radically or having radically changed the past. But now at a high level – that's the high-level thing you asked for. It's very different business unit by business unit by business unit and it's different between AST and healthcare in general. There are fundamental differences between those businesses. But the things we've talked about or I've talked about here are characteristic across the board on all those businesses, in my view.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks much.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, at this time I'm showing no additional questions. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you as we get on the road this fall.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference call has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2018-05-09 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Julie Winter - STERIS Plc Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc
Analysts: David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the STERIS Plc Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Julie Winter, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Austin, and good morning, everyone. As usual on today's call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I do have just a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. Additional information regarding these measures, including definition, is available on today's release, including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 5.2%, driven by volume and 30 basis points of price. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter increased 70 basis points to 42%. Gross margin was impacted favorably by product mix and price, along with a 60 basis point improvement from divestitures. Currency had an unfavorable impact on gross margin of 60 basis points. EBIT margin at 20.5% of revenue for the quarter represents a 20 basis point improvement. EBIT margin expansion was limited somewhat by a 12% increase in R&D spending, a hiring ramp in our North American IMS business and higher corporate costs which are partially attributable to a higher bonus attainment percentage year-over-year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%, somewhat lower than we had anticipated due to favorable discrete item adjustments mostly relating to U.S. tax reform. Net income in the quarter grew 12% to $105.8 million or $1.24 per diluted share, benefiting from organic revenue growth and the lower effective tax rate. Segment growth has been detailed in the press release in both the tables and the copy. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended March with just over $200 million of cash, $1.3 billion in total debt and a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of just under 2.1 times. As we forecasted last quarter, we took the opportunity to repatriate approximately $83 million of cash during the fourth quarter, primarily from Canada and the UK, which was used to pay down debt. Free cash flow for the year was $294.3 million, a 15% improvement year-over-year, mainly due to higher net income and lower requirements to fund operating assets and liabilities. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $51.9 million, which was the highest we had in any quarter this year, while depreciation and amortization was $44.5 million. With that, I would now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to review another record year with you today. Our results for the full fiscal year were in line with the high end of our expectations as constant currency organic revenue grew 5%, while adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 10% to $4.15. As reported revenue growth was better than we expected, even though it was about flat as organic revenue growth, and approximately $20 million of favorable currency offset the impact of the divested businesses from last year. At the segment level, our full year results largely mirror the first nine months, so I will be brief in my remaining remarks about the year. The majority of our business grew at or above our expectations on a constant currency organic revenue basis. The two fastest-growing segments, HSS and Life Sciences, both exceeded our expectations for the year as each grew revenue 9%. The trends driving these two businesses are anticipated to carry into our new fiscal year, although year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult on top of this past year success. AST continues to deliver strong results with 7% constant currency organic revenue growth for the year. Remember, this includes about a 1% reduction in our growth rate due to the Sterilmed contract moving into the segment. AST profitability actually improved faster than we anticipated in fiscal 2018, reflecting the better-than-expected use of our capacity, including that which came online during this past fiscal year. While we continue to expect improvements in profit in FY 2019, the year-over-year change is now expected to be more modest than we thought originally due to the earlier-than-anticipated success in FY 2018. With regard to Healthcare Products, we continue to experience solid organic growth in recurring revenues. I remind you of the divestiture of Synergy UK Consumables business in Q3, which will impact our comparisons in November of this fiscal year. Total segment revenue grew 2% on a constant currency organic basis, driven by meaningful growth in both consumables and service, which was offset by a modest decline in capital equipment shipments. As I mentioned last quarter, we've launched about 30 new products in our Healthcare Products segment this past year, many of which are consumables. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we expect to continue at similar pace of product introductions, but we'll shift a bit more to capital equipment. Just one example, we've recently launched our newest hydrogen peroxide sterilizer, V-PRO maX 2, which offers a fast 16-minute cycle time for non-lumen devices in addition to other new features. With new products, a solid year in backlog and continued expectations for a stable hospital capital equipment spending environment, we anticipate capital equipment revenue growth returning to more normal low- to mid-single-digit growth in fiscal 2019. Shifting to our balance sheet, we committed to reducing debt back to our historic levels after the completion of the Synergy combinations some two and a half years ago. We accomplished that goal in fiscal 2018. From a capital allocation perspective, we will revert to our normal long-term priorities. Our first priority is dividend growth in line with growth of earnings. Our second is investment in our current businesses for organic growth in revenue and profitability. For fiscal 2019, we will be making substantial investments in our HSS segment to grow our outsourced reprocessing business in the U.S. We have several projects in the pipeline for these services and are planning to invest not only capital to build out the facilities, but also substantial hiring during the year to run them. We remain optimistic that this business model will succeed in the U.S. over the longer term. In addition, we will continue to invest in AST expansions around the globe to meet increasing demand. These two areas of investment alone will total more than $60 million in growth capital out of our total capital spending of approximately $190 million in fiscal 2019. Our third priority is acquisitions, which we continue to find available in the marketplace. We prefer tuck-ins to enhance our current businesses, but will also consider deals that would broaden our portfolio. We've not planned for any acquisitions in fiscal 2019, as the timing of deals is unreliable, as you know. We will modify our outlook during the year, if we complete material transactions. Lastly, our outlook contemplates share repurchases to continue at the level to offset dilution from our equity compensation programs. Turning to the specifics of our 2019 outlook, as you saw in the release, we expect total company revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 5% on both an as-reported and constant currency organic basis. Based on forward rates at the end of March, we would anticipate approximately $30 million in benefit from currency year-over-year, which will be offset almost entirely by the negative impact of divestitures. As I mentioned earlier, in addition to Northwell, we have several new projects in the pipeline for our outsourced reprocessing centers in the U.S. Our outlook includes approximately $10 million in revenue for Northwell and the new projects combined in FY 2019, which translates into approximately $50 million on a full year run rate basis in future years. However, with substantial startup costs this year, the revenue is not anticipated to drop through to earnings. In fact, we expect to lose $2 million to $3 million during fiscal 2019 for all these facilities combined due to the startup costs of the facilities. As we discussed last quarter, given the timing of our fiscal year, we had a partial benefit from U.S. tax reform in our full fiscal year 2018 of approximately 150 basis points and we expect another 150 or so basis points of additional improvement in fiscal 2019. As a result, the adjusted effective tax rate in our guidance is in the range of 21% to 22%. I will add, as I did last quarter, that there is still moving parts in the details of the new tax act, but we are comfortable in this range for fiscal year 2019. We will be making substantial investments in our business this year, which we think is prudent given the additional dollars available to us from the U.S. tax reform. We will be spending approximately $10 million on growing our HSS outsourced reprocessing business and increasing R&D spending in all four of our segments. Despite these investments, we anticipate operating profit to grow faster than revenue on a year-over-year basis, including about a $5 million benefit from currency. With share count about neutral, we anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.63 to $4.75 for fiscal 2019, which would be a 12% to 14% growth over fiscal 2018. For your model purposes, we anticipate that our quarterly distribution of earnings, which has been quite consistent in the past three years, will be similar to fiscal 2018. Reflecting the growth in earnings and reduced spending on acquisition and integration-related charges, free cash flow is anticipated to be approximately $340 million in FY 2019. Of course, this will change if we're successful on the acquisition front. We're excited to start our new fiscal year with solid momentum, new products and services and the team to create record years in fiscal 2019 and beyond. In that regard, I would like to say a few words about the changes to our board of directors also announced this morning. Jack Wareham, who has served on our board since 2000, and as Chairman since 2005, has announced that he will retire when his current term expires at our Annual General Meeting this summer. Jack has played a vital role in shaping our board and our company the past two decades. I didn't work with Jack before coming to STERIS, but knew him from our Industry Association, AdvaMed. The fact he Chairman when I was recruited to STERIS a decade ago made my decision to come very simple. I speak on behalf of the entire board when I say that we were very, very fortunate to have his leadership as Chairman for over decade and we certainly wish him and his wife well in their retirement. The board intends to appoint long-standing board member, Dr. Mohsen Sohi, to the role of Chairman after the Annual General Meeting. I'm extremely pleased that Mohsen has agreed to take on this responsibility. Lastly, we are also pleased to welcome a new board member, Dr. Nirav Shah, who we appointed as a member of the board last week. With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to open for Q&A.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Mike and Walt, for your comments. Austin, if you would give the instructions for Q&A, we can get started.
Operator: Absolutely. And our first question will come from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Hey, can you hear me?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yes, Dave.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: We hear you well, Dave.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning. I understand the spending, the investments, and thanks for all that detail. But I got to ask you a question I really never get to ask. So given your capital allocation priorities, why no increase in the dividend?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: We would argue, all things being equal, we haven't made that decision. We do look at it each and each board meeting, and we make decision in each board meeting. But note, we would expect to raise our dividends in line with earnings growth over time.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: And Dave, we have consecutively – 12 years of consecutive dividend growth. And obviously, as Walt said, we will be looking forward to possibly 13 year of consecutive dividend growth.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Good to hear. And it is noteworthy that you're one of the few that I cover that actually has that component. So I guess, as a follow-up, just looking at gross margin, specifically in the quarter and then as we're looking just kind of to the year ahead, we're a little below what we thought. And I'm curious in terms of your outlook for 2019, are you assuming some improvement in that kind of 42% range? Should we be looking for maybe some basis points of improvement as the year progresses? Any thoughts there? Thanks a lot.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Dave. This, this year we actually had some, especially in the quarter, was a little bit lower than we anticipated as we did have about 60 basis points of unfavorable FX impact in the gross margin, which got us down to 42%. And as we talked about, we did see nice improvement all year, and part of that was because of the divested businesses and we actually had that at 42.2%. And as we normally do, we strive to improve not only gross margin, but we also strive to improve the leverage we have in our business from an SG&A standpoint. So in total, our thought process continues to be that we will continue to expand EBIT margin as we have stated in the past in our normal 50 basis points to 75 basis points in that range going forward. So yeah, we would expect to continue the margin improvement.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Thank you.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Hsu with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, maybe we could start with the guidance. The top-line guidance you provided organic constant currency growth 4% to 5%. You performed nicely in fiscal 2018 coming in at the high end of that range. So with – I'm just trying to understand with $10 million in new projects baked in for the HSS segment, for outsourcing, and it sounds like some new products driving improvement in capital equipment, why is 4% to 5% still the right range for this year?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yeah, I think, a cat on a hot tin roof, once burdened, is a little cautious. And so, if you go back two years ago, we moved to 6% as the top end of our guidance range and we didn't perform at that level. So, I think we're going to watch this a little bit. And we're very pleased to be 5-ish this year. And of course, we'll strive to be 5-ish or as well as we can above that next year or this coming year, I should say. But at this point, we think 4% to 5% is probably a prudent place to sit.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then on HSS, it sounds like the projects that you have slated for this year at a full run rate will be around $50 million at some point. So, I guess, how fast can you get there and how do you think about the margin profile? You obviously are investing in that business. But kind of at a full run rate basis, the question is really, the timing that you can get there is – and how should we think about the margin profile?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yes. I mean, obviously, if we're getting $10 million this year and $50 million over the long term, it's a little bit of time before we get there. So, you should be thinking about months and years, not days and weeks in terms of that timing. That's the first point. The second point is, again, as we said, we will be losing money actually in that space this year in these new projects, not in total, but in these new projects, we'll be losing money this year. And that's normal for us when we're starting things up in any of the business where we have significant expenditures, AST or HSS type businesses. But we do expect to get to reasonable margins relatively soon and, in the long run, to nicer margins.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. And if I may, just...
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: The trick for both, us and you, in forecasting that is how many new ones come on as the other ones grow. You may remember if you go back in time, in AST, when we were much smaller in AST, every time we added a new plant, had an impact on the margin rate. Now that we have 60 plants, we can add four or five without hardly noticing, if you will, because some are maturing as others are coming in. We'll have some of that phenomenon, if you look only at the U.S. business, how you look at it on a global basis, it will even out, much like it does in AST.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks for that, Walt. And then just maybe the last one, your leverage ratio down nicely towards 2 times. Obviously, got your comments on the renewed focus for capital allocation priorities, but just related to M&A, how do we think about a size, maybe some timing? And then also maybe just if you could talk about the complexion of the pipeline, where you see opportunities by segment? Thank you.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Sure. I've given up on timing. So if you were to take any timing, you want to pick and you're likely to be as good as me. But if you step away from the timing question, we do have a pipeline of things that we're working on. I wouldn't characterize any of the segments as radically different in terms of their possibilities. And just when I think one has no possibility, something pops up in that segment. So, I don't feel radically different about any of the segments. It is clear, we now have a much broader portfolio and we're putting that portfolio together in different ways, and we have opportunities, if we will, sometimes between those segments. And so, that creates more opportunity. And we've also, as I mentioned, broadened our horizon a bit to look not just at tuck-ins, which we pretty much gone to inclusive tuck-ins post the Synergy deal, and moving more to thinking about extensions, if you will, as opposed to what I'll call clean tuck-ins.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. And if I could just maybe follow-up on that one quickly, Walt. How do we think about the complexion of what you're looking at just from a capital versus consumable and service perspective?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yes. We're 75%/25% recurring revenue, if you will, versus capital now. I don't know of any reason to suspect that we would be radically different in particularly the tuck-in side of the equation. If there's a newer opportunity, then it will depend on the nature of that business, obviously. And we do not have a gross bias for or against any of those segments. In my view, capital which does tend to have maybe a little bias in the marketplace, but capital is consumable, it just takes a little longer. And in some sense, there's more opportunity there because if you can reduce the life of the product, you actually have more opportunity; if you're a consumable, the life is one use pretty much. And so, we do not have a strong bias there. And the other thing I would add is our service business, which is a very nice recurring revenue business in both Life Sciences and Healthcare, is there because we have – in the large part, because we have this capital business. So if you don't have the capital, you can get to the consumable side of that as well. So, we don't have a strong bias.
John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Excellent. Thanks for all that color.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And thank you for taking the questions. Walt, I just want to start off with the 4% to 5% guidance and just generally understand kind of the moving pieces as far as the segment goes. With healthcare cap equipment recovering to a low- to mid-single-digit range, what is growing below the company average, that 4% to 5%, to keep it at that range? Because I think AST, Healthcare Specialty Services, Life Sciences, all are potentially growing at 5% plus the consumables businesses as well.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I mean the statement is correct. And if you take our capital business last year, which was slightly below flat, and move it into the higher range, the math, if you take last year's math, the math would suggest something higher, no question. Now, we did mention we had a couple of segments that were just on fire last year. And as much as we would like to believe that that fire will continue raging at the same speed, we are a little cautious about that reoccurring. And there is a couple of places where we know that there was a little – I'll call it, just a little more than normal growth. But generally speaking, I would put it on the side of caution of going over the top of that 5% level very much.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then can you talk a little bit more about the growth that you're seeing in Life Sciences, in particular? Like what's driving the equipment purchases? And also, whether or not you have consumables that are attached to that, and to the point where we'll start seeing some stronger consumable growth as that installed base increases?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Sure. On the capital side, it's really a twofold issue. There's what's going on in the market and what we're doing about it. The first is, we had a long period where there was very little capital equipment spend in the pharma business. And since the bulk of our business really is related to the pharma side, for that matter, a dearth of research too, which is a smaller component. And research is not dissimilar, but pharma has clearly increased our spending and we happened to be in the spaces where it's pretty attractive to do that. There was a lot of consolidation going on and people weren't adding plant capacity. They're now increasing capacity and/or replacing equipment, because of, for lack of better terms, pent-up demand from not having done that for a long time. So, we're seeing kind of a double positive going on there as it relates to the biologics and vaccine type businesses that we support. So, that's really the driver from the market side. And clearly, we've seen that in the marketplace, in general. In addition, our guys have done a really nice job in product development and, specifically, around the vaporized hydrogen peroxide space. And that has really played well for us as they are building that capacity, because a lot of the new space does require a VHP-type application. We've done a nice job on the other, the washing and the steam sterilization as well, but I would say, in general, that's the driver.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And on that V-PRO, that hydrogen peroxide space in Life Sciences, J&J is potentially divesting their advanced sterilization business, or their infection (27:12) prevention business, and that's where you compete with them. Are you seeing competition in Life Sciences on that V-PRO side or is that a market where you're alone and advancing that?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: We have never had the good fortune to be walking in the wilderness by ourselves in any of our product lines. So, we have good competitors in literally every space we work in. We do tend to be one of, if not the largest player in most of the spaces we work in; not all of them, but most of them. So yeah, there's plenty of competition. And you have to remember that pharmaceutical business is a global business, in general, and more for us than some of our other spaces. And so, there are multiple competitors around the globe, too.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then lastly on, if – I understand the investments that you're making in Healthcare Specialty Services, and I'm really excited to see some of the growth over the next couple of years. But what are – like, how should we be thinking about the long-term margin profile of that business over the next couple of years? And are we still looking at mid- to high-single digits or can you potentially get that over the long run into like low doubles? And then the new deals you're doing in that space, are they also JVs or structured differently?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I think if you look at mature components of the business, those mid-single digit or mid-double digits are appropriate numbers to consider at the business unit level. And so, that's really clear. So, I do think that is the case. However, in the short run, you have to work your way up to that, particularly in this HSS business or the outsourced reprocessing center business. It will take a little bit longer, because we have the capital infusion and the people infusion. And we do rely on getting productivity over the course of time to improve those margins as well. So, it will take a bit longer to get to maturity, and as I mentioned earlier. So, it really will depend on how quickly it grows. It's the kind of good news/bad news story. The faster it growth, the longer it will take us to see, quote-unquote, ultimate margins. But the flipside is, the greater the long-term potential is.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: And Matt, just to add to your question about the capital investment, the ones Walt is talking about and referring to, those would be 100% owned, operated, our capital going into that business, and then we would sell the service associated with that. So, no joint ventures at this point in time, other than obviously Northwell is a joint venture and Vmed (30:00) is a joint venture.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Mike.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: I'm sorry. I'll add one more thing that mid-teens margin is, obviously, not reflective of corporate allocation.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Julie.
Operator: And our next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks. Walt, just a question on the FY 2019 guidance. In that 4% to 5%, obviously, that's a relatively consistent growth rate with prior years. And at the same time, there are probably some dynamics in the underlying end markets that are evolving. And what I was most interested in was the nature of just where surgical volumes are taking place in the healthcare system. And the reason I ask is, if you look at what's going on with hospitals seeing slightly lower in-patient days, but yet the device companies are seeing pretty good growth. Help us think through where you're trying to find marginal growth. Is it the primary care centers or is it more tertiary? Just kind of curious where you're trying to access at/or above-market growth rates as you move through this fiscal year? Thanks.
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Sure. Great question. And particularly in capital, it's always a game of moving parts. I would say, first, in general, in-patient, everyone is working to reduce the length of stay or the patient days on the same amount of surgery. So, the procedure volume and patient day volume actually for the last 30 years hasn't matched up, because we have shrunken the number of patient rooms over the last 30 years by 20%, 25%, at the same time, we've grown procedures significantly. So, it is indeed clear that when hospitals report patient days, that's very different from when they report procedures. The second issue you raise is in terms of where those procedures are going. Clearly, we are seeing more and more of those procedures going into an outpatient setting, whether that be a hospital-based outpatient setting, or whether it be an ambulatory surgery center or other procedural center, like a GI center, that may or may not be on the hospital campus. And in very recent time, the last year, year and a half, we've clearly seen a significant expansion in that ambulatory setting. Again, it seems it go in cycles a bit. If you kind of look back over the last 20 to 30 years, there have been two or three cycles where ambulatory surgery centers grew very rapidly relative to hospital operating rooms, and that seems to kind of be going on right now. But in the long run, it tends to sort of work its way through as hospitals put their own "outpatient centers" either in the building or in another building where they can capture their customers. But we do see ambulatory growing relative to inpatient, if you will. And then what happens is you'll see a phenomena where you get two or three significant procedures, like when we start seeing heart, lung transplants, where even though it's only one procedure, that procedure takes six hours. That's very different from one that takes 30 minutes. And so, it's not just procedures, but volume of procedures and we watch those phenomenon.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow up on capital allocation, it's kind of tied to the prior question which is, you talked a little bit about wanting to both invest organically as well as through M&A. Could you help us frame some of the types of businesses where it would make sense to be adding to existing product lines versus getting into totally new categories, where you can either leverage your expertise or your channel to tap into a new vein of growth? I'm just kind of trying to balance going into something that's sort of directly adjacent versus kind of new product category all together?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yes. We don't get into that level of granularity, I'll call it. But I will say, all things being equal, we prefer to bring new products and services into businesses where we have channel and where we have expertise. So, that would dominate our thinking in each of the major segments and then moving, I'll call it, another half step out, as we do with US Endoscopy five years ago is, I'll call it, the secondary in our thinking. But clearly, we've done that a couple of times in a significant ways when we moved to the IMS business or HSS business, instrument repair business, that was clearly a next step adjacent move. We like the move because a big piece of that business is very much in the Central Sterile Department, where we're already strong. Even though we feel that it's best to have separate sales forces and separate service forces for that right now, it was still a customer set that we highly understood and had a great deal of presence in. So, that's the kind of thinking we will look at. Same with GI, obviously, we're in GI in the cleaning and care side of GI for the long time, 20, 30 years and we moved more into the specialty procedure products to assist the GI procedures. So, that would be the kind of thing we would be looking at.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead.
David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review: Good morning and thank you. Really quick, I was wondering if you could remind us of your input costs and especially given the backdrop of commodity volatility and how much of part (35:47) sales or your margins that is in and what you see it trending as going forward into the new year?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: On our manufactured product, which is I think the areas that you're really talking about here, 55% of our business now is service. So, a lot of the input variables aren't as, we want to call it, the inflation in those variables, it's all about labor more than materials. And so that, if you think about what labor costs or prices are likely to be doing in the next couple of years, you would have pretty good indication. On the product side of the business, there are significant inputs. And it's fairly typical, I would guess, of manufacturing type of it is in (36:38) 50% to 60% of our cost is raw material. And it depends on how much we're in-sourcing versus how much other people are making for us. And so, it varies by product line. And we are seeing a little pickup of inflation. We're seeing a little bit on the nickel and steel side. Obviously, the work going on right now, it's difficult to predict what is going to happen to steel prices the next a little bit, depending on how we handle trade. But we don't think that will be a significant number or barrier for us. So in general, we are seeing a little pick up, but it's not something that we're losing sleep over at this point in time.
David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review: Great. Thanks. And then, when you talked about your shifting in the Healthcare Products segment to more of a capital equipment with your new products, I was wondering if you could give a little color into what you're seeing on the demand side. Is that being meeting customers' needs or are you just coming out with new products to refresh old systems?
Walter M. Rosebrough, Jr. - STERIS Plc: Yeah. Our product development function does look at two components. The first is, are there things that our customers can use in current products we have. And the new V-PRO is a great example of that. It is hydrogen peroxide sterilization and they've had hydrogen peroxide sterilization for a while. But what we're giving them is a more rapid approach to sterilizing certain things. So instead of taking a half hour, it takes 15 minutes kind of thing. We're also giving them less aborts from some technology we put into the system, so they don't run half a cycle and waste the hydrogen peroxide and have to redo it, plus that they lose the time. So, the question is, is that – we view that as meeting customer demand and we think most of our products in the capital equipment side should have something like that happening with them in the five- to seven-year timeframe, because again if you want to reduce the average life of the product, you have to give people a reason to do something different, that's a true value to them. Then there's a flip side, where we have a product from nowhere, if you will, a new product to the universe. We have more of that in the US Endoscopy side of our business than other places, but we have a number of products that are those kind of products. But again, in terms of, I'll call it, percentage basis, we're probably 2% or 3% to 1% (39:22) to the product improvement side, type of new product to the kind of first-to-the-universe product.
David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review: Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. And we look forward to seeing many of you out on the road in the next few weeks.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-02-07 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Julie Winter - Director IR Walter Rosebrough - CEO Michael Tokich - SVP, CFO & Treasurer
Analysts: Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Larry Keusch - Raymond James Dave Turkaly - JMP Securities Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc David Stratton - Great Lakes Review Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the STERIS plc Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Julie Winter, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everybody. On today's call, as usual we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I also do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. Many of these important factors are outside of STERIS' control. No assurances can be provided as to any results or the timing of any outcome regarding matters described in this webcast or otherwise. The Company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the Company and on our website. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic growth, and free cash flow are all non-GAAP measures that may be used from time-to-time during this call and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental all financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision making. STERIS' adjusted earnings per diluted share and segment operating income exclude the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, acquisition-related transaction costs, integration costs related to acquisitions and certain other unusual or non-occurring items. To measure constant currency organic revenue, the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that affect the comparability and trends in revenue are removed. We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant equipment and intangibles. Additional information regarding adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow is available in today's release. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 5.2%, driven by volume and 110 basis points of price. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter increased 250 basis points to 42.6% of the improvement 170 basis points is due to the impact from the divested businesses with the remainder due to favorable product mix, price and productivity improvements somewhat offset by negative impact from currency. EBIT margin expanded 140 basis points to 20.8% of revenue for the quarter. We are very pleased with our continued ability to expand EBIT margin and leverage revenue growth in addition to the favorable impact from the divested businesses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.6% which added approximately $0.05 to earnings per diluted share. Included in the third quarter effective tax rate is the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December. The tax reforms primary change is a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a March fiscal year-end company, we benefit from a blended U.S. tax rate reduction from 35% to 31.5% in the current fiscal year because tax law changes must be accounted for in the period of enactments, we have recorded a benefit in our third quarter tax expense to account for the year-to-date affect of the blended tax rate which will not be repeated again in the fourth quarter. While our assessment of the effects of the tax reform is ongoing, we do expect the benefit we recorded in the third quarter to result in a tax rate of approximately 25% for the full fiscal year which is at the low end of our prior expectations. Net income in the quarter was $96.3 million or $1.12 per diluted share benefiting from organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion and the lower effective tax rate. Segment growth has been detailed in the press release in both the tables and the copy. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $284 million of cash, $1.42 billion in total debt and a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 2.25 times. Free cash flow for the first nine months was $216.4 million, a 19% improvement from the same period in fiscal 2017 mainly due to higher earnings and lower requirements to fund operating assets and liabilities year-over-year. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $38.1 million while depreciation and amortization was $44.7 million. We now anticipate that free cash flow will be about $300 million and capital spending will be approximately $160 million for the fiscal year. With the enactment of tax reform, we anticipate repatriating about $100 million of cash which will be used in alignment with our capital allocation priorities. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same maintaining and growing our dividend relative to our growth, investing in organic growth in our current businesses, targeting acquisitions in adjacent product and market areas, reducing our total company leverage, and finally share repurchases if the other uses of cash are lower than our desires and do not offset dilution. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks Mark, and good morning everyone. We are now three quarters of the way through our year and have delivered constant currency organic revenue growth at the high-end of our expectations growing 5% year-to-date and are on track for another year of record earnings. Looking across our portfolio, we have high single-digit or low double-digit revenue growth across the majority of our businesses driven by solid underlying market trends and new product and service offerings. In particular, our healthcare specialty service segment has outperformed our expectations across the board growing constant currency organic revenues 10% year-to-date. Life Sciences whose capital equipment business has now had two strong quarters in a row with continued strong backlog grew constant currency organic revenue 8% in the first nine months of the year. Our AST business continues to experience increased volume from our core medical device customers. In addition, I'm pleased to report that our facility in Puerto Rico which is now back to normal production and has been since December much faster than we anticipated. We originally thought that the hurricane in Puerto Rico could impact profit in our AST segment by as much as $3 million this year. Based on where we stand today, we now expect the impact to be just $1 million, all of which was incurred in the third quarter. In addition, we have recently launched our sustainable EO sterilization service offerings, which will assist customers in developing strategies to reduce the amount of ethylene oxide used during sterilization, at the same time achieving prescribed sterility assurance levels, that is good for our customers and good for the environment. Within healthcare products, we have a solid growth in organic revenue fueled in part by many new launches including our newest 20 minute biological indicators for low-temperature sterilization named Celerity. This growth in recurring revenue has been a strong factor in our growth in healthcare for the last couple of years. Celerity is but one of about 30 new products we're releasing in our healthcare products segment this year. Healthcare capital equipment has had somewhat lighter revenue than anticipated, with shipments down year-over-year, but that is offset by a nice pickup in backlog on both a sequential and year-over-year basis and a pipeline of potential future business that is solid. As you know, capital equipment businesses can be lumpy and we had strong shipments last year, especially in our fourth quarter. So we're optically concerned with healthcare capital. Moving on to the impact of tax reform in the U.S. Mike has already discussed the specific impact to STERIS in the third quarter and our expected outcome for fiscal 2018. But we will wait until our fourth quarter call to provide more specific details. Our best estimate as of now is that STERIS will have an adjusted effective tax rate in the low 20 percentiles in fiscal 2019, down from the mid-20s this year. Let me be clear there are many complicated aspects of the new tax law and we and our advisors will continue to evaluate the impact of those tax provisions on STERIS and naturally, we'll be working to legally minimize our taxes. As is the case with many companies, the U.S. corporate tax reform results in significant additional earnings for STERIS to use to strategically grow our business and return value to our customers, our people and our shareholders. This will make us more competitive with our global competitors, many of whom manufacture outside of America. One of our first decisions on that front that we announced in our press release this morning, is that we will be paying a one-time special bonus to all U.S. employees other than senior executives. The total bonus payout is expected to be about $7 million, which we plan to exclude from our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings. This is just one example of our continuing investments in our people who are the foundation of our success. Turning to our revised outlook for 2018, we are maintaining our outlook for 4% to 5% constant currency organic revenue growth for the full fiscal year. I would remind you that our fourth quarter last year was extraordinary, so we do have particularly difficult comparisons in Q4. Reflecting our expected operating performance at the high-end of our previous guidance, plus the benefit of the lower effective tax rate, we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.16, which is either 9% or 11% growth from prior year levels. We are very pleased with our overall performance so far this year and are on track for another solid year of growth and record performance and look forward to many more. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of STERIS. I will now turn the call back to Julie for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Walt for your comments. Jamie, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started on Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Isaac Ro: Couple for me. First off on the med device customer demand and we look across the industry this quarter, obviously pretty solid results for other companies, but seems like your business was a little bit better than otherwise would have been expected. Anything you can point to that might be one-time in nature or customer-specific that help drive the strength in that business?
Walter Rosebrough: No, not really. Again we do seem to be picking up a specifically the STE business where med device in general would drive that. We do seem to be picking up steam a little bit again I suspect we may be picking up a little share in that space.
Isaac Ro: And then maybe a follow up on the expense side obviously on the tax benefit here and you mentioned the one-time bonus payment to employees. Are there other elements to the tax reform that are going to lead you to reinvest more aggressively on longer-term projects innovation related things just kind of curious what else you're doing with the windfall here to try and fuel future growth for the business? Thank you.
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. We have been long-term in-sourcer, onshorer people may be before it was popular again for the last 10 years basically. And so that something is clearly a part of what we expect to do. We do like to make things, we like to design things, we like to make things, we like to sell things. So all of those things are a natural element of what we do as a result we've grown employment and we’ve been able to bring more money to the bottom line. But the Tax Act clearly incents us to do more of that. And so all things being equal there're projects - that if they were at the margin maybe not as attractive as we might have like they maybe more attractive. So clearly capital spending in the short run is more attractive than it was two years ago, and almost any I’ll it investment that gives a reasonable return in the U.S. is more attractive than it was a year ago. So, all things being equal we would expect to see some more investment in that space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Larry Keusch: Just a couple of quick questions, maybe starting with AST. So that growth was obviously nice 2.5% on an organic basis. I guess Walt you indicated a disruption from the hurricane was less than anticipated. Is there anything else to read into that growth rate, I recognized the comp was a bit easier but was there any sort of perhaps on Puerto Rico, companies that were moving more aggressively to get volume through the facility given that they were coming up at speed as well?
Michael Tokich: I don't think so - you are correct you remember last year third quarter kind of all of our consumable or recurring businesses just had a slump around Christmas and at the time we really didn't understand it and to be honest we still don't really understand it. Our suspicion is it was just the way the holidays fell and people were taking off more time than normal and that seems to have come to fruition because we didn't see that in the third quarter. So that on a quarter-over-quarter that's clearly the case across the board for all of our consumables, but when you look at it for the year, we’re still having a wonderful consumable year across the board recurring revenue actually across the board. And I don't think there's any overwhelming change in the Puerto Rico issue that is, yes there were things that were not done and yes there is a little bit of catch up, but it turned out - it turns out that they were not down as long as any of us thought that is our customers were not. We got up in about a week and a half and we’re able to start processing and then they really have done a nice job and you have to give credit to the Puerto Rican people they have just because they’re still living in pretty tough conditions, but across the board for what they're doing in all the medical device companies. And then those the feed us of course in our plant as well, we’re just ecstatic at the work they are doing.
Larry Keusch: And then just two other quick ones. Just on HSS again really nice nearly 9% constant currency organic growth there, but the margin was down sequentially I believe 5.6% in the third quarter from 8ish in the 2Q. So again anything that that sort of changed during the mix there to be thinking about and maybe what's the right way to think about directionally where you think that margin can go over time?
Michael Tokich: We spoke a year ago this time, we're having a very different conversation as you remember. Year ago at this time, we said we over invested in way in front of revenue that -- or just in front of revenue we expected and then not only did we not get what was expected, we lost on it. So that really hurt you in a service business. In this case, we've held back just to make sure we once burned. You want to be a little more sure and now they’ve begun to reinvest for future growth, but we will be far more careful I'm sure and don't expect a significant reduction as we saw in the past. So you will see some variations quarter-to-quarter, but if you look at it longer-term, we don't expect or we do expect to be where we said we were going to okay.
Larry Keusch: And then last one, I know you're not you providing 2019 guidance at this point and thank you for the color on the tax rate. Just two things come to mind. Number one, is there anything that you can say as it relates to Northwell and timing there? And then also obviously there was a meaningful portion of the margin expansion this year was due to the divestiture of the assets. So it is it fair again to think about your typical 50 to 100 hundred basis point underlying margin expansion targets is the right way to think as we move forward past this period of the divestures.
Walter Rosebrough: So two questions I think in there and I'll try to hit them both. Northwell no real further comment than what we've already said as you know than has been reported not us but by others that the building is essentially done and we have said that we are spending capital in that space now. So we fully expect to start up next year sometime and yeah we're giving no more guidance on that now, but we will in the future. So at a high level that's that conversation. We also have seen again continued interest in other places to do similar type things. It will not affect next year in any significant way other than potential capital spending, but we have some things that are looking more like fire and smoke now. So we are seeing some early signs that that may come to fruition more than the past year, year and half. The last topic you raised was margin and generally speaking, I think you're on track. The bulk of the divestiture movement has occurred and so if you look year-over-year goes, quote, unquote, “our normal cost reductions” I will caution as always, we are in our planning cycles. We're thinking through what our strategic investments are going to be. And as you know, we don't always drop every dollar that we find into the bottom line. We invested for the future and we invested in our customers. And to us tax is just one cost. So there are a number of costs that we will be working down next year and some of which is the tax rate and we want to make judicious decisions about what to do with those things.
Julie Winter: Just to be clear, when we say, next year, we mean…
Walter Rosebrough: Next fiscal year is always the next year for us, exactly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Turkaly: I guess we see some of the benefit of so your balanced or diversified business today, but Walt, just to make sure and check the box and hear your thought on the healthcare capital side again, any other color, I know it's the second quarter where and I know it can be lumpy, but any color on major product, products or projects and replacement capital, anything that you could give us just to clarify what you're seeing out there today?
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. At a high level again, I would not characterize and now I am talking more about the pipeline, which I think is your question the hospital spending pipeline if you will. I wouldn't characterize it significantly different in North America than we have been characterizing it in the past. So we still see a solid pipeline in the future projects that we're seeing for the potential future for real projects that we expect to occur in the future still looks very similar that we've been talking about. It's solid to maybe slightly up. So that always makes us feel good, particularly given the level of uncertainty that's going on in healthcare reimbursement issues in the United States. In the rest of the world, actually the pipeline I would characterize and I think I did last time that the rest of the world seems to be picking up a little bit and particularly in certain areas. Europe has stayed strong for us, Middle East was pretty much a disaster for the last 18 months, but it is now picking up. So we look at EMEA as one unit that we see I think more strength there than we have seen in the past. Asia-Pacific was very strong last couple of years, it kind of flattened out this year but I think we see a better future there in terms of pipeline. And Latin America which has been really tough for us has seem to have bottomed out. So we have a bottom and maybe a little bit of pipeline there then we have in the past. So the rest of the world is actually looking stronger. I will add we talked about currency and the effects of currency a lot in terms of what hits the revenue, what it's a bottom line but that's I’ll call the accounting version of currency. When we have - when the dollar strengthens to other currencies it is a headwind for STERIS because we tend to build the North American most of those costs are U.S. based costs and so U.S. dollar based. Most of our competitors are not building in the U.S. and as a result most of their costs are other than dollar base, so when the dollar strengthens we have headwind selling both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. When the dollar weakens, we have a tailwind. So up until the last couple of months we've been pretty much running into headwinds the last couple of months things are changing. Now I do not try to forecast currency but because if I could that, I wouldn’t be working here, but in any event we do see some relief of the headwinds that we've been facing in terms of our currency for the last couple of months.
Dave Turkaly: And then I guess just two quick follow up on the AST obviously. People have talked about how strong it was. As you look at that close to 10%, high single-digit growth may be gaining some share. Can you sustain a growth rate like that I mean my recollection was that some of these - your facilities run pretty hot and that there wouldn’t be maybe capacity for you to sustain sort of increases like that without sort of expanding. So just love to get your thoughts there on what that could look like even as we’re looking ahead to next fiscal year? Thanks.
Walter Rosebrough: No question, if you have 60 points roughly and if you wrote 10% a year roughly that means you have built six points a year roughly. Now a plant is not a plant, the U.S. plants tend to be more concentrated as a result, tend to be larger probably close to 2X larger and so that's one set of facts - it is very different to have to build a brand new Greenfield plant, as opposed to adding a couple of units inside a plant or adding on to a plant where we already have the ground, and we have a number of expansions which is what do our big piece of our capital spending. A number of expansions going on as we speak I think as many as 7 or 8 I done that off the top of my head but that type of expansion levels across the world. And we are in fact investing across the world in those expansions. And so we think that the growth is there and we will be able to meet it, it used to be if we go back in time the Isomedix days 10 years ago when we did eight plant expansion it was a big deal it caused profitability to fall pretty significantly because new plant takes a while to get filled and then make that money. We've worked hard to get that more on a routine basis. So we’re always expanding and I suspect we’ll always be expanding as long as medical devices keep growing which we don't see any end to that frankly. And so it's much less of a pain now when we - to the bottom line finance of the whole company STERIS in total and certainly AST when we’re doing that. So there are expansion dollars if you will reduction of profitability already in our current operations and we’ll always be as far I’m concerned.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan: Walt most of your businesses are growing high single digits or low double-digits now I mean you had a really incredible quarter in almost everything with the exception of healthcare capital equipment. Could you give us a little bit of color on maybe the surgical side versus the infection prevention side - you said you not worried about it. Like why should we not be worried about it?
Walter Rosebrough: Well first of all, I'll break it in two questions, why we're not worried about it is if you look longer across the Board, it hasn't grown that fast but nor has capital spending grown that fast. So from a long-term perspective, we're not that concerned about it. At any given time in each of the units, we have product families or products that are doing really well and product families that are not doing as well and that's -- we have that currently. So for example, if you look the last couple years our ORI business has just been on fire. It was exactly stronger last year than this year on a growth rate issue and that just happened. A couple of big projects can change that very quickly. The same is true with our what we call the MS or equipment management systems. They're very strong growth last year, less strong this year. So it's a mix-and-match of products across the area. In the IPT business, washing has been particularly strong lately and steams the relation less strong lately. Hydrogen peroxide was extremely strong a couple of years ago, now it's just strong. So it mixes and matches and when we look across the Board and what we're doing, what we have done and what we are doing, we believe we're in a good position in our capital equipment businesses. And again, I mentioned the headwinds of a strong dollar and that's receding a bit right now and that's obviously positive for us in terms of relative particularly outside America, but even inside America since most of our competitors manufacture outside America, it changes the headwind, tailwind equation.
Matthew Mishan: And then you mentioned 30 new products in that area. How much on average, what number of products do you tend to release in that area in any given year? Is there any difference in level of importance of a couple of them versus previous couple years?
Walter Rosebrough: Absolutely, there are significant differences of levels of importance and we have continued to pick up product launches in the healthcare products group in total and so we have continued to grow I guess just I would say 30 is a big number. But on the other hand we're not I wouldn't suspect the number is going to be a whole lot less next year either. So we have picked up our product development. We have a broader product line today. So each of those product lines needs to be refreshed on a routine basis. So I suspect we will see more and more. And when I said the 30, that's a mixture of capital and consumables, but it is across the Board in capital and consumables. We have a number of releases. I mentioned the biological indicator, that's a really nice change for us. We had a 24-hour biological indicator for hydrogen peroxide, which was the state-of-the-art. A few years back, we were the first also have one that went across our line as well as the J&J line, which was state-of-the-art. People have caught up with us and/or passed us and now we have a 20-minute biological indicator in that space, which is state-of-the-art. So that's just an example, but I could walk through 10 examples like that where either we're refreshing or bringing new products to market.
Matthew Mishan: And last two for me, I just wanted to follow-up on the more fired than smoke commentary around healthcare specialty services and that offsite central still processing model. What regions are you - is that is a US-based comment coming off of Northwell or is that in various international regions and the size of the type of projects you're seeing. You sized Northwell before, are they similar type product sizes or smaller, bigger? And then for Mike, I'm not sure if you updated the FX guidance or not? I think last quarter you said, you thought it would be favorable by $35 million.
Walter Rosebrough: I'll answer the first couple of questions. First of all, I was specifically talking about North America, Europe which is worth the outsourced CSDs started really was -- Europe has been fire for a long time. The synergy operation that one of the principle reasons we was interested in synergy was the European outsourced operations and they are growing and it continues to, but that's not -- that's not a novel thing in Europe. So I wasn't thinking of although they have more opportunities as well, but in North America as you know, we said this was a long project to create a nascent market in this space. And Northwell was kind of the lone example for a long time and we do expect to get that up here in the next bid, but has been slow to get started. But we now have a couple of other places that are pretty interesting. I think we're closing in on doing a couple of other ones. So generally speaking, I'd expect it to be smaller than Northwell. Northwell is a very large local IDN and so has a number of hospitals that are geographically concentric. I would expect most situations to be smaller.
Michael Tokich: And then, Matt, regarding the FX outlook, so if we use the forward rates at the end of December, our forecast would be still to have revenue positively impacted by about $35 million from the original outlook. And then EBIT is still about neutral as both the Pound and the Euro have increased more than the Peso and the Canadian Dollar.
Julie Winter: Matt, just to clarify on the year-over-year that translates to $20 million year-over-year on revenue. 35 million from the start of the year plan, 20 million year-over-year.
Walter Rosebrough: And both being neutral to EBIT.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: On healthcare capital equipment, just building on Dave's question from earlier, it sounds like the end markets remain favorable in the U.S. and maybe a little bit more favorable internationally. You may also get some benefit from currency there. So should we think about the decline this quarter as a function of timing, and should we see some of this come back in the fourth quarter? I just want to make sure we're thinking about that right.
Walter Rosebrough: Well, the answer is, yes. I think about it as timing when you look it – I'll call it long term timing and in the third quarter specifically. The fourth quarter, I would say, yes, except for if you talk year-over-over. If you talk quarter-over-quarter, yes. If you talk year-over-year, last year, we had an extraordinary capital shipment quarter. So year-over-year, I would not expect a radically different view based on timing. In fact, if anything is going to be tougher in terms of timing. But quarter-over-quarter, yes.
Unidentified Analyst: And then Walt, as you said earlier on - Live Times has put up some great numbers recently, Capital Equipment was up 33%, organic growth is up 14%. Can you maybe just elaborate on some of the drivers behind that growth and how sustainable that is as we move forward?
Walter Rosebrough: First of all, our Life Science folks have positioned themselves very nicely. On the consumable side we're pretty much focused on vaccines and biologics which are good places to be. We also think there is still significant upside in terms of what I’ll call penetration into that space. And so they've had a long history now of high single digit, sometimes double digit growth in that space, and we don't see that abating. On the capital side, those of you who followed us a long time know that we've had an eight-year drought if you will in Capital Equipment in Life Science. And it's all again focused in pharmaceutical plants or largely in pharmaceutical plants. But we've had a long drought. And the last year or so, we've clearly seen projects picking up, and that's Peso. What you saw early on was backlog growth. You know, we went from 30 million-ish. We felt happy if we were 40 million-ish backlog and now we're looking at 60 million-ish backlog. So pretty significant growth in backlog. And of course, it wasn't shipping, it wasn't shipping, it wasn't shipping because Life Science projects tend to be longer in nature, they are highly engineered commonly. So it may take six months to a year from the time we get an order till we deliver the order. Well, it's starting to ship now, started shipping two quarters ago. It's now shipped to the third quarter, and we don't really see an end to that at this point in time. So we've seen just strong - we've strong shipping and strong pipeline. So, we're quite confident. Now, some of that is obviously market. The pharmaceutical guys are putting money back into those spaces. I wouldn't be surprised to see more in the U.S. for the same tax reasons that we talked about. But another piece of it is our guys have done a really nice job of working on the hydrogen peroxide products in that space. In that space we have not unlike in healthcare. We have steam, we have washing, and we have hydrogen peroxide sterilization and the hydrogen peroxide is really, we've really strengthened that product line and has been a real good factor of our growth in that space.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Stratton from Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead with your question.
David Stratton: Regarding your CapEx guidance, it seems to have down by around $20 million from last quarter and I was wondering if you could bridge that gap especially in light of the tax windfall that everyone is receiving. What has caused your CapEx guidance to go down?
Michael Tokich: Dave, maybe timing of projects, some of these large projects that we have both largely in AST we forecast at the beginning of the year and we try and estimate the timing of that coming online and a couple of those just have had delays that have been normal delays. Nothing out of the ordinary, but those will push into next fiscal year. So that in total is about $20 million. You'll see the natural offset in free cash flow as free cash flow now goes for 280 to 300. But it's mainly due to timing.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal from Sidoti. Please go ahead with your question.
Mitra Ramgopal: Two questions. First Walter, as we look at your potential margin improvement, I was wondering if you're still expecting some cost synergies from the synergy health acquisition or is that pretty much done after fiscal '18?
Michael Tokich: We are expecting about $10 million this fiscal year and $10 million into next fiscal year and then we will have captured over $40 million in total, but there is still a little bit left out there.
Mitra Ramgopal: And regarding acquisitions, I know you've mentioned you're bringing on a number of new products in healthcare products and I was wondering if you're now more inclined to look at potential transactions that will actually expand the $10 billion addressable end market or just look to consolidate more within existing areas?
Walter Rosebrough: Our first and favorite type of acquisition is something that adds product or service to customers who are already serving in the space who are already serving and so that would be the first. So I'll call it for lack of better terms end customer, end market or whatever you want to call it. That's our first choice, but we're always looking at extensions to do as well. So it could be a different product or service. It's more likely to be with the customer who are already serving hopefully in the same space, we're serving them, but if not, right next door we're serving them. So we do like adjacent or tangential whatever terms you like acquisitions, a lot so better than the other kind. But we look at both all the time. We evaluate if we can bring something to them and/or they can bring something to us and we're really happy if the answer is yes to both questions.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I am showing no additional questions. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Thank you, everybody for joining us this morning. We hope to see many of you as we get out on the road in the coming month.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Walt.
Walter Rosebrough: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Our second quarter came in generally as accepted and we maintain our outlook for the year. Mike and I have brief prepared remarks regarding results of the year so far and our outlook for the full FY2018. We will then open for Q&A. Looking at the first half of our fiscal year; we are pleased that our overall results are in line with their expectations. Turning just to the second quarter we grew revenue 4% on a constant currency basis and our profit and earnings were in line with forecast. Of note, our Healthcare Specialty Services segment has now produced three consecutive quarters of higher than anticipated growth growing revenue 10% on a constant currency organic basis for both the quarter and the first half. On the other hand we believe the lack of growth in healthcare product capital equipment shipments in Q2 was largely a matter of timing. In particular, we saw solid underlying orders during the quarter, but we had lower shipments about $5 million of which was strictly due to the Hurricanes in Texas and Florida. These shipments are expected to occur in the second half of the fiscal year and are reflected in our $15 million sequential growth in backlog. I will add that we have no substantial operations in the specific areas impacted by Hurricanes, wildfires in Texas, Florida and California, but we do have sales and service people in those locations. Fortunately neither they nor their immediate families were injured in these natural disasters and our people have worked admirably with their hospital and life science customers to accommodate their needs. For the full first half of the fiscal year we are at the top end of our annual revenue guidance at 5% constant currency organic revenue growth. Our growth has been primarily volume with about 30 basis points in price so far this year slightly above our flat pricing expectation. Profitability has improved nicely as well with a 380 basis point improvement in gross margin and 190 basis point increase in EBIT margin. First, I have adjusted earnings of $1.79 per share reflect 7% growth over the prior year. We feel good about where we stand at the halfway point of our fiscal year and our reiterating our outlook for constant currency organic revenue growth of 45% and adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.96 to $4.09 per share. For the second half of the year we have tough comparisons in the fourth quarter as well as a headwind from the impact of storms in Puerto Rico where we do have an ASD facility. Annual revenue from that ASD facility is around $10 million in the normal operations. We have a great team in Puerto Rico and they and their U.S. counterparts managed this natural disaster as well as we could help from substantial preparations before the Hurricane landed in concert with our medical device customers to their eagerness to jump in and help following the storm. Thankfully all of our people and their immediate families were safe and we were able to account for everyone rather quickly. Naturally some of our people sustained considerable property damage and were left without many basic necessities and we are working with them on those issues. However, they brought the plant back to full operational status in about two weeks from the relatively minor damage to our facility. Although we have been fully operational for about a month now and have been processing products since that time we are dependent on our customers' ability to ship at their normal rates before our facility can operate near full capacity again. Our best estimate right now is that negative impact of the Puerto Rico storms on profit in ASD will be about $3 million this fiscal year virtually all of which will be recognized in the second half. Turning back to the Company as a whole currency movement continues to benefit the topline on an as reported basis. Given the six-month forward rates as the end of September we now anticipate that revenue will increase by approximately $35 million this fiscal year, primarily due to the strengthening of both the British pound in the euro versus the U.S. dollar. We now expect as reported revenue to be approximately flat for the full fiscal year and the increase versus earlier expectations is largely due to currency. We continue to expect virtually no currency impact on profitability even with a substantial swing in as reported revenue described earlier. This highlights the natural FX Hedge on profits built into our current business model. Despite the uncertainty in U.S. healthcare insurance programs the markets we serve generally continue to be stable. The revenue stream that we have created in terms of product, customer and geographic mix help to balance our growth and feel our ability to grow revenue mid single-digits organically and leverage that growth and business development opportunities for faster bottom line improvement. We are pleased with our current performance and believe we're well-positioned for the future. We appreciate your continued interest and support of STERIS and I will now turn the call over to Mike for a brief review of the second quarter before we open for Q&A.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter constant currency organic revenue growth was 4% driven by volume and 20 basis points of price. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter increased 360 basis points to 42.2% of which 260 basis points of the improvement is from the impact of divested businesses, with the remainder due to productivity improvements, favorable product mix and price. EBIT margin at 19.2% of revenue for the quarter represents a 200 basis point improvement. Obviously we are very pleased with our continued ability to expand EBIT margin and leverage revenue growth in addition to the favorable impact from the divested businesses. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.7%, up from both the prior year and first quarter as expected. Both the prior year and first quarter had favorable discrete item adjustments. We continue to expect the full year fiscal effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. Net income in the quarter was $80.3 million dollars or $0.94 per diluted share benefiting from both organic revenue growth and continued margin expansion. Segment growth information has been detailed in the pressure the press release in both the tables and the copy. In terms of the balance sheet we ended the quarter with $296 million of cash, $1.45 billion in total debt and a total debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 2.3 times. While the U.S. dollar equivalent value of our British pound sterling and euros are dominated private placement debt has increased due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. We have reduced our floating rate bank debt by $58 million since the end of the first quarter. As we said last quarter without additional acquisitions we continue to anticipate leverage by the end of the fiscal year to be approximately two times debt to EBITDA. Free cash flow for the first six months was $144 million, a 21% improvement versus the first half of last year, primarily due to higher net income. During the second quarter capital expenditures told $38.9 million while depreciation and amortization totaled $45.5 million. Our outlook for the full fiscal year free cash flow and capital expenditures are unchanged. Free cash flow is anticipated to be approximately $280 million and capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $180 million. With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to open Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike for your comments. Chad, we are ready to open for Q&A, so please give me instructions and we will get started?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Wanted to start a little bit on the margin side, it looks like gross margin came in a little better than we expected. Can you talk a little bit about mix versus price you might have had in effect on gross margin this quarter versus your baseline expectations?
Michael Tokich: Yes. Isaac, gross margin was up 360 basis points to 42.2%, similar improvement in the first quarter, about 260 basis points of that was really due to the impact of the divested businesses. If you recall the divested businesses most of their costs were in cost of goods sold, so that's what we're seeing the biggest improvement. And then in addition to that, we did have both productivity improvements in particular in our IMS North America business where that business continues to perform very well and we continue to see improvements in gross margin there. We did have some favorable mix obviously with capital down a little bit consumables and service especially consumables help propel the margin several basis points. And then we did have pricing impact which was about 20 basis points on the topline and about 10 basis points in the gross margin.
Isaac Ro: Great. And then on the expense side, it looks like SG&A came in a little higher than we forecast, obviously you have the upside gross margin to fund that. I'm interested in any potential areas of investment that you guys made that maybe came in ahead of plan because you have that extra profitability to work with, kind of curious where you're putting the marginal dollars? Thank you.
Michael Tokich: Yes. The bulk of the differential is foreign exchange, so our units that have OpEx in particularly the EU countries as well as Great Britain, it's an exchange rate issue. In terms of our run rate on a constant currency basis, it's very much what we expected.
Isaac Ro: Okay. Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question will come from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead.
Jason Rodgers: Good morning. So very strong performance this quarter in IMS, you talked a little bit about productivity improvements given that the margins there are already in the high single-digits. I think you said that was your expectation by the end of fiscal 2018. Where should we go from here? Should we expect the margins maybe to come down a little to the mid single-digits or what are you expecting in the second half for that segment? Thanks.
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. I would say a couple of things. First of all, clearly as we mentioned before, we had invested ahead of time and the revenue didn't come, so now we've allowed the revenue to come without additional investments. We will be going forward. We do need to go back into the game of investing at hopefully the appropriate time, so we can continue to grow. So we may see a little bit of rocking around those numbers, but in general our end point numbers that we described are what we anticipate in the short intermediate term for that business. So we might be a little higher one-month than we're one quarter and little lower one-month or one-quarter based on the timing of investments. But this is not like you have to build a plant and then start filling it. It's more modest incremental investment as a percentage of the total. So last year we just got it way wrong. We missed both directions growth and investment. That's an unusual occurrence for us and we've been doing service for long time, so we don't expect that kind of a significant change again.
Jason Rodgers: And the $3 million hit from the hurricanes, is an AST operating income, would you expect the majority of that to be realized in the third quarter or is it maybe more evenly spread in the second half?
Walter Rosebrough: It will be stronger in the third quarter than the fourth - we would expect our customers as they bring their plants, most of them are bringing their plants up; they're doing volume as just they're doing relatively more limited volume. A large part of that is because of energy issues or people issues in some cases, but generally speaking it's energy issues. Almost all of our customers have generation capability, but they don't always have enough generation that is generator capability to run all their machines and do all the things they need to do and then there are some people issues as well. So as they - they should be coming up and getting more close to full volumes, so as we approach the end of the quarter, we think we'll see much more at full volumes. So it will be more heavily seen in the third quarter.
Jason Rodgers: And then finally, I wondered if you can comment on hospital spending globally, if you're seeing any material change by region. And what was the performance on organic basis in the international segment for the quarter that is it? Thank you.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, sir. From an international standpoint, looking at both the quarter and the year, we continue to see good growth in both Europe and APAC, slightly slower growth although we are growing in Latin America and North America. Although for the quarter, obviously with healthcare capital equipment being down a little bit, North America was more under pressure just based on the timing. And I would add to that Europe, which we call EMEA. Europe itself has been now for quite some time, steady to nice slightly growing if you will. The Middle East has been very difficult, but it seems like we should the bottom of that trough and there is some life in the Middle East again. So although it's not the levels it was three years ago. It is picking back up for us.
Operator: The next question will come from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Lawrence Keusch: Yes, hi good morning. Walt or Mike, so I just want to be clear on the hurricane impact on the possible capital side, so you obviously said $5 million, what's the right way to think about the organic constant currency growth then for the quarter, if you kind of adjust for those shipments that you didn't get and I know volume plays a very large part in the equation here particularly on the capital side. So anyway that to sort of think about one in EPS impact from that delay shipment was?
Michael Tokich: Sure, Larry, You've asked a multiple questions, so I'll try to kind of break them out. Those orders were again largely Florida and Texas for the capital equipment orders and it was hospitals that obviously were under pressure from the storm and they did not want to take new capital into their facilities or haven't' shipped during that timeframe. So it was around $5 million. Orders of magnitude, that's probably about a $2 million to $2.5 million impact on bottom line profitability in the quarter. We would expect to see that reverse and I think Larry that we would expect that to reverse kind of the exact same way, that we talked about AST that is - I would expect to see more of in the third quarter because most of the hospitals were not severely damaged. They just couldn't take equipment during that timeframe. And so the bulk of that should reverse in Q3 and there will be some of the drags into Q4 would be my guess. So - and in terms of relative growth or growth numbers, the hurricane itself is about $5 million, which is roughly small one, 1%-ish for the total business, of course as you get down to smaller pieces of the business, it's a larger percentage 2% or 3% for health care capital probably. But orders of magnitude, it did not have a huge impact on revenue growth for the total company. Now the other side is, we did see more orders than shipments and so our backlog picked up $15 million, only $5 million of which is the storm. So we have $10 million more in backlog sequentially than we did before that is purely a matter of - I'll call it normal time differentials across quarters. That just happens in the capital business, but the $5 million is purely due to the storm.
Lawrence Keusch: So 5% sort of were again a constant currency, is that the right way to kind of think of again on sort of a normalized basis [indiscernible] $5 million on comp?
Michael Tokich: Yes, orders of magnitude, you're not too far off, because those 4% roughly for the total business is about a point, so without doing the exact math that's close.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, perfect. And then two other questions, maybe talk a little bit what's going on in Life Sciences that backlog continues to do well. And then Walt, I guess just a bigger picture question around the endoscopy markets. I know you're obviously are competitor in a variety of different places there, but that market continues to be growing very nicely and just want to get your thoughts on perhaps additional opportunities to expand into endoscopy broadly.
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Larry and I'll separate again two questions. The Life Science business in total is doing very nicely as you've observed, not only of the consumable side of the business, which has been a long-term good grower for us is continuing to grow in the mid to high single-digit range. But the capital business has clearly begun to come back and we're just seeing order rates and as a result backlog that we haven't seen in a decade or more. In our pipeline appears to be about the same as what our current run rates are. So we're anticipating it's hard to forecast more than a year or two out but are going in view is that that this level of orders and shipments in life science and will continue probably 12 months to 18 months at least. So we're feeling quite good about that. A piece of that is the market this business supports biologics and vaccines and that's a nicely growing market it had spent a fair amount of time consolidating the last few years that is pharma in general and we think that consolidation phase for at least our pieces of the business is largely finished. And then the second piece is we've done some nice progress on work particularly in the hydrogen peroxide area where we're in our capital equipment where that is a growth area for us. So it's a combination of the market growing more rapidly and us having a nicely set of products to put into that market in the space. So the life science guys have done the nice job of that. As relates endoscopy we do view the endoscopy market as a growth market and growth opportunity US Endoscopy has now which we purchased five plus years ago has been growing in near double-digits almost every year in the topline and therefore above and certainly double-digits on the bottom line. So that has been a growth opportunity we continue to look for ways to expand we've done a number of smaller acquisitions in that space to add into what the US Endoscopy people care. And then we also view that as an opportunity in our Healthcare Products segment both on the consumables and on the capital side. So we continue to invest in that space.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay. And then lastly just on ASD. I guess Sterilmed was moved into that piece I believe. Can you just help us think about the impact of that on the growth there?
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Larry, as we as we talked last quarter we believe that for the full-year we will have about 100 basis points which is basically every quarter 100 basis points both top and bottom line impact because that business as we've talked about is actually declining in both top and bottom line year-over-year. So about 100 basis points is the number - fair number to use.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay.
Michael Tokich: If you think of ASD is pure ASD absence Sterilmed would be about 100 basis points stronger.
Walter Rosebrough: Top and bottom.
Lawrence Keusch: Right. Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question will be from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Walter Rosebrough: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Mishan: Hey, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. How are doing?
Walter Rosebrough: Great.
Matthew Mishan: Could you maybe go a little bit more detail on the Healthcare Specialty Services and talk about the trends you're seeing in North America IMS versus the offsite central processing model and the UK and Europe? And are they both growing like equivalently are they both growing double-digits or is one growing faster than the other?
Michael Tokich: I would step back and say that in general the IMS business in North America is the driver for that double-digit growth rate. And so now I'm talking more - longer term the last 12 months not the last three. The European business in HSS or the outsources did have some nice growth in Q2 some of that was currency, but some of that is also called natural growth in the European business. And we are also as we talked about moving instant repair into the European model and that is causing us to experience some nice growth and we're reversing in working to do the opposite in the U.S. move more of the outsourcing business in HSS. We think those are both are significant growth opportunities for the future, but they're both still relatively nascent businesses right now.
Matthew Mishan: Okay. I can help me explain the sequential margin improvement in the Healthcare Specialty Services now - if it's a tremendous amount of improvement year-over-year but a lot of that it did it investors but you saw a big improvement from 1Q to 2Q and a big jump there? What drove that?
Walter Rosebrough: Well, I mean again as we've talked it's largely a matter of allowing our revenue growth to catch up to the costs that we had put in place. So at a high level that's it and it's been obviously both sequential over the last two or three quarters as well as the comparison year-over-year, you are correct, the comparison year-over-year, the removal of the laundry business has clearly helped that, but on a sequential basis, it's also improved.
Michael Tokich: Some of that Matt is also volume. We grew $3 million in total sequentially so…
Walter Rosebrough: And didn't raise our cost.
Michael Tokich: Right, exactly.
Walter Rosebrough: We grew into our cost basis.
Matthew Mishan: And then switching to - what is the acquisition pipeline look like for you guys right now? Your leverage is down significantly, and is there an opportunity to start adding to the various platforms?
Walter Rosebrough: Well, absolutely we believe that we past the bulk of the synergy integration. That doesn't mean we don't have - we still have IT type systems and back office type systems we are working on, but the bulk of that integration is complete, so we do not feel any concerns about adding other businesses. And as you mature our leverage ratio, we've brought it down as we suggested we would, so we are actively looking at things. We never discuss specific pipeline issues, but we are looking at a number of opportunities. We just wish they would come in the timing that we would like them as opposed to the timing that they occur.
Matthew Mishan: And then last question just on the last divestiture that I don't think is closed yet. What impact did that have on the guidance and what's the latest update on that?
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. As we mentioned last time, the purchaser has had difficulty with financing and some other issues, and so that has not closed. It's not material really to the business in any way. There's no profit impact either past or forward of consequence. The revenue impact is in the $10 million-ish number per quarter roughly speaking and we have not anticipated that in our guidance going forward. So we've anticipated no. In fact, there's no growth, so since our revenue guidance as far as on growth, we're not anticipating any growth, the numbers really to be there or not. It's not clear to us that deal will close. And so the longer the time takes, the longer it is, but it's really not a material conversation for us.
Matthew Mishan: All right. Thank you very much Walter, Mike and Julie.
Operator: The next question will be from Chris Cooley with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Chris Cooley: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
Walter Rosebrough: Good morning.
Chris Cooley: Just a couple for me at this point in the call. Could you just clarify for us Walt on the growth in the pipeline on healthcare capital? Should we think about that as traditional replacement capital just in terms of our flow through versus more than new project type build, and maybe if you would expand upon that a little bit? Just if you are seeing any kind of a changes in the capital environment. And then as a follow-on, those comp growth continuing I think particularly on the Life Sciences capital better than what we have modeled here during the quarter. Just curious if you are seeing an uptick in terms of utilizations where newer technologies like disposable columns as we see growth in biologics and then [indiscernible] relative to that? Thanks so much.
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. Chris, just to make it clear, we understood the Life Sciences questions, but the first question, it was unclear to me whether you are talking or asking about our capital spending or the markets capital spending.
Chris Cooley: On markets.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. So the short answer to that is we have not seen a significant change in that space now for a long time, several years. That is it is not growing rapidly. It's also not shrinking, so it's been kind of flat to modest single digits uptick if you will. And there are differences that it has floated back and forth between what I call major projects and replacement. The last I'd say couple quarters, it's beginning to look at our normal rates if you will 60% to 70% replacement, 30%, 35% of new capital if you will or large projects. So the nature of the projects have started looking more similar. A couple things have changed though that we're seeing more and more particularly in the operating room area which also affects CSDs. We are seeing more Ambulatory Surgery Centers being built both by freestanding Ambulatory Surgery Center units if you will, some are for profit, some not for profit and we're seeing more of those being built by hospitals as outposts if you will for their major hospital says that more and more surgeries are being brought to that level because we can get people out quicker. So for example, we're seeing a lot more orthopedics being done in either overnight surgery or even day surgery. So we're seeing more of that being built out in the suburbs if you will as opposed to inside the major center downtown. So a bit of a shift there, the last 12 to 18 months, but in total it has not affected the spend greatly. In Life Science, there is no question. In Life Science that the new technology that we have brought forward in hydrogen peroxide sterilization for their facilities has been a strong driver for both of them to do more and has helped us grow the business. It's just - that technology is a particularly good technology for that space and we've capitalized on it. As it relates to disposables, it's unclear depending on how fast those markets grow. How that affects us, but on the one hand if we will do less clean in place kind of work, if disposable small disposables are used, on the other hand we sterilize those disposable units of AST. So we may see a shifting of revenue from one to the other. But with the growth rates are experiencing, we still review that as a growing market.
Chris Cooley: Thank you and I can squeeze one more in if we have time?
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Chris.
Chris Cooley: Just curious if you're seeing any additional opportunities, I'm assuming predominately outside the - would have to be outside of the United States with your outsourced initiatives there. Can you bring on incremental capacity from private hospitals? Are you starting to see that and if so, is that something that could either further enhance the AST margin or should we think about that is more of a sustainable growth driver to keep us in the kind of the high single digits, when we think about that franchise longer term? Thanks again and congratulations on a good quarter.
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks, Chris. Yes, we do see there are a couple of countries that we're looking at that we may put in the HSS model of outsourced CSDs and that that would bring up the growth rate because we're relatively significant in UK, which is our principal country. We have facilities in both Netherlands and Italy and those are both we think opportunities with couple other countries that I will go into at this time. But we are looking at a couple other countries in that space. The real growth opportunities in the U.S. market though and that's where we're focusing most of our efforts.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question will be from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Please go ahead.
Mitra Ramgopal: Yes, good morning. Just a couple questions, Walt, I was wondering given your pretty much finished with the plan divestitures as you exit fiscal 2018. Do you feel comfortable that the businesses you have right now, are the ones you want to be in?
Walter Rosebrough: That's unfortunately conversation divestitures are a lot like conversations about acquisitions, the less you talk about a before and the better, so - but if you look broadly across what we're doing our four major segments? We think all those segments have good opportunities and we think all of those segments have - across most of those segments, there's a tie to one or more of the other businesses within another segment or completely across segment. So we think we do have a very nice portfolio in terms of sterilization and in procedural areas that are commonly in the same spaces as those sterile units. So in my mind there's not a significant divestiture in the short and medium-term anyway.
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay, thanks. And again now, when we look at the strength you're seeing in terms of the backlog and the large projects that are you're bringing on. Is it more a case of increasing the sell through to existing customers or are you also seeing a lot of new customers coming onboard now?
Walter Rosebrough: It is a combination. It is principally sell through to existing customers, but we do see entrance in that space, the vaccine biologic space is “an exciting space” in Pharma right now and there are some new biologics is being developed by folks out there, so we see both. But the principal numbers are with the people that are already in the space.
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay, thanks again for taking questions.
Walter Rosebrough: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Winter, for any concluding remarks.
Julie Winter: Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing some of you on the road in the coming months and chat with you soon.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the STERIS Plc First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Julie Winter, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. As usual, on today's call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited.

Many of these important factors are outside of STERIS' control. No assurances can be provided as to any results or the timing of any outcome regarding matters described in this webcast or otherwise. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and on our website. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic growth, and free cash flow are all non-GAAP measures that may be used from time to time during this call and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. STERIS' adjusted earnings per diluted share and segment operating income exclude the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, acquisition-related transaction costs, integration costs related to acquisitions and certain other unusual or nonrecurring items. To measure constant currency organic revenue, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions, and divestitures that affect the comparability and trends in revenue are removed. We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles, net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant equipment and intangibles. Additional information regarding adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow is available in today's release. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Walt.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Thanks, Julie, and good morning to all of you joining us for our first quarter call. I will leave the details of the quarterly financial results to Mike, but will say that we are pleased to start fiscal 2018 with a strong first quarter. We had constant currency organic revenue growth in all segment, and we improved profitability nicely compared with the prior year, a 180 basis point increase in operating profit margin. We're particularly pleased with the progress that our Healthcare Specialty Services segment demonstrated in the quarter, growing revenue double digits on a constant currency organic basis and driving operating income improvement as a result. In fact, the North America IMS business is somewhat ahead of their profit plan so far this year. Collectively, our business grew adjusted earnings per diluted share 8% to $0.85 a share. Given our performance in the first quarter, we are maintaining our outlook for the fiscal year for constant currency organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.96 per share to $4.09 per share. From a constant currency organic revenue perspective, we will have tough comparisons versus our very strong fourth quarter of FY 2017 which is a bit of a headwind in our full-year organic revenue growth forecast, but we remain comfortable with our plan. The most significant change in our as-reported revenue forecast since we discussed our outlook last quarter is the currency movements that have occurred. Looking at the nine months forward rates as of the end of June, we now anticipate the revenue will benefit by approximately $10 million this fiscal year due to the forecasted increases in both the British pound and the euro. That is a $25 million favorable swing from our prior expectation of $15 million negative to as-reported revenue. As we said since the Synergy combination, our combined business will probably have greater swings in as-reported revenue due to currency movements than traditional STERIS, but will likely be more balanced on profit. This has held true so far this year. We originally anticipated currency to be roughly neutral to profit this fiscal year and that is still the case today even with the substantial swing in as-reported revenue expectation. Given our basket of currencies, we have somewhat of a natural hedge from a profit perspective if the major currencies generally move together versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, we no longer expect our as-reported revenue to decline 2% to 3% due to the divestitures as we originally thought even though our constant currency organic revenue expectation has not changed. In addition, we have not yet completed our last planned divestiture, and that business contributed about $10 million of revenue during the first quarter although with minimal profit. Due primarily to these two factors, we now expect as-reported revenue to be down only 1% to 2% for the full fiscal year. We continue to feel good about where we stand today and what the future holds as we serve healthcare, life science and medical device customers with procedural products as well as the broadest and deepest portfolio of sterilization, disinfection and decontamination products and services around the globe. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike to discuss the detailed quarterly financial results before we open for Q&A. Michael?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our first quarter financial results. We started the year strong with total constant currency organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, driven by volume and 40 basis points of price. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter increased 410 basis points to 42.3%. The improvement in gross margin was due to favorable impact of divested lower margin businesses, improvements in operational efficiencies including the realization of cost synergies, fluctuations in currency and pricing. EBIT margin at 17.7% of revenue for the quarter represents a 180 basis point year-over-year improvement. We are very pleased with our continued ability to expand EBIT margins and leverage revenue growth. The effective tax rate in the quarter was down somewhat to 23.1% versus the prior year as we had favorable discrete item adjustments in the quarter. We continue to expect the full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. Net income in the quarter was $73.2 million or $0.85 per diluted share, benefiting from organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion, and a lower effective tax rate. Before I get into the details of the segments, I want to point out that we have made a couple of organizational changes to better align with our customers. These changes have resulted in several small business lines shifting between segments. First, we have eliminated our Defense and Industrial business unit, which has always had modest amounts of revenue, and shifted those revenues into the Healthcare Products and Life Sciences segments as appropriate. The other change we made was to move the Sterilmed contract, which totals about $20 million of annual revenue, from the Healthcare Specialty Services segment to the Applied Sterilization Technologies segment to be more in line with the customer served. The net impact of this move will trim AST's revenue growth and reduce the segment's operating margin by about 100 basis points. As we said in the press release, we will recast prior-year periods each quarter for comparability purposes. Healthcare Products segment as reported revenue grew 2% in the quarter. Growth was driven by a 7% increase in service revenue and a 2% improvement in capital equipment, following our record fourth quarter. This growth was slightly offset by a 1% decline in consumable revenue caused by the divestiture of our skin care business, which reduced revenue by about $10 million in the quarter as compared to the prior year. We will anniversary the skin care business divestiture during the second quarter. Within capital equipment, we saw strength in our V-PRO product family and across our surgical products portfolio. Constant currency organic revenue in Healthcare Products grew 5% in the quarter. Backlog in Healthcare Products at $135 million improved sequentially by over $25 million. Healthcare Products operating income increased 17% and operating margins improved by 190 basis points to 14.6% of revenue. The margin increase is due to greater volumes and the improvement in gross margin. Revenue for Healthcare Specialty Services increased 11% on a constant currency organic basis, with strength in both IMS North America and our CSD outsourcing business in Europe. Healthcare Specialty Services operating income for the first quarter more than doubled from $2.5 million in the prior year to $6 million, reflecting continuing improvements in the IMS North American business. Applied Sterilization Technologies grew revenue 6% on a constant currency organic basis driven by increased demand from our core medical device customers. Operating margins, which now include the impact of the Sterilmed contract, were flat at 33.1% of revenue. Life Sciences as-reported revenue for the quarter declined 1%. Service revenue increased 5% and consumable revenue grew 2%. Capital equipment shipments were down 12% in the quarter. While shipments of capital equipment were soft, our order levels were quite strong. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $67 million. In addition to lower capital equipment shipments, Life Sciences consumable revenue growth was impacted by a tough year-over-year comparison. Constant currency organic revenue growth in Life Sciences was 1% in the quarter. Life Sciences first quarter operating margin declined 280 basis points to 27% of revenue, due primarily to the decline in capital equipment revenue. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $295 million of cash, approximately $1.5 billion in total debt, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.5 times. As you may recall, when we completed our most recent private placement offering in February, it was the first time we issued debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As the British pound and the euro strengthen relative to the U.S. dollar, the value of our debt increases. As a result, our debt levels increased from the end of fiscal 2017. Without additional acquisitions, we continue to anticipate leverage by the end of fiscal 2018 to approach 2 times debt-to-EBITDA using current forward exchange rates. Free cash flow for the quarter was $44.2 million, down slightly from the prior year as the prior year benefited from the positive cash contributions from our divested businesses along with proceeds from the sale of assets. During the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $36.5 million while depreciation and amortization was $43.7 million. With that, I will now turn the call over to Julie to open Q&A. Julie?
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Walt and Mike for your comments. Jamie, would you please give the instructions so we can get started with Q&A?
Operator: Our first question today comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. Just looking at the way the divisions turned out in the quarter and knowing you have some moving parts, I was wondering, from a constant currency organic growth, if you could just talk to how you expect sort of the rest of the year to come out for the four divisions. I imagine we're going to expect Life Sciences to increase as some of that backlog comes through, but any color on sort of mid-single, low-single, what you're looking for, for the four segments?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Dave. This is Mike. For the most part, we will be in the mid-single digits as we get all of our individual segments. And in regards to Life Sciences, yeah, we believe Life Sciences definitely will come back. They did have a soft quarter. But with the record backlog, we feel very comfortable that the capital equipment shipments will be there. As usual, AST is probably the leader of our organic constant currency growth, although they will be slightly impacted by the change of the Sterilmed contract now being accounted for in that business.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: And just one quick follow-up on AST. I mean, I know you've had some new capacity online, but could you just remind us where you stand today and if there are any other facilities that are coming online in the remainder of fiscal 2018?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. Dave, there are a few facilities that are yet to open later this year. Actually, I think there's like three or four off top of my head that are yet to open. As you recall, we have spent quite a bit of money over the last year and into this year to open or expand about six or seven new facilities. Bulk of those will be online by the end of this year with a couple coming into fiscal year 2018.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: 2019.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: 2019. Sorry. Sorry.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: 2019. And we do – that's a mixture of kind of significant expansion, and I call it generalized expansion. And we're just adding a chamber some place that's relatively inexpensive, relatively simple to do, but there are some of these that are pretty large expansion, and those take a little bit longer.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike or Walt, I was wondering if we could just start with the free cash flow. So I think your guidance was $280 million and you did kind of low $40-million-ish in the first quarter. So what helps ramp that up through the year to get to that $280 million.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Larry. It's a good question. And what you want to look back is on our historical basis. Our fourth quarter net income is 40%-plus growth versus our first quarter. So that's really the main driver of the increase. And historically that's been the pattern that we've had. We started much lower than we would have ended. So you can't just take first quarter and multiply by four, you'll never get there.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Got you. And...
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: The second component there, Larry, as we've talked many times, we build – production and revenue grow over the course of the year, and so it's not uncommon for us to build inventory ahead of anticipated shipments. So we're not trying to have our plants run 30% faster at the end of the year as opposed to maybe 10% or 15% faster. And so, we do build some inventory over the course of the year anticipating the year-end growth. So I would say that's relatively minor compared to the point Mike made, but it is clearly a point.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just a couple of other quick ones. So just staying on the financial and then just one or two quick business line item issues. But on the gross margin, obviously, very strong, very nice to see. How do we think about that gross margin, whether there were any sort of one-timers there that really influenced that level, or is that kind of the right way to think about the run rate going forward now that you've divested the businesses and have been working on your operating efficiencies?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I would say, one of the large drivers of that 410 basis point improvement to 42.3% gross margin were the divestitures. That represented about 300 basis point of that 410 basis point improvement. We did also get a bit of currency, and we did get a bit of price. And then we also did have some operational efficiencies, including – we are still anticipating about $10 million of cost synergies this year from the Synergy Health transaction, and we are on track for that. So we've got a couple-of-million-dollars of savings in this quarter also.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then...
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Larry, I would comment. I mean, Mike has laid out the component, but those components are all go-forward-type components. So I do not see this being a one-time type of spike.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Excellent. And then just lastly, if you could just comment, again, you mentioned in your prepared statements, IMS North America sounds like it's a little bit ahead of plan on profitability. And so just any sort of commentary on how that business is performing given some of the challenges last year relative to your expectations. And then on the Life Sciences side, the backlog obviously I think certainly explains the weakness in the capital side and looks like it's a timing issue. But one thing that you ran into on the hospital front was for this mix of project versus sort of what I'll call routine capital orders. Is that dynamic similar in Life Sciences or can you – you kind of get a better feel for when that backlog goes up that you'll be able to convert that to revenues through the year?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. Let me take the two questions, first on HSS and predominantly IMS in North America, as you know, they had significant objective this year to improve their profitability. Although we fully anticipated that would happen, and they have a good plan and a good approach. And the fourth quarter was the beginning of that. And so we were pleased – we are even more pleased that they continue to execute that plan. So they still have ways to go, and they're working down their plan. But at this moment, they are actually a bit ahead of their plan both in terms of revenue growth. We had a double-digit increase in revenue growth and that's not our current expectation. We've been saying that we think the long term might be a bit lower. And so they had a nice pop in revenue growth and then they've also converted that to profitability. So we're very pleased with that progress. They still have work to do. As it relates to the Life Sciences, I've been hesitant to call a new era in the capital business in Life Sciences for a long time because as you know, if you go way back 10 years ago, 12 years ago, that was a pretty robust business that kind of disappeared as big pharma consolidated and closed plants and did those things. So it was – we did a significant drop in revenue. We hit the bottom probably seven, eight years ago, and we've just been holding steady at those level, it bounces a little bit, but holding steady at those levels. But we are seeing both project orders – significant orders and pipeline of orders that does appear to be different. We mentioned that last time, it does appear to be different than that historic trend. So we hate to be projecting too far out in the future but for the next six, 12 months, I would say that we clearly are seeing strength in that business. That's partially – there's more orders in the business that we serve the biopharma and vaccine business, and those businesses are strong. And it seems like a lot of their consolidation may be over and they're now reinvesting in their plants more than they had in the last four, five years. But it's also the products that our guys have put in place. We have a number of new products in washing, in steam, and in hydrogen peroxide that have all done really – let's just say have been received nicely in the field. So those two things in concert, there's a bit of a drift up that we think in the market and a bit of a drift up because of our new products. Having said that, the business doesn't look exactly like our Healthcare business. There is less of what I'll call the routine business and it's more project-oriented. Even on an individual basis, some of these sterilizers, instead of being $30,000, they might be $0.5 million. Some of these sterilizers are of the size of rooms, not the size of an oven in your kitchen. And as a result, it does tend to be lumpier. Projects do have a habit of getting delayed by customers. So there is always more risk in any given quarter or even any given year. If the orders are sitting in the third and fourth quarter, they can move out. So there is more risk of that. It is exceedingly rare for them to disappear because these are typically specialized products, specialized orders. So they're on the line. Once the order is in the house, they're on the line to make good on the order. So they – it is rare for them to disappear. It is not rare for them to slide. We are comfortable with where our forecast is right now. If everybody stayed on their projection, if our customers stayed on their projection, we would exceed our forecast. Our experience is they don't stay on their projection. So we think our forecast is where it should be.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Excellent. Thanks, everyone, for the responses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking questions.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Can you start with the AST capacity expansions, and what that may mean for kind of revenue growth for that segment in FY 2018 and FY 2019? And is that capacity filled and accounted for already or is that something that you're going to – once it's open then you're going to go ahead and find customers for?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. Good question. Because there are a number of expansions here, you cannot answer it, most of your questions, one or the other. The answer is – almost every part of your question, the answer is yes. There are a number – particularly the larger expansions, it is rare for us to do really significant expansions without having a customer on board that we know is going to take at least a base load of that expansion. And that is typical in these cases. There are times when we just – if we're in a concentrated area, for example in the Northeast of the United States, where we will kind of do it "on spec", but that is relatively rare. And again, we know the customers are there. We're working with them. We may not have a guarantee. But generally speaking for the large expansions, we have if not a guarantee – sometimes we actually have a take-or-pay guarantee, we have long term contracts. There are a number of things we do to make sure that we're not expanding in the face of uncertainty. Having said that, there's also just generalized expansion. In no cases in the expansion is it completely sold because we don't ever want to be in a position where our plants are completely sold out. We are always trying to build capacity ahead of them being completely full because that doesn't leave us or our customers any turnaround capacity. We want to make sure we have that. So we do try to avoid that issue as we build, and we will try to get it in the right places. And then I think the final answer is we're talking mid to upper mid kind of growth rates in that space. And so, by definition, you have to expand something like that level all the time. We have 60 plants now. So they're not all the same size, but if you just think through the math, you're growing 7%. That's four plants a year, on average. They're not all plants. They may be three new chambers in eight plants, but as a general rule, we will almost always be expanding that because we do tend to run toward capacity in the 75%, 80% level. So we're always going to be needing to build ahead to provide that capacity.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then moving over to the Healthcare Products backlog, I mean, it was the second straight quarter that that was down. Is that at all concerning for you that year-over-year, it's been down? And then your general thoughts on what your customers are indicating around hospital capital spending trends.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure. Well, just like our Life Sciences backlog being really up, we love backlog to be really up. On a year-over-year basis, we are down a little bit. But if you look at it sequentially, we've been gaining since the huge fourth quarter – basically, we shipped a lot in the fourth quarter of last year. And we – you see it kind of quarterly. We see it monthly. We've been growing sequentially with orders. So it's not overly concerning to us, no. Would we like to have $30 million more? Of course. Always. No matter where we are, we would like to have $30 million more. So we're comfortable with the backlog we have. I would characterize – and I think we've seen enough of the other capital equipment makers – talking specifically about North America now. I would characterize the market as stable, not growing double digits. It's not shrinking. It may be growing by a few percentage points, low-single digits probably in capital right now, but certainly stable. And I view stable – given the level of uncertainty right now in healthcare, I view stable as positive. We're just not seeing – we're not seeing a result of the uncertainty that's clearly out there for healthcare providers.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And the final divestiture that just doesn't seem you want to close. Is that – have you still included a $30 million impact for the second, third and fourth quarters in that, or have you removed it? And why is it – and what is the delay in the closing of that business?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: We have not included ongoing revenue in our forecast. That's the first answer. And the second answer is this is about the buyer's financing, it's not about the business. So it's timing and all those thing around their financing. And I call deals sometimes they happen, sometimes they don't. We still expect this one to happen, but it could not. If it doesn't, that's not a crisis. We just have to report different numbers. But this business isn't hurting us, it just don't fit with what we're doing. So that's kind of the issue. We are still hopeful that we will get those things closed in the next little bit, but it is around their financing.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much and nice quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joel Kaufman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. First, I just want to start on the pricing. Positive this quarter. Just wondering to what extent that was a function of mix, better performance of consumables, some recurring revenue relative to capital equipment. And then maybe what's assumed in the outlook for the remainder of the year on pricing?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. As I said earlier, we did get about 40 basis points of pricing, and that was basically a little bit here and a little bit there. It really wasn't any one segment driving the majority of that price. As we stated in April or May when we had our last call, we were assuming zero price in the forecast or the outlook for the year. We are still assuming no additional price in our current outlook.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: And another piece, mix. We do not count mix in price. So there is no mix in price. Where we put mix across product is in volume.
Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thanks. And then maybe shifting – staying with the Healthcare Products side of the business, any comment on the competitive dynamics that are happening there? It seems, from what I can tell, you guys are growing above market, maybe mid- to high-single digits on the recurring side of the business. Just trying to understand if you guys are picking up any market share?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: In the short run, that's always very difficult to measure. You're talking half a percentage point. We don't have good enough visibility, I'd say, in the short run to answer that question. We are comfortable with our position in the capital equipment business and in the consumable business in Healthcare particularly in North America. And we're actually seeing some turn in our OUS business as well. We mentioned last time it seems like a couple of years that have been sliding, have been bottomed or turning around, and we do see that. So again, I wouldn't characterize it as any significant change in market share, but we're comfortable where we are.
Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then, Mike, I may have missed this on the call, but could you just help bridge the walk from the updated FX assumption raising the reported revenue guidance for the year and then maintaining the EPS range. Just how that flows through on the profitability side?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah, certainly. So if you look at FX, if you look at our forecasted rates, we are forecasting that all four of our major currencies, the Canadian dollar, the euro, the peso and the pound will strengthen compared to the U.S. dollar. And if you step back, we like a strong euro and a strong GBP because that's really where we have our revenue and our expenses associated with that revenue. So as we get more strength in those two currencies, obviously, we get a pickup in revenue and a slight pickup in profitability. At the same point in time, the peso and the Canadian dollars where we have our manufacturing facility, so that's really where we have our costs. So as those currencies strengthen, our cost increase. So we got a nice increase in potential revenue from the euro and the pound, but we get a potential decrease in profitability as the Canadian dollar and the peso all rise in it. Fortunately or unfortunately, all four are going in the same direction, which leads us to our analysis.
Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Very helpful.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: One way to think about it is there is a shift due to that currency, the businesses that are service business in Europe and Britain will increase their profitability with the strengthening euro and pound. And the Healthcare and Life Sciences business that have manufacturing largely the capital equipment business because the other businesses that are U.S.-based. But the – I should say the IPT capital equipment business and the Life Sciences business were built in Canada and Mexico have the opposite effect. And it just so happens they're roughly similar effect. So if those four currencies move in lockstep with the dollar, let's say, 5% up or 5% in lockstep, there tends to be no profit, so we have a natural hedge which we do a deposit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. I appreciate you taking the questions.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Just maybe just a couple quick house-cleaning ones from me at this juncture. Could you maybe characterize, either Walter or Mike, just the Healthcare backlog? That $25 million that you saw increased sequentially. Could you break that out between new projects or newbuild versus replacement? I just want to make sure we don't get over our skis if there's any kind of change in that like we saw roughly a year ago. And then similarly, could you – maybe if I missed this, I'm juggling on a couple of calls this morning, but did you also reaffirm the cash flow guidance for the full fiscal year? And I have just one other follow-up. Thanks.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Chris. This is Mike. We did reaffirm the cash flow – free cash flow guidance that we gave last time. I think that was $280 million is our outlook. As far as backlog, we've actually – if you remember last year at this point in time, we did flip flop in Healthcare and we actually saw more project business, which caused our backlog to stay longer and our shipments to occur later in the year. This year, we're actually seeing the opposite. We're back more to our historic 70% project – or sorry 70% replacement and 30% project business. So it's actually flipped. And actually we saw that changing probably late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So that's where we are right now, Chris.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Super. And then maybe, Walt, could you maybe just walk us through what you're seeing as both the kind of tailwinds and the headwinds here that would put you either at the lower or the upper bound of guidance. I appreciate that it's a great start to the fiscal year, but still very early days. But just kind of curious what you're watching most intently when you're thinking about both into the range there. Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure, Chris. Clearly, healthcare reform is top on our list of things to watch. It has been now for, I don't know, a year-and-a-half maybe. And so – and I've already commented that we have not seen what I would I call a significant effect through the uncertainty of healthcare reform as it relates to capital spending. Capital spending loves change. It doesn't like uncertainty very much. So we are watching that. That's why we've already commented I think other people like us who do capital equipment are seeing and saying the same thing that it's a stable environment. It doesn't seem like there's a lot of reaction to uncertainty. People are more business as usual as it turns – in terms of capital spending in U.S. hospitals, but that is something clearly we'll be wanting to watch. On the consumable side, you may recall we had a little bit of a scare in the December timeframe last year. It just shrunk surprisingly to us in all three of the market segments. That has clearly come back, and I think in almost every cases, not all cases, not only has it come back, but we've made up what the apparent loss was. So we're keeping an eye on that. We still don't quite understand that. So come toward the end of this year – we think it probably was holiday effect, just the way the holidays happen to turn, and we had a few customers that did some plant closings and things like that. So we'll be watching that again, but we have no indication and no reason to believe it's any different from our normal pattern. The international business does seem to be bottoming and coming back in some of the places where we've had some real turns in the last couple of years. Latin America seems to be picking back up for us at least. And the Middle East, which had been absolutely dry, we're beginning to see some volume in that space again. Europe has remained pretty consistent for us anyway. So that's remained the same. And the Pacific Rim has actually picked up significantly for us. So – I'm talking about Healthcare. So kind of in general. And when the world economy has picked up which as you guys know, that is happening, it puts less pressure on the governments to control healthcare spending. And so to the extent the world economies pick up, that's a positive for us. And even though we've talked about the dollar, how it sits versus other currency, again, these are the accounting effects we've described. But when the dollar strengthens, it makes it harder to sell U.S.-built product in other places. When those currencies strengthen versus the dollar, it makes it easier. So I think that's part of the reason we've seen some pickup in the OUS part of STERIS business. So those are the things we're watching. Right now, I would call that stable to positive.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. And maybe I can squeeze one last one here. Just following on that thought process, are you seeing stability as well in commodities pricing, in particular Cobalt-60? Just trying to think about the inputs there to gross margin. Thank you.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. Let me break that into two comments. Everything but Cobalt-60, and since you raised Cobalt-60, I'll come back to that. But the everything but Cobalt-60, we're seeing fluctuations but the fluctuations are relatively minor. And as you know, we have a number of oil-based products, so our chemistries are commonly oil-based and our service, we've got a lot of vehicles with our service. So we are sensitive to oil, and as you know, oil is bouncing a little bit, but it's staying, relatively speaking, in good shape. We have seen some other commodities move up a little bit, stainless steel, but again nothing of significance. And we do hedge nickel, which is the biggest component of steel – stainless steel price variation typically. The last thing you mentioned was Cobalt-60. And Cobalt-60, for all of our supply out of North America, we have long-term contracts that have prices built into them. So we do not see an unexpected increase in Cobalt-60 for a number of years anyway. And then OUS, we've not seen any significant price increase.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Congrats on a great quarter.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead with your question. Mr. Rodgers, is it possible your phone is on mute?
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Sorry about that. Yeah. Just one question. I had a question on the M&A outlook, where you're seeing the most opportunities out of your segments, and if future acquisitions in IMS are a possibility as well. Thanks.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I'd say a couple of things there. As is always, if you look at the number of deals we have done in the last six, seven, eight years, the preponderance of those have been small private businesses. And I don't see that changing. I think the preponderance will likely continue to be tuck-in type businesses. As you know, there has been a great deal of consolidation in the medical device space. And when there's a great deal of consolidation, there's often something – some components that don't fit quite as well as others. And so that would be, in my opinion, a fertile area. And then the balance is public companies. But as you know, pricing is a little heady right now in the public company space, and that's something we would want to be careful about as we look at those things. So at a high level, that's I think where we are.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is follow-up from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Mike. Just one additional question. So in your thoughts around your debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio and your comment about potentially moving down to 2 times leverage by the end of the year if there weren't any deals done. If you get there, let's say, you're at 2 times leverage or maybe even a little bit below by the end of the year, does your capital allocation priorities change or would you think differently about capital allocation?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yes, definitely, Larry. As we approach the 2 times leverage, we would definitely rethink our priorities, right? If you remember, we added debt repayment back when we acquired Synergy, when we hit 2.9 times leverage, and we wanted to make sure we focused on and signal to everybody that the repayment of debt was a priority for us. As we get lower and lower, we are internally looking at other alternatives and we would definitely have to change our mindset if we were to continue to include that or not as a priority.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And I guess just the last follow-on to that is as you look at your M&A pipeline, how does that sort of fit today versus what is considered typical for you guys?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: I wish I could tell you what typical pipeline looks like, Larry. It seems like they come in clusters and go in clusters though. I think – so the answer is I think that's difficult and I think that's what we're seeing. We see a number of things and then we don't see things and we see a number of things. And even the ones we see, they're not always as actionable as you would like, and we don't control the timing. So I don't think there's a radical change in our thinking on pipeline, but we don't have much control of the timing.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, at this time, in showing no additional questions, I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Jamie, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing many of you as we get back out on the road in the coming months.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the STERIS Plc Fourth Quarter and Year End Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Please also note that today's event is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference call over to Julie Winter, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everybody. We appreciate you taking the time to join us to go over our fourth quarter results. As usual, on today's call I have with me Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President, CFO and Treasurer.

To measure constant currency organic revenue, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that affect the comparability in trends and revenue are removed. We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles, net capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant equipment and intangibles. Additional information regarding adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow is available in today's release. Also, we will be posting supplemental tables on our website this morning that provide the product mix breakdown within our segments for your convenience. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Walt.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Thanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone. I have a bit of a spring allergy, so a little bit of a froggy voice this morning. I hope I'm not too hard to hear. As Mike will discuss shortly, we ended fiscal year 2017 strong and feel good about where we stand today and even better about where we're headed tomorrow. Fiscal 2017 was a transition year for STERIS as we took strategic actions to improve the business for the long-term. We have completed the bulk of the Synergy Health integration efforts and have divested businesses that do not fit our go forward strategy. We achieved 5% constant currency organic revenue growth in fiscal 2017, a good showing in today's market. We had a particularly strong fourth quarter ending the year on a high note. The actions we have taken have delivered results beyond revenue growth which are apparent in the expansion of both – in both gross margins and operating income margins. Overall, operating margins improved by 130 basis points in the year resulting in a record 18.2% of sales. We also achieved another double digit increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year to $3.76. I will spend a few moments on the highlights of the year for each of our segments before getting into our outlook for fiscal 2018. Starting with our largest segment, Healthcare Products revenue grew 4% on a constant currency organic basis for the year. Consumables were strong, excluding the impact of divestitures, as we benefited from continued mid-single digit growth in our instrument cleaning chemistries, double-digit growth in U.S. endoscopy and our V-PRO consumables. Equipment Service revenue continued its history of consistent growth, particularly in installation of our OR Integration offerings, and an increase in Preventive Maintenance contracts. Capital Equipment shipments started the year a bit slow, but ended very strong. For the full year, we saw particular strength in washers and steam sterilizers on the Infection Prevention side of our business, and OR Integration in our Surgical Business unit. Healthcare Specialty Services grew constant currency organic revenue 5% for the year with improving profitability in the fourth quarter. Our people in IMS have done a nice job winning new contracts during the year and as we said last quarter, we expect that portion of our business to reach high-single digit operating margin run rates by the end of fiscal 2018. Combined with the divestitures of the lower profitability businesses, our expectation is to bring the profitability of the entire segment to mid-single digits for the full year. In Applied Sterilization Technologies, revenue grew 7% for the year on a constant currency organic basis, reflecting strong underlying demand from our core medical device customers. Of course, the fall in the euro and British pound offset much of this growth outside the United States on an as-reported basis. As you all know, we have been making investments in AST to expand capacity at a number of facilities, and growth investments will continue in fiscal 2018. These are sound expansions with return on investment capital typically exceeding our cost of capital in a three to four year timeframe. However, we do not expect to see the same level of margin expansion next year for the level of growth we anticipate due to the startup costs and higher level of depreciation on these new facilities. We do not expect profit dollars to fall as a result of these investments. They just will not expand as fast as they would for the level of growth we anticipate. We look forward to significant margin expansions in FY 2019 and beyond as a result of these investments. Life Science constant currency organic revenue increased 4% led by high single-digit consumable revenue growth. We had strength in both barrier products and formulated chemistries with particular strength in Europe. Service revenue grew double-digits for the year with growth in maintenance contracts and new service offerings. Capital Equipment revenue ended the year slightly below our expectations, but with strong orders in hand. We have a double-digit percentage increase in backlog to a record $53 million, which is a good start for next year. Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2018, we expect another year of solid performance. This is our tenth year together as a team, and we have successfully delivered on our long-term commitments for growth and adjusted earnings per share over that period despite substantial challenges and headwinds along the way. Our revenue has grown 8% compounded and our adjusted earnings per share 10%. As I have said since I arrived at STERIS, I believe this is a business that can grow revenue mid- to high-single digits through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions and leverage that growth to deliver double-digit bottom line expansion. Our management team has accomplished this goal the past 10 years and I believe we will continue to do so the next 10 years. We have macro forces that will continue to help drive growth in procedures and vaccines; the Baby Boom population reaching peak health care spending ages in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, and the growing middle class outside the industrialized world. We are a recognized global leader in sterilization and decontamination, with strength in hospitals and surgery centers, pharmaceutical manufacturing of biologics and vaccines, and medical device sterilization. We also have focus on additional products and services for the procedural areas of surgery and endoscopy. In addition to revenue growth, we have plenty of opportunity to become a more efficient business using lean techniques in both our operations and our support functions. Specific to fiscal 2018, we anticipate that as reported revenue will decline 2% to 3% reflecting lost revenue of approximately $160 million from the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions. Also factored into that outlook is a $15 million degradation to revenue from foreign currency movements. Our outlook presumes that we will complete the last of our planned divestitures in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This business represents about $40 million of the total $160 million of divested revenue for the year. We have not assumed any additional acquisitions, divestitures in our FY 2018 outlook beyond those that have occurred or I've discussed. We continue to believe that there are acquisition opportunities before us, but the timing of deal completion is difficult to predict. We believe our underlying revenue growth on a constant-currency organic basis will be in the range of 4% to 5% for the year, with solid growth in all four segments driving that performance. With the benefit of cost synergies and the impact of divestitures, we expect another year of meaningful improvement in operating margins largely stemming from improvement in gross margins. As always, we plan to reinvest some of our savings. In particular, we anticipate double-digit growth in R&D spending in FY 2018 and significant capital spending for expansion opportunities. As we noted in our release, we anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $3.96 to $4.09. As we have seen in prior years, we expect our earnings to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Fiscal 2018 earnings comparisons to fiscal 2017 will be a bit light in the first half compared to prior years, as we have tougher comparisons on foreign exchange as well as the impact of lost profit dollars from divestitures. This is particularly true of the first quarter, where have the largest headwind of lost profit from divestitures. All in all, we expect 43% of our earnings to be in the first half of the fiscal year and 57% in the second half. As we look ahead we're excited about the opportunities before us. We have a great team in place, are positioned nicely for future growth, and have both breadth and depth in our core businesses with significant opportunities to grow. We will continue our mission to help our customers create a healthy and safer world. I'll turn the call over to Mike to review the quarter before we open for Q&A. Michael?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our fourth quarter adjusted financial results. We ended the year strong with total constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% in the fourth quarter driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter increased 200 basis points to 41.3%. The improvement in gross margin was due to the impact of divested businesses, favorable foreign currency, cost synergies and pricing, partially offset by product mix. EBIT margin at 20.3% of revenue for the quarter represents a 150 basis point improvement, reflecting the positive contributors to gross margin somewhat offset by an increase of 10% in R&D expenditures. We are very pleased with our continued ability to expand EBIT margins and leverage revenue growth. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 25.5%, down substantially from the prior year and slightly lower than our expectations as we had favorable discrete item adjustments in the quarter. This puts our full year fiscal 2017 effective tax rate at 25.2%. We anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 25% to 26% for the full fiscal year 2018. Net income in the quarter increased 21.5% to $94.7 million or $1.11 per diluted share benefiting from organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. Moving on to our segment results. Healthcare Products segment as reported revenue grew 5% in the quarter, while constant currency organic revenue grew 7%. Capital led the way with a revenue increase of 12% while Service revenue grew 4%. This growth was offset by a 3% decline in Consumable revenue caused by the divestiture of our Skin Care business which reduced revenue by $10 million in the quarter. Within Capital Equipment, we saw strength in our OR Integration offering, steamed sterilizers and washers during the quarter. Backlog in Healthcare Products declined $10 million to $110 million in the quarter reflecting fourth quarter strong capital equipment shipments. Healthcare Products operating income increased 24% and operating margins improved by 320 basis points to 21.2% of revenue in the quarter. The margin increase is due primarily to the increase in volume, improvement in gross margin and the impact of divestitures. Revenue for Healthcare Specialty Services increased 8% on a constant currency organic basis with strength in IMS and the legacy Synergy CSD outsourcing business in Europe. Healthcare Specialty Services operating income for the fourth quarter increased sequentially by over 150% from $2.2 million to $5.7 million on a sequential sales decline of 6%. Recall that during the quarter, we divested our remaining Linens business in the Netherlands. Applied Sterilization Technologies grew revenue 10% on a constant currency organic basis bolstered by a rebound in volume following the light December sales period. Applied Sterilization Technologies operating margin at 33.9% of revenue was down 90 basis points primarily due to the impact of foreign currency movements. We expect this FX pressure on profitability to continue into the first half of fiscal 2018. Remember that the currency decline in the euro and British pound did not significantly impact our results in this segment until the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Life Sciences as reported revenue for the quarter grew 1%. We continue to see Goods Consumable revenue growth in the quarter of 5% offset by lumpy Capital Equipment shipments which were down 2% and a decline in Service revenue of 1%. Constant currency organic revenue growth was 2% in the quarter. Our Capital Equipment orders in Life Sciences ended the quarter strong growing backlog to a record $53 million. Life Sciences fourth quarter operating margin declined 170 basis points to 29.9% due in part to increased R&D spending and unfavorable product mix within Capital Equipment revenue. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $283 million of cash, $1.48 billion in total debt and a debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of just under 2.5 times. Without additional acquisitions, we anticipate leverage by the end of fiscal year 2018 to be approximately 2 times debt-to-EBTIDA. As this happens, we will be approaching or passing our optimum level of leverage and we will likely move away from our recent emphasis on lowering our leverage ratio and instead return our focus to our traditional capital allocation priorities: maintaining and growing the dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, funding acquisitions, and share repurchases. During the quarter, we took advantage of locking in low, long-term favorable financing rates as we issued and sold approximately $300 million of fixed rate senior notes in a private placement. Substantially all of the proceeds were used to repay floating rate bank debt, thereby increasing our portion of fixed rate debt. The result was a shift from floating rate debt to somewhat higher cost fixed rate debt, which will lead to an increase in net interest expense in the coming year. In total, our current expectations for interest expense is about $46 million in fiscal 2018. Free cash flow for the year was $256 million, almost double compared to last year, primarily due to higher cash from operations, which was partially driven by a reduction in acquisition-related cash expenses. Included in free cash flow for fiscal 2017 is approximately $26 million of cash expenses related to acquisitions and divestitures. We anticipate a reduction of approximately $20 million in related cash expenses in fiscal 2018. For the full fiscal year 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately $180 million, reflecting continued facility expansions, integration of IT systems, new product development, and general maintenance for existing facilities. Total depreciation/amortization for fiscal 2018 is expected to be approximately $180 million, which includes about $65 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets. For the full fiscal year 2017, we returned approximately $190 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. The balance of cash was utilized to repay debt and to acquire several small businesses. With that, I will now turn the call over to Julie to begin Q&A. Julie?
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. Jamie, if you would please give the instructions, we can get started on Q&A.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. We'll pause momentarily to assemble the roster. And our first question today comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Morning, Larry.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Morning. Walt and/or Mike, maybe we could just start at a very high level and given some of the distractions from 2017 with the divestitures and integrating Synergy and of course some of the challenges achieving some of the top line goals, can you talk a little about philosophically how you came into 2018 and kind of what do you view driving that top and bottom end of that organic constant currency range of 4% to 5%?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Larry, I would say, in terms of the approach, first of all, obviously, some of the businesses that we divested were disappointing to us. They were not in our strategic wheelhouse anyway, and they were doing not as well as we expected. So for both short and long-term reasons, it made sense to make those divestitures and let someone else do with them something that, probably better than we could. And so that clearly impacted our last year. In terms of, I would say, forecast going forward, we forecast, as we always do and have, as we do bottom-up forecast in our business units, we also look at the top to see if it makes sense to us vis-a-vis what's going on in the marketplace and we look at those two things in concert and we put out the forecast we think is a reasonable forecast. We do, on the one hand, want to stretch our people and our operations to do the best we can. On the other hand, we obviously don't want to put forecasts out there we don't meet. If we look at it in total, I think we've done a pretty decent job of that. Last year was obviously a disappointment.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And are there any drivers for the top and bottom end of that 4% to 5% range?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: The answer is, of course, yes. The kind of the classic questions around capital, both forms of capital, Life Science and Healthcare. Life Science tends to be a little bit lumpy. This year we have more confidence going into the year in that we do see that pipeline and we have a very good backlog. So probably we're a little more comfortable than normal on that side of the business. On the Healthcare side of the business, again, this question always comes up with the pipeline out there, how are things looking particularly in the United States? So far, we have seen continuation of the trend we've been talking about for a year or two; that is it's not growing rapidly, but we continue to see a reasonable pipeline, it's up a few digits, if you will. And we have continued to see that. I would say we've seen kind of particular strength on the project side of the business; that is people who have made strategic decisions to put steel in the ground or to refurbish major parts of their facilities are continuing that at the pace that we have been seeing. And we haven't seen significant changes on the replacement side of the house as well. So it looks like a continuation of the future. As you all know, there are a lot of things up in the air right now in U.S. health care, the way it's going to be reimbursed, what happens with the Affordable Care Act, and so we're all watching that carefully. But we've not seen any indication from our hospital customers that they are pulling back on capital spending at this point. And in fact, you've seen a number of announcements by the for-profit side of the world about how they are going forward with strong capital spending.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just quickly on free cash flow, I think for 2017 you had guided to $250 million. You obviously did a little bit better, $256 million. And included in that was about $50 million of spending related to the Synergy acquisition. So I was thinking that cash flow, given the growth in the business – free cash flow, I should say, would have been $300 million or perhaps a bit better. You're guiding a little bit below that. Are there any sort of step-ups that we should be thinking about? Looks like CapEx is up a bit year-over-year.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yes, Larry, you're right. CapEx is up a little bit year-over-year. And also we are anticipating another about $20 million of cash expenses related to acquisitions and divestitures. So if you take our free cash flow, add the $20 million, we're just over that $300 million mark on a little bit of an increase in our CapEx.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joel Kaufman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, yes. Thanks for the question. Just following up on the organic growth guidance, just maybe help us walk through the process again because when I frame down the top – frame the top-down views of the market you just provided and the portfolio today relative to the portfolio when you guys provided guidance on the fourth quarter call last year, one could argue that the weighted average market growth rate of your assets today is more attractive than it was 12 months ago. Just trying to understand what brought down the outlook relative to the 7% target you guys provided last year.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Well, we agree with you. The weighted average of the current business is stronger than the weighted average of the business last year. I think it goes without saying we were obviously over aggressive in our forecast last year. We didn't meet that forecast and we did take that into account when we looked at these numbers. I would not call this an overly conservative forecast. I think it's a reasonable forecast and we intend to hit it. But clearly we were over optimistic last year. But I agree with your standpoint. If we had the same portfolio that we had last year, we would be guiding even lower than we are today.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Then just turning to the AST business, obviously the growth there has been fairly strong, coming in a little bit ahead of what I would say is sort of the contributors across the med dev device volumes were. So, can you maybe just help us understand what's driving the growth there? Is it a market share dynamic? Is it a pricing dynamic? Thanks.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure. First of all, we do get modest price increases in that business over time and those are long-term contractual increases. So we do get modest price increases; that's a small portion but the other side of that is indeed a combination of market growth. And you have to remember on the device side, devices, particularly implantable devices have been under some significant price pressure the last several years. And in that space, we count volume is what drives our business, not so much the price, the end user price of the business we're an, ever, an infinitesimal piece of their cost. So we tend to ride with volume, not with their end market prices. And I do think over time that we have picked up some share predominantly from some of the smaller players in the marketplace.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And then just last one on capital allocation. Appreciate the comments that as you guys approach the optimal leverage target, you guys are going to be thinking about getting back to a more traditional pattern of cap allocation. Is anything changed in terms of your priorities between share repurchase and smaller tuck-ins relative to what it would've been prior to the Synergy Health acquisition?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: No. I would say not at all. Those are our rank order priorities. They were before the deal and they continue to be post.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matt Mishan from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Hey, Matt.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Could you just give us a sense of the trajectory you're expecting this year and maybe into next year for like revenue growth and operating margins for specifically the Healthcare Specialty Services segment? That seems like that's been a laggard over the course of 2017 but you saw some really nice improvement last quarter. And I think it, especially in the outsource central sterile processing side you're starting to see some pretty good volumes there.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: You know, I would say there's a couple – there's different components of that. And clearly the euro/pound impacted our European business on, including currency basis. On a constant currency basis, we do see growth in that business, the traditionally European business. The – what we have historically called the IMS business, or the instrument repair portion of that business, which is largely in North America, has seen some nice growth. And you know this past year we lost a pretty significant chunk of business from a couple of customers. And as a result, our growth rate was not as high as we expected. But even with that loss we still had reasonable growth rates for the year, mid-single digit growth rates. We are toning down our view of that a little bit. When we did the acquisition, we were saying high-single to low-double digits. We think that market has matured some in this past several years, and so probably more in the mid-single to maybe a little north of a mid-single. But in that range of mid-single digits, as opposed to what we have historically said in terms of our outlook.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: And I would also add, Matt, that you know, from a profitability standpoint, the divestitures had put a lot of pressure on that segment. And you have seen, with the removal of all of our linen businesses, you're starting to see that uptick of profit in the right direction.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And in the outsource central sterile processing, since you closed on Synergy Health, have you guys opened or signed any new contracts on outsourcing centers, either here or in the U.K.? And then what does the pipeline look for that moving forward?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: The answer to the question is we have signed outsourcing contracts, both in the U.S. and the U.K. Those contracts in the U.S. have tended to be, or have all been I should say, inside the existing facility as opposed to building a center and doing what the, you know, kind of the traditional European outsource. We have also signed additional contracts, both in the U.K. and in Europe, and so we have brought contracts on board. Some of those were, as I've just described, inside the facility. Some of those were re-upping historic contracts. And some were we anticipate building some facilities or putting facilities in place or refurbishing facilities, it is going to require capital. The other one that we've obviously talked about a fair amount is Northwell. And we continue to expect that to go, but we intend – we expect that to happen next year, not this fiscal year, in any significant revenue way. We do have capital in our forecast for new facilities, a, we have capital for the Northwell facility, and we have capital for some other facilities, but we would not expect any material revenue at this point for this current year.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then last question for Mike. I think the segment margins were all pretty strong in the quarter, but in the Other line you saw a little bit of a spike there. Can you elaborate on what drove like the $7 million in costs in the Other line?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yes. Part of that was – remember, we don't allocate all of our costs across to all of the businesses. We withhold a portion of not only the Defense Industrial business but also other costs related to legacy pension, post-retirement, board expenses, Walt and my expenses. So it was just a timing issue on that. For the year we've seen a slight increase in our expenses for some of those items, especially with Synergy Health on the pension side, which we are holding at the corporate level.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much, Mike.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: You're welcome, Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Appreciate you taking the questions here this morning. Mike, maybe just if you'd go back on the backlog in Life Sciences, was a little bit intrigued by that growth, hitting that record level of $53 million. Could you just talk about what you're seeing as a backdrop there, maybe from a big picture standpoint? Historically that's been kind of a weaker spot. I realize it's lumpy, but again just kind of a little surprised to see that perk up and would like to get a little color there. And then I've got a follow-up.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Certainly. As you know, Chris, the majority of our customers in that are the pharmaceutical facilities and the research institutions. And we have continued to see very good growth coming out of the pharma side as they get back to I'll call a more normalized growth trajectory. So a large portion of our orders are coming from the pharmaceutical side. And as we continue to talk about, obviously, Life Sciences tends to be a lot more lumpy from a capital equipment shipments and when we don't ship that, it automatically falls into backlog. Their products are a lot more highly customized and a lot larger in volume. So really, a lot of it is just timing. We saw capital shipments down, but we are experiencing very good order growth rates, in particular on the pharma side.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: And Chris, I would add, we have introduced a number of new products in that space the last year or so, both on the steam sterilization side and on the hydrogen peroxide sterilization side, and particularly hydrogen peroxide I think is gaining ground in that space, so I believe that's a part of the impetus to the growth. So there's the pharma market seems – our piece of the pharma market, the vaccines, the biologics, tend to be strong and a lot of the consolidation seems to be kind of past us, if you will, in terms of plant consolidation, to the point Mike made, but we've also had some nice products to go into that space.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: That's super. And then, maybe if I could just go back to kind of a prior round of questioning, when you think about the buildup for this year's guide, candidly the top line organic growth rate looks pretty much as we had expected, but I would appreciate just some color around what you're expecting in terms of maybe domestic and global volumes, because I think that's really what I think what investors in general are trying to kind of build back up here. What do you think we'll see? Will we see a steady state type environment in terms of normal surgical procedure volume? Are you anticipating any moderation in growth? Just want to think about how we build that up through the fiscal year. Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Chris, I would say at a high level, as you know, the international volumes the last year or 18 months, have been weak relative to the U.S. volumes. And we do expect – we have seen in the Pacific Rim an increase in our business and we do expect that to continue in our forecast. Latin America has been weak. We believe we're seeing a bottoming out of that, so we may be seeing a bottom and maybe a bit of an uptick. In Europe, we've actually held nicely over this period, but the Middle East, which we put the Europe and the Middle East together, the Middle East has been down radically is the only right term, and so the European business has not been able to offset the Middle Eastern portion of that business. We, in our forecast here, we do expect growth in the European business too, so we are expecting to see better growth in the O-U.S. business than we have seen the last year or so. Now, I'm talking about the Healthcare Hospital side of the business, not Life Science and AST because they've experienced nice growth globally all during that period.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Super. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Stratton from Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead with your question.
David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review: Morning. Thanks for the question. When we look at the Healthcare Specialty Services, the improved profitability, when you break that out from the divestiture, what's the underlying profitability there and kind of the trend ongoing?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: We don't get into detail of the numbers at that level, but clearly our profitability fell in that space as we lost some business and we had invested in front of gaining what we thought was more business. And so what is going on is the cost that we've invested are catching up – as we grow the revenue, the revenue is catching up to the cost. And that's the principle improvement. We do think if we can grow the revenue as we anticipate this current year that we will see the profitability ending the year as we've described. So that's really the issue. We do not expect significant cost growth relative to the revenue growth we anticipate.
David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Thank you. And then on the Life Sciences side, I know you framed the decline in Capital Equipment sales as lumpy. And then how does that translate into the Services? Is that also lumpy? Or what kind of led that decline?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yes. Services is not as lumpy as Capital. It tends to be more stable, but there are a couple of components of Service in the Life Science space as well as the Healthcare space that are. We do a large amount of installation service and so obviously when we sell equipment, we get that installation, so if we're off in, off on the sale of the equipment, maybe in the same quarter or maybe in the next quarter, the timing differs depending on when the project was shipped and installed. But it is lumpy along with the Capital business. We also have a fair amount of business, particularly in the water stills that we sell in Europe, where they basically are refurbishing a water still and so they will get significant, and these are pretty significant orders, they'll get orders for parts that runs through our Service business. It's really a refurb, if you will, of that equipment and so our parts sometimes are lumpy because of that.
David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal from Sidoti. Please go ahead with your question.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Walt, you mentioned about increased R&D, and I was just wondering if you could give us a sense as to some of the areas you feel you need to expand upon?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Well, the short answer is we think there are some opportunities for R&D. The – couple of different issues. As our U.S. Endoscopy business grows and our ORI business grows, those businesses are more R&D intensive than some of our others. So that – those two businesses, as they grow as a overall percentage, rise – raise our overall level of R&D. The second area is when we're doing R&D projects, the end of a project has a number of expenses like prototypes and market testing and all those things where you get a spike in R&D. And we do have a number of projects that we expect to enter that phase this year. And so we will see some spike there too.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then back to Synergy, I know it's been about a year-and-a-half now since you completed the acquisition. If you had to sort of look back and grade it in terms of how it's progressed versus your expectations regarding things like the divestitures, the expected cost synergies, et cetera, what would you say?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Well, just walking through the high level, the cost reduction as a result, or cost synergies, if you will, are on track, and if anything, are better than we expected in total. The – I'll call it the strategy and market position, which is the principal reason we did it, both in the AST and the HSS side, we feel very good about that. I've been, I guess I would say on the AST side, I am more positive than I was going into it. On the HSS side, we always knew that there was going to be some – that would be a long-term revenue increase, and we still think that's a long-term revenue increase. But it is going to take time. It's a nascent business in the U.S. So, I don't feel better or worse about that. Clearly, some of the – I'll call them ancillary businesses, the businesses that neither – Synergy had always described that they would be exiting the laundry business if they could in an appropriate way, for example, but the – I'll call them the ancillary businesses that came along with the Synergy acquisition, they were not performing as well as what we had hoped. And that's why we accelerated the disposition, because we felt it made sense to – again, to put that in someone's hands who thinks it's strategic and will do a nice job with it. And that's not an area we wanted to expend resources. And, when we got into it and saw the work that we would have to do in some respects, I'll call it, for lack of better terms, the regulatory and finance work that we would need to do to handle Sarbanes-Oxley, and to handle some of the regulatory issues that we have in the U.S. that are not present in Europe, that we felt it was wise to accelerate those as opposed to spending the money to turn them into those kind of compliances and then spin – and spin them out. So we accelerated that. That was a little disappointing, but not strategic in any way.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Thanks. Very helpful. And then finally, you mentioned Europe continues to be a bright spot. I assume Brexit will be a non-issue for you there as you see it?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Well, you've got to ask Theresa May that question.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: That's a wild card.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: I would definitely not characterize Brexit as a non-issue. I will say the – there's – the plus and minus for us in terms of trade, the preponderance, particularly in the Synergy business, is local service business. So there's not a trade barrier kind of issue there because it tends to be done inside of the individual country. So that, from that standpoint, Brexit is largely a non-issue. Now the historic STERIS business, we do have facilities in France and facilities in the U.K., and we trade across boundaries, not just between the U.S. and France and Finland for that matter, but we trade across the world from those facilities. So how trade is handled between the U.K. and everybody else is not trivial to us. We care. It's not a huge piece of our business, most of our manufacturing is in the U.S. So at a high level kind of those are the answers. The real issue for us, probably bigger than anything, is currency fluctuation. And currency fluctuation is relevant to us, particularly since in those Service businesses both the cost and the revenues are in currency, if you will. And as a result the profits fluctuate directly with the currency when you translate it back to U.S. dollars. So that is relevant to us. Again, if you have a basket of currencies, if they all move in concert with the U.S. dollar, we tend to be fairly – it changes our revenues but it doesn't affect our profitability that much. But if any particular currency moves, it can have an impact.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. Again, thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we've reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. This does conclude our Fourth Quarter call, and we look forward to talking to you again in August.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Walt.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Fiscal 2017 has been a year of transition for STERIS with substantial success along the way. Following the close of the combination with Synergy Health, we made decisions about actions we wanted to take to improve the new STERIS. Some of those have been apparent to all of you and some are happening quietly behind the scenes, as we continue to work to be more efficient, deploy new systems and maximize the opportunities of the combined businesses. We've had success on several broad objectives. First, integrating the companies and achieving the $30 million to $40 million in cost synergies that we expected. I'm happy to report that most of the integration effort has gone smoothly. And by the end of this fiscal year, we will have achieved about $25 million in aggregate cost savings or about $5 million ahead of our schedule. This isn't simply a pull forward. Rather, we believe that the aggregate savings we will achieve are at least $45 million in annual cost savings by the end of fiscal year 2019, with the balance divided about evenly across the next two fiscal years. A second major objective has been to divest the legacy Synergy Linen businesses, which do not fit our business strategy, but consume valuable management focus and capital and dilute profit margins. As you know, we sold the UK Linen business early this year and we completed the disposition of the U.S. Linen business just after last quarter's earnings call. We expect to complete the final transaction to completely exit the remaining Linen business in the very near future. Improving overall operating margins was also an objective. And I'm pleased about our year-to-date 140 basis point improvement in operating margins on a company-wide basis, even with lower than expected revenue. This is a direct result of general cost improvement, cost synergies of the combination, and divestiture of lower margin businesses. We anticipate continued improvement in the fourth quarter. While the divestitures we have completed reduced the rate of reported revenue increase in the short-term, we are not giving up much in terms of operating profit. Indeed, by the end of the fiscal year, we target completion of divestitures that reduce annualized revenue by approximately $280 million, but annualized earnings per diluted share of only about $0.10. We have already completed acquisitions this fiscal year that will offset an estimated $0.08 of the decline in annualized earnings per share, but add only $30 million of annualized revenue. Obviously, this improves operating margins and it also reduces capital demands with only about a $0.02 net reduction in annualized EPS. Finally, we have had success increasing our cash flow and reducing our debt. We do not believe that the current historic low interest rates will last forever. So we have also fixed the interest rates on a larger portion of our debt and intend to pay off more of the floating rate debt as we reduce our overall leverage. We believe that the cash we are generating, along with our strong balance sheet, will give us considerable flexibility to promote shareholder value through funding our organic growth and acquisitions, reducing our leverage, and being able to continue to return cash to shareholders. Turning now to the results of our operations so far this year. Looking at our segments on a year-to-date, constant currency, organic revenue basis, all four segments have delivered low to mid single-digit revenue growth, even though capital equipment shipments have been flat in both Healthcare Products and Life Science. While we have shifted our revenue base more towards recurring revenue, we're not completely immune to market timing fluctuations, including the timing of holiday shutdowns and inventory management by our customers. We believe both of these factors negatively impacted our performance in the third quarter more than normal in our consumable franchises as well as in the AST segment. We were about on forecast with these businesses in the quarter until the month of December, when our recurring revenues became softer than we expected. Our consumables and AST revenues in January suggest this was timing as we appear to be back on our planned run rate levels. Although we had solid constant currency revenue growth across our segments in general, clearly, we had pockets of the business we anticipated would be stronger this year. I will spend some time on those before moving on to our outlook. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we have seen a shift towards large project orders for capital equipment in our Healthcare Products segment, which has increased our backlog compared to prior years, especially in the first half of this fiscal year. This shifted our shipment patterns somewhat from quick-turn replacement orders to longer lead-time project orders, which had the effect of reducing shipments and increasing backlog on a relative basis. That pattern reversed somewhat in the third quarter, as we shipped a number of the large projects that were in backlog and saw replacement type orders return to normal levels. We've also experienced continued strength in our North American capital equipment business offset weakness in most of O-U.S. markets. The rest of the Healthcare Product business is having a good year in total, with consumable revenue growth of 7% and service revenue growth of 4% on a constant currency organic basis. We planned on the stronger growth in our Healthcare Specialty Service segment from both a top and bottom line perspective this year. There are several issues at play here. As we have discussed all year, our IMS business got off to a slower start than anticipated and their cost structure a bit upside down, having hired both field and infrastructure personnel in anticipation of stronger growth than has occurred this year. The loss of business that we experienced early in the fiscal year has impacted our ability to grow above market, until we anniversary that loss early in fiscal 2018. We have been successful at winning new business, which has allowed us to maintain mid single-digit revenue growth in line with the overall healthcare market. In addition, we believe we have bottomed out our profitability decline, as our growth is catching up with our spending, and are beginning to turn upward. We expect to exit fiscal year 2018 at a high single-digit operating margin run rate. We also experienced under performance in parts of the legacy Synergy business in this segment, primarily from three areas, the Linen business globally, the outsourced processing business for Sterilmed, and the U.S. outsourced instrument processing business. As we've already discussed, we have successfully exited two of the Linen businesses and expect to exit the final one this year. We've also worked with Sterilmed to improve the profitability of that unit going forward. And we've integrated the legacy U.S. Synergy and STERIS IMS instrument processing business. As a result, we anticipate improved profitability going forward, even as we continue to invest in the nascent CSD outsourcing opportunity in the United States. I will emphasize that the legacy Synergy outsourced CSD business in Europe is meeting our performance expectations on a constant currency basis. But it is soft as reported due to the weaker euro and pound when translated to dollars. The AST segment continues to grow revenue nicely on a constant currency organic basis. And we're making good progress on our expansion plans. We expect that some of the capital expenditures we thought we would spend this year in this segment will fall into fiscal 2018. And we've adjusted our outlook for CapEx as a result. This is simply the timing of construction expenses, as we have seen modest delays in our expected timelines with our facility expansions in New York, California, and Europe. We continue to believe the intermediate to long-term results of the Synergy-STERIS-AST combination will exceed our original expectations on a constant currency basis. But once again, the weaker euro and pound have had a negative impact on our European business as reported in dollars. We are also continuing above market growth in our Life Science segment with double digit constant currency organic revenue growth in consumables in both our formulated chemistries business as well as our barrier protection products. On the service side we have new offerings enhancing our performance issues with underlying growth in the low single digits. As you know the capital equipment revenue in Life Science is lumpy. And our first three quarters reflect that. Our growth was very strong in Q1, solid in Q2, and we retracted significantly in Q3. We are expecting a strong Q4 to finish the year. And our increased backlog supports that view. From an overall profitability perspective the operating margin for Synergy improvement we generated in the third quarter demonstrates the success we are seeing in implementing our strategies. On a year-to-date basis our operating margins as a percent of revenues have improved 140 basis points to 17.5%. We anticipate higher profitability in the fourth quarter. There is no doubt that our businesses are broader in product scope and international exposure than they were just a few years ago. We have substantially improved opportunities by utilizing our strong balance sheet and cash flow to invest for growth both internally and through acquisitions. We are a more global business and as such, foreign currency exchange movements have a greater impact on our revenue. At the same time, we have a more balanced global portfolio, which helps to mitigate currency impact on the bottom line. Our most recent quarter reflected the substantial puts and takes from acquisitions and divestitures, as well as a $10 million currency headwind in revenue. That noise will increase in the fourth quarter, as we expect $40 million in revenue reduction compared to the prior year quarter, strictly due to divestitures. We also expect to see a reduction in our as reported revenue due to the impact of foreign currency with close to $20 million in headwinds in the fourth quarter alone. All of this will result in a decline in reported GAAP revenue, even though constant currency organic revenue growth will be in the mid-single digits. Given our performance year to date, we are taking a more conservative approach to our revenue outlook and reducing our full year anticipated constant currency organic growth rate to 4% with revenue growth in all four of our segments. When we look at our total company outlook of 17% growth, we have an additional headwind from currency of about $10 million compared with our last outlook. This will result in a total of approximately $35 million in revenue headwinds from currency for the full fiscal year. Our full year adjusted earnings per diluted share are now anticipated to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.76, reflecting the lower than anticipated performance in the third quarter and a somewhat higher effective tax rate of about 26% for the full year. As we've discussed in the past, our tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic mix of our profit, now that we're on a regional tax system. Our U.S. business has continued to outperform our business in the rest of the world, particularly when the impact of currency is included. And as you know, the U.S. currently has the highest tax rate in the world. In terms of next year I want to remind you again that we have completed a number of divestitures over the course of this year. And we are working to complete a couple more, if we can come to agreement on appropriate terms. If the divestitures occur in the timeframe we anticipate, it will have negligible impact on reported profit versus our revised guidance for FY 2017. And about a $15 million to $20 million reduction in reported revenue from our revised FY 2017 revenue outlook. Assuming we are successful with these divestitures, we will have substantially completed our efforts to rationalize the business from the combination of STERIS and Synergy Health. Due to the timing of our acquisitions and divestitures, we would expect that revenue would be reduced by approximately $150 million in net impact in FY 2018 with negligible impact to earnings on a year-over-year basis. We recognize that these divestitures and acquisitions create noise in comparisons to the previous year in our ongoing forward results. We are committed to transparency and have added increased disclosures in the press release tables to assist you in an analysis of these changes. We will continue to provide this analysis as we complete these deals going forward. In closing, we are pleased with the progress we have made this year, even though we are disappointed to be below our original revenue and profit expectations. The integration of the businesses, the divestiture of those that do not fit our strategy, significant refinancing to lock in low interest rates, combined with the complexities of Brexit, currency headwinds, difficulties in international markets, and potential changes in the healthcare and taxation landscape in the U.S. have been a lot to digest. With all that we are growing in line with market and better positioned for the long term. The core businesses of both STERIS and Synergy are strong and performing well. I think that's an important point. The core businesses of both STERIS and Synergy are strong and performing well. The divestitures we have made were below market growers and carried lower than average margins and in certain cases were operating at a loss. Those divestitures will help our growth and profitability profile going forward and allow management to concentrate on the businesses that fit our strategy. The nascent opportunity of our HHS segment in the United States is still a work in progress, but we believe it will perform over time. We appreciate the patience from our long term investors, who have seen us improve profit performance before, as we improved our legacy Healthcare, Life Science, and Isomedix segments a few years ago. We fully intend to do it again. We've created a company that is clearly in a leadership position in sterilization and disinfection and in the procedural areas of healthcare. We've balanced revenue across hospital and other procedural care center, pharmaceutical, and medical device customers. We are more balanced across capital equipment, consumables, and service. We are more global. And we are better focused on the growth areas of healthcare: procedures, medical devices, vaccines, and biologics. We are poised to execute with this stronger portfolio and optimistic about what lies ahead. We thank all of you for your continuing support. With that I will turn the call over to Mike to review our third quarter financials in more detail. Michael?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our third quarter adjusted financial results. Our third quarter total revenue grew 5%. Growth was driven by 3% constant currency organic revenue growth plus the positive revenue contribution from acquisitions. Offsetting that growth was 170 basis point headwind from currency, the largest impact we have seen this year. Organic revenue growth was entirely driven by volume, as price was unfavorable by 40 basis points in the quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter increased by 80 basis points to 40.1%. Gross margin was favorably impacted by a 140 basis point improvement coming from the divestitures, 60 basis points due to foreign currency, 30 basis points from the suspension of the medical device excise tax, and 10 basis points from other items. As discussed in previous quarters, these favorable items were offset by 160 basis points due to the impact of the accounting policy changes we had made for the legacy Synergy Health business, which will be fully anniversaried going forward. We are pleased with our ability to continue to leverage revenue growth and expand EBIT margins. EBIT margin at 19.4% of revenue represents a 200 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. EBIT margin benefited from the impact of the positive contributors to gross margin, as well as lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue, including a favorable foreign currency impact of about $1 million. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.6%, up substantially from the prior year, as last year we benefited from favorable discrete item adjustments. The actual third quarter effective tax rate is higher than our expectations due to a greater percentage of our income being earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions, primarily in the United States. We are now at 25% effective tax rate through the first nine months, but we do anticipate a continued income shift to higher tax rate jurisdictions to occur in the fourth quarter. Net income in the quarter increased 10% to $84 million. Taking into consideration the higher share count versus last year, earnings per diluted share were flat at $0.98. Moving on to the segment results. Please note that my comments regarding revenue growth are all on a constant currency organic basis, all of which you can find in our press release tables. Healthcare Products segment revenue grew 4% in the quarter, driven by growth across the business. Service revenue increased 5%, capital equipment revenue grew 4%, and consumable revenue grew 3%. Within capital equipment we saw strength in our OR integration offering and washers during the quarter. Reflecting continued strength in new orders, backlog in Healthcare Products increased 4% to $150 million in the quarter and was led by growth in infection prevention products. Healthcare Products operating income increased 25% and operating margins improved 370 basis points to a record 20.2% of revenue in the quarter. The margin increase is due primarily to operational efficiencies, favorable foreign currency, the suspension of the medical device excise tax, and the positive impact of both acquisitions and divestitures. Revenue for Healthcare Specialty Services increased 3% in the quarter, reflecting 4% revenue growth at IMS and mid-teens revenue growth from the legacy Synergy CSD outsourcing business in Europe. This growth was offset by lower growth coming from legacy Synergy Linen and Sterilmed businesses. Healthcare Specialty Services margin for the quarter were at 1.7%, a decrease from the prior year due to the declines within the legacy Synergy Linen and Sterilmed businesses, as well as lower than anticipated performance in IMS offset by favorable margin improvement from divestitures. Applied Sterilization Technologies had a good quarter, growing revenue 6% with strength across all geographies. Applied Sterilization Technologies operating margin increased to 33.1% of revenue, due primarily to the increase in volume and cost savings from the combination with Synergy. Life Sciences revenue for the quarter declined 6%, as consumable revenue grew 5% and service revenue grew 2%. This growth in consumable and service revenue was more than offset by the lumpy capital equipment shipments, which were down 27% in the quarter. Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $47 million, up 4%. Despite the decline in revenue, Life Sciences third quarter operating margin improved 140 basis points to 30.6% of revenue, in part due to favorable product mix and disciplined expense control. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $264.9 million of cash, approximately $1.5 billion in total debt, and a debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 2.5 times. We recently announced the signing of a new multi-currency private placement agreement totaling approximately $296 million. The new private placement notes will fund on February 27 and the proceeds will be used to repay floating rate bank debt, thereby increasing the company's portion of fixed rate debt. The new notes will have a weighted average maturity of about 11.8 years with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3%. This transaction by no means impacts our expectations of reducing our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to be more consistent with historic levels. With the anniversary of the combination with Synergy, our DSO is now normalized. DSO at quarter end was 59 days, consistent with historic levels. Free cash flow for the first nine months was $182 million, a substantial increase versus last year, primarily due to higher net income and a reduction in acquisition-related expenses. Included in year-to-date free cash flow is about $11 million of cash expenses related to the integration of acquisitions. During the quarter, we repurchased about $30 million in stock at an average price of $68.18. In total, we have repurchased approximately $88 million of stock to offset dilution, acquiring just over 1.2 million shares this fiscal year. Capital spending was $38.4 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $31.4 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was approximately $20 million lower due to the cumulative impact of the finalization of the purchase price allocation adjustment for the Synergy Health transaction. Also, during the quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $58.4 million, as we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment, which concluded that the carrying value of the Linen management business exceeded its fair value. The impairment charge is excluded from our adjusted financial results. With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to open it up for Q&A. Julie?
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. Mae, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started with Q&A?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Mr. Chris Cooley with Stephens. Your line is open.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. And I appreciate you taking the questions. Can you hear me okay?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Chris. Good morning.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Walt. Appreciate your prepared commentary this morning and congratulations. You guys have done a Herculean effort here, basically taking a lot of costs out of the model, getting much better leverage, and integrating the Synergy transaction in a difficult environment, all to be commended. Could you just help us, maybe to start, maybe better understand some of the vagaries that you're having to deal with in terms of just looking at the consumable portion of your business? Clearly, there was some variability there versus, I think, Street expectations. And just maybe better help us understand what you saw during, I guess, November, December and now obviously improving in – it sounds like here in the first part of the calendar 2018. Just help us better understand maybe some of those, the backdrop there, and then how you addressed that? Then, I've got a couple of quick follow-ups.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yes, Chris, you are absolutely correct. And I would say it's not just consumables. Our recurring revenue businesses all were below our expectations in the back half of December, and basically even in the beginning of December looked kind of normal. Back half of December was very weak. And so when I say recurring, I'm including the consumables on both Healthcare, Life Science and the AST business. What we did see, a number of things. And we did see more of our customers on the Life Science and medical device side taking a bit longer shutdowns in some of their plants, which is typical in the Christmas time, both for maintenance and for holiday. So we saw more of that than we're accustomed to. And then, we just saw some weakened orders, if you will, orders and shipments, because those tend to be fast turnaround shipments in both Healthcare and the Life Science space in the month of December. November was actually quite strong, just the opposite. So I'll skip the November conversation, because everything I'm saying about December is exactly the opposite of November. November was quite strong. So we were basically on our forecast at the end of November and then we just saw a slowdown across the board, across all segments of our business on the recurring revenue side, consumables and recurring revenue. Now, we have seen – now, we're in the fifth week of the calendar year and we have seen all of those come back to normal levels. So we are encouraged that one of two things has occurred. Either it was a one-time adjustment in inventories of our distributors, our customers, or the manufacturers of medical devices; or it was just a timing question, and they're actually going to bring back that revenue over the next couple of months. We are taking I would characterize it as the more conservative view. That we are using – we have placed our consumables and recurring revenue, AST and Life Science and Healthcare Consumables on our planned rates, the rate we expect to see. If there is a bounce back, there is some plus to that. But we think given that we don't know for sure the answer to that question, taking the conservative view that it was a one time, I'll call it, inventory adjustment is the better approach.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. And then maybe just two quick follow-ups from me, then I'll get back in queue. I guess continuing to kind of press on the top line a bit, unfortunately, this is the third consecutive quarter – and I realize you give annual guidance, but the third consecutive quarter where there's been some softness versus Street expectations. And again, fully appreciate the number of moving parts that are associated with this. But is there anything new that the Synergy acquisition has presented or is there a need internally to maybe alter the way you look at forecasting going forward such that maybe greater visibility into kind of what those top line growth rates may or may not be, because we're really looking at about a 30% reduction here at 4%, which is still healthy, but not quite I think what the Street was assuming from the combined entity of STERIS and Synergy? And again, I fully understand there's been a number of divestitures and FX headwinds. And then, I guess, the other part of it is, just when we think about the tax rate, fully appreciate again there that the U.S. is also the highest effective tax rate, in the U.S, but how do we think about tax policy going forward in this – that 25%-ish bogey that you guys had out there originally? Is that – should we still be thinking about that longer term or should we be thinking about rates creeping up more towards the upper 20s%, 30% rate? Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure, Chris. Let me – I'll take those questions in sequence. And then ask if Mike has any more comment on the tax. But it is obvious that we were overly bullish at the first of the year in terms of our growth rate, and that's just full stop. We were overly bullish. And so the Street's expectations were set by us. We made an error there. And we are clearly moving to a more conservative view. So I would guess that's the short answer. In terms of the fundamental businesses and particularly the core businesses, we don't feel any differently about those than we have in the past. And we also don't feel any differently about the fundamental growth rates of the business. We like the positions we're in. We like the markets we're in. We like those spaces. And we believe those to be slightly better than the – I'll call it the general market for healthcare. Because we like the procedural space; the device space, which really follows procedures; and the pharma space that we happen to be in. So we think we have solid market type growth rates ahead of us. We anticipate picking up a little bit more through a combination of product development and acquisition. And we expect our bottom line to still be in the double digit range. So we don't feel any differently about our long term. And I will say even though we're not having the year we had hoped to have, we're still going to be at double digit profitability kind of growth rates and market or above market revenue growth rates. So our biggest relative issue is we agreed that we were more bullish than it turned out we are going to be this year. But if you look at our long term history and how this reflects on our long term history, we don't feel any differently about the core Synergy businesses, the AST business, and the HHS business in Europe, the core STERIS businesses, the Healthcare Products business, the Life Science business, and the AST business. So those we feel strongly about. The HHS business, we have – in the U.S. now. The HHS U.S. business we have felt would be a longer term nascent business that we could grow. And clearly the IMS business, we get this revenue surprise, which also created a profit surprise. But again the long term perspective of that business we still see as positive, above market growth rates. And we believe we can bring that back to the kind of profitability we've talked about, the high single digit kind of profitability, low double digit over a longer time. So at the highest level we don't feel differently about the business. Now there were some pieces of the business at Synergy that, when we acquired it, we weren't 100% sure what we were going to do or not going to do, particularly the Linen business. We've talked about that at great lengths. I mean Synergy was not considering that a core part of their business. They were quite open about that. We felt exactly the same way. As we looked at it, we felt even more strongly I suppose. And those businesses have not performed all that well, below our expectation clearly. And so exiting those we see as the right thing to do. I think that answers the first question. The second in terms of tax rate. We are going to have more variability in tax rate, because we've moved from a global system to a regional system. And global system, it used to be pretty easy, because whatever the U.S. tax rate was, that was our tax rate in a – minus some discrete item adjustments or some opportunities that we had because of acquisitions. But generally speaking, it was the U.S. tax rate. Now it is the blended rates of those various countries. Again to be clear, the general reduction in tax, which is a fixed number reduction as a result of doing the Synergy acquisition, we have seen that and we continue to see that reduction on a dollar basis. So there has been no change in that. It is the variable component. The variable component is what tax rates – or what countries you make profitability in and what their resulting tax rates are. In general we see a movement toward lower tax rates around the globe. Again that's the conversations among politicians today. How that will specifically work out, we're not clear. But we don't see a reason to think that we'll be out of that mid-level tax rates at the current income tax regimes that we have in place. Now there's a lot of things being talked about. And I think it's way too early to try to forecast what – first, you have to know what they intend to do. And then you have to know how they intend to transition to that spot or those spots. And it's too early for us to comment on that. But in the current tax regimes, we feel that that 25%-ish is the right place, mid-20s% is the right place, not back to the 30% rate. And the bulk of the differential there is the reduction of our sold business outside the U.S. Again, we have been strong inside the U.S. and weaker outside the U.S. That's been a long term trend for us and the market. And then secondly, the translation of the Synergy business in O-U.S., which has been quite strong, both in AST and HHS. But when you translate it in currencies that had fallen 30%, it translated to a much smaller number. So the taxes are impacted, as you would expect. I don't know, Mike, if you have any other comment there?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. No, I would just agree with you that we are achieving the full benefits from the Synergy Health combination as Walt has outlined. Just like to add that we have and we will continue to focus on additional tax planning strategies and opportunities as we go forward. As Walt said, there is some uncertainty and that does cause us a little bit of a delay in some of those tax planning strategies. But overall, I agree with Walt. The mid-20s% is about where we expect to be.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks so much. Appreciate all the color.
Operator: Our next question is from Mr. Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, good morning.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Morning.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, Walt, I want to just pick up a little bit on the top line growth rates. You started out the year with sort of legacy STERIS organic growth of 7%. We've kind of walked down now for the entire company – now that you've got Synergy in the organic growth rate for two months this quarter and the full fourth quarter – to about 4%. So I guess just in broad brushstrokes or a high level, how do you think about the longer term growth of the business, given the markets that you're in. Is it right to think about this perhaps as more of a 4% to 5% grower? And really not think about it as a 6% or 6%-plus grower going forward?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Larry, I think we haven't changed our long term view, even during this process, even though we had a short term variation. But the long term view we have and have had and continue to have is that we have – we're in a market that generally is a mid-single digit kind of growth market. That's called healthcare in general. And we're pretty broadly across healthcare. But that we tend to be focused more in some of the more rapidly growing areas. And I believe that could give us a half a point or a point. And then we intend to do things to grow a little faster than that. So we still view this business, our targets or our objectives, and we think they're reasonable objectives, is to be in that mid to upper if you will single digit growth rate. Something in that 4% to – or 5% to 7% range kind of numbers. That's what we have said and continue to believe. And then if we do some acquisition that gets us more into that 7%, 8% acquisition – or overall growth rates. And that we should grow our profitability faster. So that gets us in double digits. And we have not wavered from that. There were people that viewed that Synergy would change that trajectory. We have never said that. We've said that we'd run a larger business out. And then we believe we can continue that trajectory that we set – have set for a number of years and we intend to continue to do. So we don't see a variance from that in the long term. Now we were more bullish in this short term period, no question. And that has not turned out to be the case. But we don't see that being a reflection of the long term position of the business. And as we've refocused on the businesses that we view are strategic business, we feel more strongly about it.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. That's helpful color. Two other questions for you. I guess the other sort of longer term view question is, I think you've generally targeted sort of 50 basis points to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion on an annual basis. Again just through all the initiatives that you guys have been putting into place. And that would be on top of synergies certainly coming out of the Synergy acquisition. So again are there still – despite all the positive moves that you made this year, are there still opportunities to drive profitability higher? And kind of is that 50 basis point to 100 basis point of operating margin expansion still the right way to think about it? And then the other question – I'll just ask it – is, is there any way that you can help us bridge the revised 2017 EPS guidance from the prior $3.85 to $4 number in helping us think about what FX did there? What the higher tax rate did? Any of the changes in timing, the more conservative outlook that you've taken here would be helpful?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. Get the two questions really separated. First is on operating efficiencies. Larry, as you know I tend to not describe operating efficiencies in percentages but in dollars first. And I don't – we go after dollars, so that happens to result in percentages. But we go after dollars. And we absolutely do not believe we have come to the bottom of the well of improvement opportunities. We think we have significant improvement opportunities going forward. Secondly, as we achieve those opportunities we do not always take them all to the bottom line. Sometimes we put them back in holding prices. And as a result, we think that makes us stronger in terms of our ability to hold or gain share. So we do not put all those efficiencies in the bottom line. But you are correct. We have a habit, generally speaking, of you put all that together either by growing revenue and having a relatively fixed base cost. Or by bringing those variable efficiencies to the bottom line or some portion of them, we have tended to raise profitability. And we have units that clearly need more work there. And we have units that are doing very nicely there. But we expect all of them to work to improve their efficiency. And we don't think we're anywhere near. And I would add a couple of things there. I guess is first of all, in-sourcing and on-shoring is becoming an interesting fad these days. It's a fad that we started doing seven years, eight years ago. We fully intend to continue to do that. And so – and we believe we have gained significant efficiencies in doing that. At the same time creating some nice employment in the United States. At the time we started this we had 3,200, 3,300 people in the U.S. On a constant basis without acquisition we know we've grown 700 or 800 people, jobs if you will, because we have in-sourced and on-shored those types of things. And secondly, through the acquisitions we now have about 7,000 people in the United States. And we know that we have saved jobs in the U.S. by doing that. Turns out that looks like a good thing to have done. We thought it was a good thing to do, because it's good basic business. But we think it's a good thing too.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. And then, Larry, on the reconciliation to help you versus – EPS versus our prior outlook, it's actually two components. About a third of that reconciliation is due to the higher tax rate. And then about two-thirds is really due to the underperformance that we're ending Q3 that as Walt talked about, we do not believe we will make that up in the full year. Although we will have a good fourth quarter, but not good enough to make up that shortfall. So that's the two components to help you with the reconciliation.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much, guys.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: You're welcome.
Operator: Next question is from Mr. Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Yes. Wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the IMS business? Why that has underperformed versus your expectations in the quarter? And your plans going forward for that business?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure. Well, we've talked about it over the course of the year. But it has not picked up as much as we would have hoped. That is, we lost some significant amount of business early in the year. And we – basically there was a contract, a dual contract with one of our larger customers. And that contract changed. We still have a dual contract. So we still do business with that customer. But a more significant portion of it – when it was first done we thought there would be significant losses this last fiscal year. Turned out not to be the case. So we were – we did better than we expected last fiscal year. And then we expected significant growth this year on top of that. What happened is we lost business. We've still grown. But the net effect of that has been about a 4% constant currency growth rate. Having that would be fine, if we hadn't thought it was going to be 10%. That's not the right exact number, but it's close to the right exact number. And so we thought it was going to be more a like double-digits. So we invested ahead of that, which you need to do in service, because you have to train people, get things up to speed. You can't take business if you can't perform it in a service business. And so we had beefed up our costs in order to be able to perform that double-digit growth increase and we have not seen it. We believe that business has continued to grow. We believe it will continue to grow. So we don't want to turn around and lay off people who we will need in our future after we spent money and time and effort training them and putting them in place. So we're keeping that infrastructure in place and we will grow our way back to the levels of profitability we expect. At a high level, that's the conversation. It has taken us longer than we expected. And we've said that we expect the outgoing rate to get back to kind of our normalized levels at the end of next year. Our original thinking was it would be more like the end of this year or first part of next year. So it has taken longer than we expected, but we fully intend to do it. And in terms of the future, we like the business. We think it is a good business. We think it fits very nicely strategically with the Synergy HSS business and we intend to move both of them across the pond. That is, more of the IMS business over to the European areas and more of the HSS business to the U.S. And we think that is a long-term good thing to do. It's just going to take time.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: And back in November, you talked about some improvement in hospital spending internationally. Is that still the case?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I wouldn't characterize it as a whole lot different and still the improvement is from a not such good level, is the short answer. But we have seen Europe specifically has not – or has kind of held steady. Now, EMEA, Middle East has still continued to be very difficult. And so big drops there, but we seem to have kind of bottomed out. Latin America, again, we seem to have kind of bottom out. We haven't seen big increases, but we're – the falling has seemed to stop. And then our Pacific business actually seems to be picking up. So we do feel a bit better about it in that it's not continuing to fall, but the currencies have continued to slide, and which – when the euro and the pound fall 10% versus the U.S. dollar, it makes it more difficult to sell that product overseas, and even what you do sell is at a lower price and lower profit typically. So that has – the actual business environment in those nations I think have improved, but the currency issues make it harder. And when we talk about the effect of currency on profitability, the piece that doesn't get picked up in, I'll call it, the accounting ledger is the business you don't get anymore, because your costs and prices have gone up. So it's still – currency has clearly put pressure on our O-U.S. business.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: And then just a few housekeeping items. With the new notes, what percent of your debt overall is fixed? And what is the new CapEx number that you have for fiscal 2017? Thank you.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Jason. For breakout between fixed and floating, we are moving from – and I'm going to do this on a pro forma basis, as if the funding would have occurred at the end of December. At the end of December, we were at a 44% fixed, 56% floating. With the new multi-currency private placement funding, that will move us to 63% fixed and 37% floating. And then, from a capital expenditure standpoint, we have lowered that a little bit. We are thinking it's now more in the $170 million range versus the $190 million range. And the bulk of that is what Walt talked about. Our AST projects have just slowed down a little bit. We ran into some issues. And that is just going to move into next year. We will spend it. It's just going to cross fiscal years.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: But the issues are not, I would call it, significant operational issues. They are getting licenses and getting permits that, I'll call it, the not so unusual things that happen when you're trying to bring new facilities or expand facilities. So it's modest timing change, not anything that significant.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Normal construction delays.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Thank you very much.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question is from Mr. Mitra Ramgopal of Sidoti. Your line is open.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Walt, if you could talk to the mix you're seeing in terms of the large project orders versus the replacement? And based on the new administration in Washington, are you getting a sense from customers in terms of capital spending, if they're taking a wait-and-see approach in terms of healthcare reform? Or is it still no change from your standpoint?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure. The mix question of large projects versus replacement is an ongoing moving target. And we think of our traditional mix of roughly two-thirds replacement and one-third project, but it runs as high as 70% or 75% replacement at times and as low as 50%, 60% at some times. 50% would be a low number, but 60% would be not unusual. And Project orders tend to be lumpy and replacement orders tend not to be. So there is some movement in that, but we had seen a fairly strong temporal trend toward project the last 9 months to 12 months. This quarter happened to be balanced at almost exactly our rates. Our incoming orders were one-third/two-thirds almost on the number. And since we shipped some large projects and those came in, we've moved back toward a more normalized level of replacement orders. Those tend to ship more quickly, which is one of the reasons we feel the fourth quarter will be strong. And then in terms of the go-forward question on CapEx, all of our leading indicators look steady. And so we have not at this time seen any significant "wait and see", but there's a lot of turmoil in Washington these days. We will see how that turmoil works out. But at this point in time, our leading indicators do not suggest a pullback.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then quickly on the divestitures, I know you said there's one piece of the Linen business left and then maybe a couple more you might be looking to do this year. Do you think as we finish out 2017, the divestitures and sort of being with the businesses you want to keep should be behind you and maybe you might start looking at some tuck-ins going forward, Or also the use of cash, is it going to be more towards you doing some share buybacks, early debt reduction is a priority, essentially keep raising the dividend? If you can just give us a sense of how you're thinking in terms of the cash you're generating in deployment?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure. On the first question, I hope I was clear. I think if what we think is going to happen in this quarter happens, we will be finished with the – there's always going to be some little divesture here or there. But with the work that we anticipated doing with Synergy, we should be finished with that. So we would hope that's behind us and finished. On the capital allocation we do not have any change of view on capital allocation. Again we don't tend to change our dividend policy. So that's the first point. The second point is we fully intend to fund organic growth in the business, because that's the safest and surest growth to continue to generate high ROICs. The next piece, we look at tuck-in type acquisitions. We have continued to look, and we've actually done some, even this past year, while we were doing those other things. And then we intend to continue to pay down debt till we get to what we consider our more normal levels. And then finally if there is other significant potential cash available, we would consider buyback. So that is our – that has been for some time now, since we did the Synergy deal, that's been our approach. And we haven't change that view.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Thanks. And just to clarify, the one divestiture remaining that you hope to finish soon, is that already factored into revised guidance?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. We mentioned that in the comments. And just to point out, if it occurs in this year, the revised revenue guidance will fall slightly. And we gave the numbers earlier, $15 million to $20 million the top line, and then the bottom line should have no significant effect.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks again.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: You bet.
Operator: Next question is from Mr. Matt Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. And thank you for taking the questions and squeezing me in. Hey, Walt, I just want to make sure I – like I fully understand what the organic growth expectation is for the fourth quarter. I think you did a really nice job of outlining what the divestiture composition was, what the FX composition was. But the organic growth, are you expecting that to kind of accelerate in the fourth quarter from where you've been? And I'm just trying to get a sense for it. And then why not be a little bit more conservative around North America Healthcare capital equipment, given customers could very easily delay orders out of the first quarter, given uncertainty?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. By definition it has to pick up a little bit to get to the 4% growth rate, but it is just a little bit. And we think we are being conservative kind of across the board in terms of our views, largely over the consumable things we talked about earlier, recurring revenue things we talked about earlier. We have not seen delays. You are correct, it could happen. But nothing in our current window suggests that we're going to see that. So at this point in time we're holding with the forecast. It is essentially the forecast we expected for the year. And it is clearly more North – it's we have more North America and less O-U.S. But other than that it's essentially the forecast that we expected. And the backlog is sitting there to – for the bulk of it to ship. We do not historically see cancellations in the backlog. That is a – I mean it happens upon a rare, rare occasion. We do sometimes see push outs. But cancellations are really, really, unusual.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then on Healthcare Specialty Services. First, can you give us an update on where Northwell is at? And then second, could you – I believe you said you feel like you can get that business to high single digit operating margins by the end of FY 2018. Could you give us a sense of how you get there? And just kind of walk us there?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I mean I was specifically talking about the – I'll call the IMS piece of that business, which we – where we've seen declines. And we expect to get that IMS piece back to that high single digit. The balance of that business we're, I mean, changing significantly by exiting the Linen business. But partially that will depend on the investments we continue to make or we make to work to grow that pace of business. So that one we're not doing a forecast per se. Now coming back to the Northwell question. Northwell has – as you know has been delayed for building purposes. They continue to be delayed. And so that is not something we will see revenue on the near to intermediate term. I do not expect to see revenue in the next fiscal year for the Northwell.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: Next question is from Mr. Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Just two quick ones. First, while you certainly mentioned Sterilmed and working to improve that, could you just again review what's been going on there? And what you are doing to improve that relationship and agreement? And then the other question is just since you're using forward rates, what are the assumptions for the euro, peso, and Canadian dollar, and I guess pound?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure. I'll address the Sterilmed question. We have been working with Sterilmed. We're in essence a contract reprocessor for the Sterilmed business. And there have been a number of changes in that businesses as we have moved forward. And so we worked with Sterilmed to do a couple things. Find ways to improve the cost structure of the business, working together and sharing the results of that – of those savings. So we do expect to see our profitability in that business improve significantly the next little bit. So that's the answer to the first question. The second...
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: I'll give the rates. So for the outlook for the quarter using December 31 forward looking rates. We anticipate that all four of the major currencies that we track and follow and that impact us will have further declines. So we have the Canadian dollar at $0.74. We have the euro at $1.06. We have the peso at $0.047 and the pound at $1.24. So all four of those are continuing to slide versus where we were in the third quarter.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, Mike.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: You are welcome.
Operator: Next question is from Joel Kaufman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Joel.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Could you maybe just parse out what's driving the continued strength we're seeing at AST? And growth trends from your customers would suggest that the market growth rate there continues to be pretty robust. Just trying to figure out if there's any market share dynamics happening behind the scenes?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: I wouldn't characterize a significant market share change. We do think two things. We work to continue to convince some customers that they would be better served to outsource that work, as opposed to do it themselves. And we have seen a little bit of that. We have seen growth in the space, and just underlying growth in the space. And then we've also seen that we have continued to do a nice and nicer job with the global manufacturers, which is one of the things we expected to see. And so I suspect that we are picking up some share in the global manufacturers, vis-à-vis either their own or local processor. So I think it's a little bit. But I wouldn't characterize any of those as 3 points of share. It's half points or quarter points collectively over time.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. And then maybe one for Mike. Can you just help us think about the opportunity for continued free cash flow growth? Should we expect the growth to moderate as you comp in these Synergy Health synergies. And are there any opportunities to improve the working capital?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I would say that with a full year of the combination with Synergy and STERIS, we are north of $300 million. Our goal would be at least to increase cash flow on the net income increase going forward. And then from a working capital standpoint, I think we still have some opportunity in both the receivables, the DSO collection side, and also in inventory. I think those would be the two opportunities we would continue to press going forward.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from – go ahead...
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: I would say just to follow-on, we have said almost since the time we purchased Synergy that AST appears to be stronger than we expected. We still feel the same way. It's being masked by the currency in Europe. So the legacy Synergy part of the AST business doesn't look as strong as it really is. But on a constant currency basis, they are doing nicely. And we expect that to continue. And we expect the efficiencies to continue and probably be more than we are forecasting at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question is from Mr. Dave Turkaly from JPM Securities (sic) [JMP Securities].
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Hi, thanks. Just to kind of follow-up on some of the other questions. From the competitive landscape, maybe even just specifically in the healthcare segment, is there anything new that you're seeing there? Any update that you'd give in terms of that market growth? Or anything that's changed sort of from a competitive landscape?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: No. I mean we have good competitors across the board in all of our – every space we compete in. They're solid competitors. But we don't see I would call it a radical change across the broad spectrum or – there's always some little thing going on. One of us has a new product. And the other one follows with a new product later, those kind of things. But I would call it as a generalized set of competitors. We have good solid competitors in all of our spaces. And we are a solid competitor in all of our spaces. And so I haven't seen what I would call it a significant shift any place.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: And then I know it's certainly probably not a large impact. But is there any way to quantify sort of the timing of the holiday shutdown or the inventory management by the customers, either in a percent or a dollar basis in this quarter?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: No. I don't think we would do that. We know there were slowdowns. We know we were – we know we slowed down. We know that there were shutdowns. We can't do a one-to-one correlation. And we know we're picking back up. So that's what we know. But to quantify that directly would be very difficult.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I will turn the call back for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter.

Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Thanks, Julie, and good morning to all of you. Before Mike reviews the quarter, I thought I would provide some high level commentary on our first half and outlook, as well as an update on our strategies. We said last quarter that we have had a very busy start to the year, and that continued into the second quarter. We have executed on our strategies of divesting non-core assets and acquiring tuck-in businesses. I'd like to spend some time on our actions this fiscal year to help put the total impact of our efforts in perspective. We completed the divestiture of our skin care product line at the end of August, which had annual revenues of less than $50 million. Also at the end of August, we divested two small lab businesses that were a part of legacy Synergy AST. Total annual revenue from the lab businesses was less than $15 million. On the acquisition front, early in the quarter we purchased Medisafe, which we discussed in detail on our August call. Since then, we have also purchased three businesses in the instrument repair space, two of which are in the UK. The repair businesses are less than $10 million in total revenue. The businesses we divested were outside our current strategic interest and generally lower in growth rate and lower return on invested capital in our hands. The businesses we are acquiring are in our strategic window and provide the opportunity for higher growth and higher ROIC. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities, maintaining our dividend relative to our growth, investing for organic growth in our current businesses, targeting acquisitions in adjacent product and market areas, reducing our total company leverage and, finally, share repurchases to offset dilutions. We've used the inflow of cash from our robust operations and divestitures I've already mentioned to acquire tuck-in businesses, pay down debt, and repurchase shares. While debt has been reduced by over $135 million since closing Synergy, we have also bought about $58 million in stock, all in Q2, acquiring just over 819,000 shares. Today marks the one-year anniversary of our combination with Synergy Health. In many ways, it seems like we've been together for longer than 12 months. Our teams have integrated very well, with similar corporate cultures and values helping the transition. Our integration efforts within the operating businesses is nearly complete, and we are making good progress on the systems work and other efforts necessary to generate anticipated back office efficiencies. As we stand today, we now believe that we will exceed our cost savings targets for this fiscal year, as we have been successful in accelerating some cost savings originally anticipated in fiscal 2018. Thus, we now expect about $20 million in cost savings this fiscal year, and $15 million in fiscal 2018. As I have alluded to before, we now believe we will exceed the $40 million overall cost savings, which was the high end of our $30 million to $40 million target that we set at the time of the combination, but that will take some additional time. Looking at our results for the first half of the fiscal year, we have had a good first half overall, with 5% constant currency organic revenue growth. Our revenue in the second quarter was a bit lighter than we anticipated, but we are pleased with the trends in the first half. Our Healthcare Products capital equipment shipments have been flat so far this year, but we continue to believe that the record-setting backlog we have accumulated will allow us to have strong shipments in the second half of the year. And our pipeline for capital orders appears to remain solid into the future. For the full year, we expect revenue growth in healthcare capital equipment. Our HSS segment clearly has the most opportunity for profit improvement, and has the most noise in its numbers, given acquisitions and divestitures. Looking at the total segment, we've seen a contraction in the legacy Synergy linen and sterile med businesses. In addition, the legacy Synergy outsourced sterile processing business in Europe has had its growth masked by the decline of the British pound and euro. In our IMS business, we have grown 4% organically in the first half and continue to expect mid-single-digit growth this fiscal year, with a return to more normalized operating margins over the second half of the year. Life Sciences and AST have both shown strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year, driven by solid organic revenue growth and contributions from acquisitions. I would remind everyone that the AST business will face an FX headwind in its year-to-year comparisons for the second half of the year as the combination anniversaries. That is because the Synergy AST business is largely denominated in euro and British pounds. However, the legacy Synergy AST business has performed very well on a constant currency basis. Based on our first half performance and expectations for a strong second half, we are maintaining our constant currency organic revenue growth outlook of 6% for the year. We're at 5% for the first half, with no growth in hospital capital equipment sales, so we believe 6% for the year is achievable. And as we stated last quarter, to be clear, we have stripped out the divestitures from the prior year in calculating our organic revenue growth. We expect solid organic constant currency revenue growth from all four segments on this basis. I would like to comment briefly on the impact of currency movements, specifically related to the British pound. As we have started in the past, we now have somewhat of a natural currency hedge in terms of overall company profitability. Even with the significant devaluation of the pound so far this fiscal year, we are holding about neutral due to currency fluctuations on the bottom line based on our exposure to foreign currencies. In our case, the weakness in the peso and Canadian dollar has helped to reduce our costs enough to offset the negative impact from the pound and euro this fiscal year on earnings. From a revenue perspective, the devaluation of the British pound and strength of the U.S. dollar is negatively impacting revenue. In total, we anticipate an FX headwind of approximately $25 million in revenue for the full fiscal year as compared to our original guidance. Largely as a result of divestitures and the slowdown in growth outside of the U.S., we are updating our expectations for total company revenue for the fiscal year and now expect total company revenue growth in the range of 19% to 20%. We are maintaining our original full-year outlook for earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.85 to $4 despite the substantial decline in revenue from our original guidance. Compared to our original outlook, divestitures will reduce revenue by about $90 million in fiscal 2017, while trimming earnings per share nearly $0.10. $0.05 of that is from the UK Linen sale, with the balance being a combination of our other divestitures. The businesses we acquired will add revenue of about $20 million in fiscal 2017 and add around $0.05 in EPS this fiscal year. For this year, the acceleration of cost synergies related to the synergy combination will approximately offset the net negative bottom-line impact from the divestitures and acquisitions. Our FY 2017 outlook for the remaining financial measures, free cash flow, the effective tax rate and capital expenditures also remain unchanged. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our adjusted financial results. Before I get into the numbers, let me remind all of you that prior year comparisons are to legacy STERIS unless otherwise noted. Our second quarter total revenue grew 32%. Growth was driven by acquisitions plus 3% constant currency organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth was almost entirely driven by volume as price was favorable by 20 basis points and currency was unfavorable by 60 basis points. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter decreased 410 basis points to 38.6%. As expected, Synergy negatively impacted year-over-year gross margin by approximately 430 basis points in the second quarter. Gross margin was favorably impacted by 40 basis points coming from the suspension of the medical device excise tax, 30 basis points due to foreign currency and 20 basis points improvement from pricing and divestitures. Product mix negatively impacted gross margin by 70 basis points. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue in the quarter declined 440 basis points to 19.1% of revenue, more than offsetting the change in gross margin as a percentage of revenue due to the way we account for the operations of Synergy. EBIT margin at 17.2% of revenue represents a 90-basis-point improvement as compared to the prior year. We are very pleased with our ability to continue to leverage revenue growth to expand margins. EBIT margin benefited from the impact of the positive contributors to gross margin as well as lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue. Foreign currency was about neutral to EBIT in the quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.1%, down slightly due primarily to favorable discrete item adjustments. Adjusted net income in the quarter increased 53% to $76.4 million or $0.89 per diluted share. Moving on to our segment results, our Healthcare Products segment revenue grew 5% in the quarter. Organic revenues were flat in the quarter, mainly due to a decline in capital equipment shipments. Consumable revenue increased 15%, of which 7% was attributable to organic revenue growth. Our Maintenance and Installation Service revenue grew 3% in the quarter. We continue to believe that the performance in capital equipment revenue is a matter of timing as backlog ended the quarter at $152 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Similar to the last several quarters, we continue to experience an uptick in volume of project orders, which tend to have longer lead times than replacement orders. Healthcare Products' operating income increased 24%, while operating margins improved by 250 basis points to 16.4% of revenue in the quarter. The margin increase is due primarily to operational efficiencies, favorable foreign currency and the suspension of the medical device excise tax. Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment reported revenue for the quarter of $142.8 million, reflecting the addition of Synergy along with 4% organic growth revenue. Healthcare Specialty Services' operating margin decreased in the quarter due primarily to lower than anticipated performance in our IMS business and the addition of Synergy Health sterilization services and linen management businesses. IMS margins have improved sequentially but the results are somewhat masked by the divestiture of the UK Linen Services business. Applied Sterilization Technologies had a good quarter with $115.6 million of revenue. The increase in revenue was driven in part by 3% organic revenue growth plus the addition of Synergy Health, which on a constant currency basis, grew low double digits in the quarter. Applied Sterilization Technologies' operating margin increased to 35.3% of revenue due primarily to the increase in organic volume, the addition of Synergy Health and cost savings from the combination with Synergy. Life Sciences also had a good quarter as revenue grew 15% in the second quarter driven by 6% organic revenue growth and contributions from acquisitions. Consumable revenue grew 16%, partly due to the acquisition of GEPCO as well as solid high-single-digit revenue growth. Service revenue grew 20% with low-single-digit organic revenue growth plus the addition of new service offerings. Capital equipment revenue grew 6% in the second quarter, and backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $41 million. Life Sciences' second quarter operating margin at 27.9% of revenue, down slightly from the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable product mix within capital equipment and lower service parts volume. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $254.4 million of cash, and approximately $1.5 billion in total debt. We continue to reduce our debt-to-EBITDA leverage, which at quarter-end was just over 2.5 times. Since acquiring Synergy Health, our total outstanding debt has been reduced by over $135 million, putting us slightly ahead of our original debt reduction expectations. Our DSO is at 60 days at quarter-end, an increase of two days as compared to the prior year. The increase, as we have stated before, is based on the fact that we include 100% of an acquisition's accounts receivable balance, but only include revenue since we've acquired them in the calculation. Our DSO would be materially the same, taking the acquisition's relevant revenue into account. Free cash flow for the first six months was $108.9 million, a substantial increase from last year, primarily due to higher net income and a reduction in acquisition-related expenses. Included in free cash flow for the quarter is approximately $4 million of cash expenses related to the integration of acquisitions. Capital spending was $38.5 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $50.1 million. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open up Q&A.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. Amber, would you please give the instructions and we'll open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question will be from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is open. You may proceed.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Good morning.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Good morning, Larry.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, Walt, maybe starting with you, I have two questions. I guess, coming back to the Healthcare Products capital equipment and the trends that you've seen thus far in the year, maybe you could expand a little bit on why you've sort of seen this flattish sales profile in the business, in terms of the revenue recognition? And then what gives you really the confidence that this second half will accelerate? Because I assume that's important in terms of taking you from the roughly 5% organic growth in the legacy business that you've seen in the first half to achieving that 6% for the year.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure, Larry. I would say there's a couple things. First, as we've mentioned, our project business, which tends to be slower turn business from the time it is ordered till the time it is shipped, that project business has grown as a percent of our total order book, if you will, or backlog and order book. And as a result, you would expect the backlog to expand some as that occurred and, in fact, it has. Secondly, there were some – in the second quarter, as is often the case in the capital equipment business – there were a few orders that we would have thought we might have gotten out in the quarter and they just slipped into the next quarter. So there's always a little bit of temporal movement and we had a bit of temporal movement this quarter. But the bulk of it, I would say, is the growing amount of project business versus the other. Now, typically, the projects, although we know about them for a year-and-a-half to two years ahead of time, typically project orders ship in the six- to nine-month window. So we see that window – we started growing here. You remember, we started talking about this maybe a couple of quarters ago. So we're starting to see those project ships [shipments], and we will accelerate those project shipments over the next six months. So we have pretty good visibility to that going forward the next six months. We're also – and that's largely the North American side of the business, which is what we generally talk about because it's the bulk of our business, dominated by the U.S., of course. But I would also add that our international business seems to be picking up. Although, again, we're not seeing the shipment side of it, we're beginning to see, I think, the bottoming out in much of Latin America, particularly Brazil. Our Asian business has picked up in terms of orders, and we're seeing pipeline in those spaces. Outside of the Middle East, actually, everything seems to be picking up some. We're not sure if that will hit this year, but it puts reinforcement that we're not shrinking in addition. And as a result, we feel even more confident about the total shipments.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And then, second question, just on the topic of IMS. It sounded like it was, again, a bit softer than you had anticipated for the 2Q here. So maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? How you're thinking about some of those contracts that you indicated were delayed? Have you lost any business? And then, if you could weave in there, I couldn't help but be interested in the comment about the acquisitions in the UK of an instrument reprocessing type business and how that bolts on to the outsourced business for Synergy because that would seem like a big opportunity over time.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I'll separate the two questions. First, on IMS, as you know, we missed the first quarter significantly compared to what we thought we would see. The second quarter improved. So we missed it a little bit. And so we are improving. We are seeing both sequential growth and year-over-year growth, although we were hoping for high single digits by now. From our original forecast, we were expecting high single digits; we're now seeing mid-single digits. So we're a bit behind where our original expectation was, but they are moving toward their expectation. And their current view, as the run rate going out, will be not unlike what they originally anticipated. So at a high level that's the IMS story. The second question you asked about, Instrument Repair. We do believe Instrument Repair is a significant strategic piece of our business, which is why we have invested in it and continue to invest in it. We do believe it will be nicely profitable in the mid- to long-term. And there's, clearly, in our view, a fit between that and the Synergy outsourcing business. So in many respects one is a stepping stone to the other, depending on where you are. For Synergy, this is a stepping stone into insourcing. For us, we have the insource parts and it will help us step to the Synergy business. So we definitely do consider this a part of the puzzle.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. You may proceed.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Yes. Just a follow-up on the IMS. I'm wondering if you're planning any further divestitures in that business, and if you could quantify the investments there currently being made in IMS?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Jason, we don't anticipate any divestitures on that side. Obviously, the investments that we are making, we did two acquisitions, relatively small acquisitions, spending about 20-ish million dollars in total for those acquisitions. But, I think, what we're alluding to is the investments in the people and the service techs that we are making, as we continue to expand this business, especially throughout the U.S. and, obviously, with the acquisition in the UK, we have definitely – see an opportunity longer term over in that area. So that's what we're talking about.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: And I would add, we don't discuss forward acquisitions or divestitures in general. And as a result, we would not get into any specifics on any acquisitions or divestitures in the business.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: And looking at Life Science, I mean, had decent operating income growth year-over-year, up 9%. Why was it not higher given consumables were up in the high single digits organically?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. Jason, we had some – in our capital equipment, we had some unfavorable margin mix that put some pressure on the bottom line. Although the top line did well, that lower-margin capital equipment kept the margins a little bit slightly lower than they were year-over-year. In addition to that, we had some – last year, we saw some stronger parts volume for the Life Sciences capital equipment, and that was a bit weaker this year, which, again, put a little bit of pressure on margins. But all in all, consumable is doing very well. Service, still doing well. And, I would say, the segment in general is doing very well.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. I would add, we have mixed up a little bit in service, too, and service doesn't carry quite the margins that the consumables side of the business does. It's kind of a blend between the capital side and the consumables side, so it sits more in the middle.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And then finally, I wonder if you could walk us through the timeline of the upcoming IT system implementations for Synergy?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. So, Jason, I think as we've talked about, the first step in that, changing the platform for Synergy and combining to one global system was for us to get off of the Oracle 11i platform for the legacy STERIS side and go on to the Oracle R12 platform, which from the legacy STERIS side we have successfully completed in this second quarter. So we've taken the first step. Now, what we have to do is go out and work with the acquisition, specifically Synergy, to map out how we're going to take them from their current IFS financial system onto the new Oracle R12 system. We still believe that it's probably about an 18-month project from start to finish, and we are just starting to embark on that project.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Thank you.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from David Turkaly of JMP Securities. Your line is open.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Thanks. On the AST side, obviously, and I think you mentioned you had sold two small labs, but it's still very profitable. I was wondering if you might just talk about where you see the margin of that business going for you ahead?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: First of all, AST has been a real positive, and I would say the legacy Synergy portion, even more positive on balance, so we feel very good about that business. The lab businesses we sold were consumer lab businesses that had come with previous acquisitions, and although they were nice little businesses in their own right, they didn't fit anything that we do in any part of our business, so it just made sense to exit those. The margins – we concentrate a lot more on growing profit dollars and ROIC than we do on margins. Margin is a path to get there without question. And we do have high margin in that business, but we have a lot of capital invested in that business, too, so the ROIC, although is now quite attractive, it is not over the top. So we do think we have some margin expansion capability as we bring on more products – more clients, I should say, which gives us greater capacity and as the full integration of the AST businesses comes to fruition. So we do have some opportunities there. I always caution people, when we save money, we often take some to the bottom line and we often pass some on to our customers in the forms of better pricing, so we maintain or grow our market share, so I would not take everything to the bottom line, but we do think that there's opportunity there.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: And then just quickly over to the repo side. Can you just remind us what you still have authorized and if you have it, sort of what the price was in the quarter for this stock you bought back? Thank you.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. So, for the quarter, we spent about $58 million of our $300 million authorization, which the board and the shareholders granted to us back in the July timeframe. That was about 819,000 shares for that $58 million in repurchase or about $71 per share on average.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Thank you.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: And I would add that that's consistent with our view of stock buybacks to offset dilution and very consistent in that format.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Chris Cooley of Stephens. Your line is open.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Walt, if we can maybe just start bigger picture? You've obviously had a good first half. You've anniversaried the acquisition of Synergy. And you alluded in your prepared comments that you're a little bit ahead of schedule, both in terms of realization of cost synergies as well as in paying down related debt, turning the portfolio a little bit. Kind of in light of what we're seeing here in this lovely third quarter earnings season in healthcare, could you maybe just talk a little bit more broadly about what you see through the back half of your fiscal year, but kind of into the early part of the calendar year 2017 just in terms of anything from an operating trend standpoint, and then how that basically trues-up to your original expectations when you think about the guidance that you provided here for the type of growth in cash flow that we could see from the business? And then, I have just one quick nuts-and-bolts follow-up for Mike.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure. You know, Chris, it is typical of us to have a second half that is stronger than our first half. So we don't see anything radically out of line to our normal, I'll call it, seasonality or pattern. A, when you're growing, the second half should be stronger than the first half; and B, there has been historic seasonality in the way we manage the business, which causes the second half to be in some ways stronger than you might even expect. And we don't see that any different. We do – because of capital, we are a little behind, actually, where we thought we would be. It's all gone into backlog, so we're perfectly happy with that. Orders are staying consistent and our pipeline, in front of us – we look at – pipeline to us is the backlog plus the projects that we are working on, projects and business that we are working on. And we still see a solid pipeline of business. As I mentioned, we're actually seeing, we think, the bottoming out of some places where we had historically been strong. Venezuela is still tough but the rest of Latin America seems to be picking up, and so we're beginning to see some pipeline of orders there. Asia, we're actually up year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, mainly in the southeastern parts of Asia. But China is also picking up as well for us. So we're feeling more comfortable there, looking out beyond the quarter, if you will. And Europe has held for us during this time and, we think, absent the currency issues, we think the European business, both on the capital side as well as, importantly, on the Synergy side, the AST business is strengthening. We're putting capacity on the face of that strengthening. So we are generally seeing positive volumes across our business in most every segment and, as a result, are feeling more and more comfortable. Now, governments change and they change what they do and all those good things, so you never know for sure; but I think that's far enough out into the future that, for the time period you're talking about, we don't see that being a significant issue.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. And then, Mike, if you could just help us a little bit more. I greatly appreciate the color you guys provided when you think about the adds from the divestitures, offset by the acquisitions and cost savings, but could you help us think a little bit more about currency? Now, as we all get more comfortable with the greater exposure of the pound, just in terms of translation, how we should think about that going forward? Just want to make sure that, when we kind of make these adjustments going forward, we get the reported top-line range correct. Could you maybe just help us a little bit more there with the dependencies or, I should say, the reliance on the various currencies?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. As we have continued to look at and, I think, and Walt addressed, I thought, very nicely, the impact of our currency. So just to review, as a total consolidated company, we like a strong euro and a strong pound. I mean, that definitely helps us in both a revenue and a profit standpoint. We also like a weak peso and a weak Canadian dollar. That also helps us. Again, that's in general. So, just as it so happens, this past quarter, actually even for the first half of the year, we have seen a weakened pound and a stronger peso, which, for us, those currency baskets offset very nicely. And it does hurt our revenue, and for the full year, we are anticipating a $25 million headwind versus our original guidance, so that's the full year impact of revenue. The bulk of that is – as you can imagine – is the pound. But then, on the opposite side, we are anticipating about neutral impact on the bottom line. And the offset of the reduction in income from the pound is being offset, or almost more than offset, by the reduction of the peso from a cost standpoint. So, I think we're very nicely balanced here. And if you look at the forward rates, which we do use, looking at the next six months, I think that will still hold true. I think you're going to see those two currencies move against each other, and help protect us from a bottom line standpoint.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: And I think Mike was thinking about profit when he said strengthening of the peso. The peso has obviously fallen, which strengthens our profit.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah. Right.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: It's not a stronger peso. It's a weaker peso, which leads to stronger profitability.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And if I may, can I just maybe squeeze one more quick one in here, and I'll get back in queue. When you look at the growth we've seen in, in particular, in the healthcare capital backlog, could you maybe help us just a little bit more – characterize a little bit better? I know you touched on this earlier with Larry's question. But, when you think about the switch that we've seen, really, kind of fundamentally over the last three quarters to project versus replacement capital, help us kind of get a better understanding there of the visibility that you have into that pull-through. And what gives you that added degree of confidence that you'll see that acceleration here in the back half? And congratulations on a good quarter.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Sure, Chris. The orders that are project orders do have more timing risk, almost by definition, because they're putting it into a building project typically, and construction delays and all those things are fairly routine. When we look at our pipe – we've been doing this a long time. And so, we don't presume that they will ship when they think they're going to ship. We know they have a date, but we presume certain lags in those dates, and we have gotten pretty accustomed to different markets having different lag times. So we do have some reasonable amount of visibility, and, clearly, when we're looking at milestones, quarters and years, we are more sensitive to those delays than other times. So we do try to measure that, monitor it, and also to land the plane in the right time for our customers and us. And oftentimes, we have the ability to pull, if Project A gets behind, from a vast amount of our product line. We can substitute this washer from Project A to that washer to Project B or this operating table from Project A to that Project B or do a quick-turn order. So we do have ability to manage somewhat within that. But in the last week or two or three of a quarter, depending on what a hospital says, we don't ship things they don't need or want. So if you pick up and they say (38:05) we can't have some minor disruptions, and that risk is higher in projects. So there's a little more risk for any given month or any given quarter, but that risk is well within our normal limits of handling it.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: And Chris, just one added comment there is, as we do look at that, I'll call it the backlog aging comparison, we look at how many quarters, a full year out of quarters. We have, actually, if you look at this year versus last year, we actually have a little bit more favorability in the shipments of that backlog this half, the second half of this year versus the second half of last year, so that also gives us comfort.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: So, Chris, what we look at is, of our backlog, how much is supposed to ship in next period. In this case, Michael is talking about the second six months of this year versus a percentage of our backlog that should have shipped in the second percentage (38:59) of last year. And we have a higher percentage sitting there but we don't expect to ship in the following years ...
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Correct.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: ... which is what I'm saying, and that is one of the other measures we gauge.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. Understood. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Matt Mishan of KeyBanc. Your line is open, sir.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Hey, Matt.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Hey, Matt.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, I just want to make sure I fully understand your constant currency organic growth guidance and, really, the 2H ramp from the first half. If I'm not mistaken, the organic growth guidance is now going to be including five months of Synergy Health, so it's going to be organic Synergy Health from November through the end of March. Could you just kind of walk through the various moving pieces of why you think you're going to move from, like, a 5% in the first half to 7%?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: You know, the biggest impact is the capital equipment in the product space, the Healthcare Product space, where we're flat and we don't expect to be flat for the year. We don't forecast that externally specifically, but we expect solid growth for the full year, so that's the single-biggest impact. When you look at Synergy pieces, at a high-level, we've kind of talked about it. We know that sterile med is not growing; in fact, it's the opposite. We know that some of the linen businesses are not growing; in fact, the opposite. The flipside of that is, when you look at the – in constant currency, which is what we're talking about, when we look at the HSS business in Europe, it's doing nicely in terms of growth and profitability except for the fact that we have this currency issue going on. And when you look at the AST business, it's doing better than nicely, except for the currency issues going on. So when you put that all together – I mean, at a high-level, that's the Synergy story. But, really, the bigger story in terms of the change in percentage, first half to second half, is the Healthcare Products story not the Synergy story.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then Walt, a bigger picture question, can you talk about your sea level conversations on expanding on outsourced central sterile (41:25) processing in the U.S.?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: No different than what we've talked before. So it's a great question, and we have had a number of places that we are talking to about this potential. This is concept selling, not selling a widget in 5 minutes kind of sale. So we've had a number of conversations. We have some things that we think are quite attractive out in the future. But as I've said from the very beginning, this is a nascent business in the U.S. We're going to see one, and then see another one, and then I think things will pick up. But this is not going to be something that has a material impact this year.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, I'm not sure if I missed it or not. I had a couple of calls this morning. Can you talk about what's driving the weakness at sterile med?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Well, yes, I can. We do not control the revenue cycle of sterile med where, in effect, it's not quite the same thing. We're a reprocessor but you could think of us as a contract manufacturer. So it is just the input we have from J&J, who's the parent of that company or from their sterile med division. They have not had strong growth in this current year so far.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Is that something you expect to change going forward or is that like an ongoing trend that's been impacting you through the last six months, nine months, a year, or is there any change in that?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Yeah. We don't forecast other people's businesses. And so, I would be hesitant to make that forecast, but we're not counting on a significant increase at this point in time in our forecast.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. And then, if I could just squeeze one more in. Walt, who is going to win tonight? The Indians or the Cubs?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: As long as you don't count it against my forecast of the business, independent of which way but, there is an ever so strong leaning toward the Indians around here. I don't quite understand why that would be. There is an ever so strong leaning towards the Indians. In fact, two of the four people in front of you, if you could see us, not hear us, are wearing Indian shirts as we speak.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Well, good luck, tonight, and go, Tribe.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. We have one more question, and that will be from Mitra Ramgopal from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to double check, the revised guidance in terms of the revenue, that's not assuming any potential divestitures or acquisitions going forward, at least, for the rest of the year. Is that correct?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Generally speaking, that's correct.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: That is typical of us. We typically would not include acquisitions that we're working on that may not occur. And we typically would not include divestitures we're working on that may not occur.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And back on the Life Sciences business, the backlog we're seeing, at least, for the first half of this year versus what we've seen in the last couple of years. Is there something – some of it, I know, could be just timing, but is it more industry issues as you see it?
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Yeah, Mitra. I would say it's more timing. If we get into – if we cross the $40 million mark, that actually gives us comfort there, but we'll see that go $5 million to $7 million flip back and forth. But yeah, it's mostly timing.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. And on the manufacturing and sourcing initiatives, I don't know if you have an update. Is that pretty much behind you right now or still being implemented?
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: The items that we discussed with you, historically, are complete or virtually complete, so we have captured the benefit of those. But we are always looking for opportunities to improve our production methods and to improve what we physically control. So I would not expect that – or I will try to say it differently – I would expect us to continue to in-source things in our local production. But when we discussed – and it's a routine piece of work for us, actually, but when we discussed it with you earlier, it was largely because we were spending, I don't remember, $30 million roughly to build the capital, to put the capital in place to be able to do that. Now that capital is not fully utilized just for the things that put we put in place, so it gives us the opportunity to do more in-sourcing as we go forward. But if there's a significant emphasis that's going to be a material piece of the business in a short period of time, we would bring it to your attention just as we did a couple of years ago. But when it's just an ongoing piece of what we do, it's just a part of our capturing efficiencies and qualities. But I fully anticipate we will continue that for the next – for the foreseeable future anyway.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. Understood. Again, thanks for taking the questions and good luck tonight.
Michael J. Tokich - STERIS Plc: Thanks, Mitra.
Walter M. Rosebrough - STERIS Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I show no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - STERIS Plc: Thank you, Amber, and thank you, all of you, for joining us. We all will be rooting for the Indians. Hope you will be as well. And we'll talk to you soon.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our adjusted financial results. Before I get into the numbers, let me remind you that all prior-year comparisons are to legacy STERIS, unless otherwise noted. We had a good start to our fiscal year with 6% constant currency organic revenue growth along with contributions from acquisitions. Our revenue growth was almost entirely driven by volume as price was just slightly favorable and foreign currency was unfavorable to revenue by 40 basis points. Legacy Synergy revenue in constant currency grew low-single-digits during the quarter, which is in line with our expectations. This number, however, is getting increasingly difficult to accurately estimate as we continue to move down the path of integrating our businesses. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter decreased 370 basis points to 38.2%. As expected, Synergy negatively impacted year-over-year gross margin by approximately 500 basis points. As we have stated before, we found that Synergy used a different policy to classify costs between COGS and SG&A as compared to legacy STERIS. Offsetting that, we had favorability from foreign currency of 50 basis points, a 40 basis point increase from the suspension of the medical device excise tax and a 30 basis point improvement from pricing and productivity. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue in the quarter declined 480 basis points to 20% of revenue, more than offsetting the change in gross margin as a percentage of revenue due mainly to Synergy Health. EBIT margin at 15.9% of revenue represents a 200 basis point improvement as compared to the prior-year quarter. EBIT margin benefited from the impact of the positive contributors to gross margin as well as lower SG&A and R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue. The effective tax rate was 24.5%, slightly below our anticipated full-year rate of 25% due to favorable discrete item adjustments. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximate 25% for the full year. Net income in the quarter increased to $68.4 million while earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 27% to $0.79. Moving on to our segment results, our Healthcare Products segment revenue grew 8% in the quarter, driven by 3% organic revenue growth and contributions from acquisitions. Consumable revenue increased 20%, of which 9 percentage points was attributable to organic growth. Capital equipment revenue in the quarter was flat. We are pleased with our order activity in healthcare capital equipment in the quarter and feel good about the year, as backlog ended the quarter at $149 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, we are seeing an uptick in project orders, which tend to have longer lead times than replacement orders. Operating margins for Healthcare Products increased 110 basis points to 12.3% of revenue in the quarter. The increase is due primarily to higher volumes, favorable foreign currency, the suspension of the medical device excise tax, somewhat offset by higher R&D expenses. Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment reported revenue for the quarter of $157.9 million, reflecting the addition of Synergy Health along with 5% organic revenue growth. Healthcare Specialty Services operating income decreased slightly in the quarter, due primarily to the lower than anticipated performance in our IMS business, which Walt will discuss in more detail in a moment. Applied Sterilization Technologies had a good quarter with $116.6 million in revenue. The increase in revenue was driven by the addition of Synergy Health and solid organic revenue growth of 7% for the quarter. Applied Sterilization Technologies operating margin increased to 34% of revenue, due primarily to the increase in volume and the addition of Synergy. Life Sciences revenue grew 43% in the first quarter, driven by 18% organic revenue growth and contributions from acquisitions. Capital equipment revenue was strong in the quarter, although we had somewhat easy comparisons with the first quarter of last year. And backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $41.3 million. Consumable revenue grew 62%, partly due to the acquisition of GEPCO and partly due to mid-teens organic revenue growth. Service revenue grew 20%, due to low single-digit organic revenue growth plus the addition of new service offerings. Life Sciences' first quarter operating margin increased to 30.1% of revenue, due to a favorable mix shift towards consumables, an increase in volume and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $242.4 million of cash and approximately $1.55 billion in total debt. We continue to reduce our debt to EBITDA leverage, which was about 2.6 times at quarter end. Our DSO was 62 days at quarter end, an increase of five days as it compared to last year. As we have said before, the increase is based on the fact that we include 100% of an acquisition's accounts receivable balance but only include the revenue since we've acquired them in our calculation. Our DSO would be materially the same taking the acquisitions' relevant revenue into account. Free cash flow for the first three months of $49.5 million, a substantial increase from the prior year and a solid start to the fiscal year. Included in free cash flow for the quarter is approximately $4 million of cash expenses related to the integration of acquisitions. Capital spending was $35.4 million in the quarter while depreciation and amortization was $53.8 million. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Michael has covered the quarter, so I will focus on our recent transactions and our outlook for the year. We've had a strong and busy start to the year, executing on the strategies we put in place while working to meet the needs of our customers. Let me recap a few highlights. On the 1st of July we completed the sale of our UK Linen business for approximately £50 million. For fiscal 2017 that business was expected to generate approximately $40 million in revenue for the balance of the year. We used some of the proceeds from that sale just a few weeks later when we paid about £27 million to buy Medisafe Holdings. Medisafe is a UK manufacturer of washer disinfector equipment and it also markets related consumables and services. We paid about two times revenue for the business, which carries operating margins in line with our Healthcare Products segment. We are pleased to welcome Medisafe to STERIS as their products and services complement our global healthcare offering by providing washer R&D and production in the UK. Now of course both of these transactions occurred after the recent Brexit vote. Although we have exited UK linens, we are not backing away from our plans to grow in the UK. We are watching the UK Brexit politics like everyone else but our initial belief is that the result of Brexit on our business in the near term is likely to be primarily currency fluctuations. We are obviously impacted by changes in the pound when translated to U.S. dollars. As we've described in the past, the UK is about 10% of our revenue. Given the nature of the business that we have in the UK, most of the revenue and cost is UK in-country. So we have a natural cost hedge to help offset the impact of fluctuations in the British pound. As a reminder, the Synergy combination itself was also a natural hedge to the legacy STERIS currency position in terms of overall company profitability. Our profitability now generally benefits from a strong euro and a strong British pound and a weak peso and a weak Canadian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar. As a result of these two business development actions, and reflecting the updated forward currency rates, we are adjusting our revenue outlook for fiscal 2017. Let me break down the pieces a bit as we do have a few moving parts. Total company revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%. Compared to our original outlook, we are reducing our revenue growth expectations by 300 basis points to reflect the UK Linen and Medisafe transactions we have completed this fiscal year, anticipated changes in foreign currency and a reduction in revenue growth expectations for our IMS business. Since the UK Linen business divestiture, Medisafe acquisition and the exchange rate impacts are fairly straightforward, let me spend some time on IMS. We had a second consecutive nice growth year in IMS in fiscal 2016, ending the year with double-digit organic revenue growth. We plan to continue to grow at a similar level in FY17. Our first quarter started slower than anticipated in IMS with mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and we are tempering our IMS expectations for the full year as a result. As Mike mentioned, this also impacted IMS profitability somewhat in Q1 as our investments were aligned with a faster-growth business plan. We will reduce the growth rate of IMS spending for the balance of the year. So we now expect to see an improvement in that unit's profitability compared with Q1 levels in the second half of the fiscal year. The combination of all these moving pieces results in an expectation of approximately 6% organic revenue growth for the year compared with our original 7% growth outlook. To be clear, for your modeling purposes we have stripped the UK Linen business out of all relevant periods in our current estimate of organic growth. Although we have reduced our revenue growth expectations, our adjusted EPS range is unchanged at $3.85 to $4 per diluted share. As we mentioned before, the addition of Synergy to legacy STERIS has somewhat increased revenue volatility to foreign exchange fluctuations in U.S. dollar terms. However, the impact on profitability is more naturally hedged than it was before the combination. So the total impact of changes in foreign currency, the sale of the UK Linen business and the acquisition of Medisafe all combined is anticipated to create about $0.05 of dilution in adjusted EPS, which can be absorbed in the EPS outlook range. We currently anticipate that the previously discussed IMS earnings shortfall will be made up by improvements in the rest of the business as we continue to see strength in our North American healthcare, our global AST and global Life Science businesses. As we said last quarter, we continue to review our portfolio of products and services to determine what to invest in going forward. We are working on a number of possible actions, including both disposal of non-core assets and tuck-in acquisitions, which may be completed this fiscal year. We will update you on our actions and the relevant impact to our outlook on quarterly earnings calls as appropriate. While this may create some minor short-term modeling and forecasting challenges, we are working to redeploy our capital in order to generate greater value over the longer term. Our FY17 outlook for the remaining financial measures – free cash flow, the effective tax rate, capital expenditures and cost synergies from the combination with Synergy Health, which continues to go nicely – remain unchanged for the fiscal year, as do our capital allocation priorities. With that, I will turn the call over to Julie to begin Q&A.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. Alice, will you please give the instructions and we will get started with Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Mr. Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President: Hey, Larry.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Larry.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So Walt, I was hoping we'd get started on IMS and maybe give us some help understanding, you know, what you are seeing out there that led to the lower performance starting out the year. And then how are you thinking about, again, more from a revenue perspective through the year – I understand obviously that you are going to readjust your cost to be more consistent, but just any thoughts around that would be helpful.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Larry. We see this as a temporal issue, not any kind of a permanent issue, if you will. We have a natural growth rate. I mean the general growth rate of that business in total is roughly in line with healthcare. The question is how much business moves from hospitals doing it themselves or from the OEMs moving to third-party participants. And there we've seen double-digit kind of numbers. We expect to continue to see double-digit kind of numbers. But within that there's always some churn, some going to us from us to us from us. We actually ended last year stronger than we expected and so we had quite positive churn. We probably got a little more optimistic than we should about that. So we've had some negative churn now in this current timeframe. But in terms – and so it take some times to work through that because we had invested presuming we would hold all that business and continue to take some. So we are a little bit behind our current forecast. In that kind of business it doesn't – it's not like capital where you get a big order and then you lose a big order; it is an ongoing business. So the long term we don't expect it to be any different than our previous thinking. It's just a short-term aberration in our view.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then two other ones, I guess one for you, Walt, and then for Mike. For you, again you know obviously saw that you increased the dividend. That's again consistent with your focus on maintaining and actually growing the dividend. You also announced a $300 million share repurchase, which is about 5% of the current market cap, so nice size. And I recognize that that will be tapped into over time. But could you just talk a little bit again about where you see sort of deleveraging and share repurchase priorities, call it over the next couple years? And then the second question is just on the HSS margins, which were 2%. Again, I assume a lot of that has to do with IMS, but well below that kind of double-digit bogey that you always talk about. And again wanted to take your temperature on what's driving the 2%, which is down sequentially, and what drives it up.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I guess I'll break, two basic questions. One's a capital allocation question, let's call it, and the other one is the profitability in that business segment.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: On the capital allocation question, we don't feel any differently. We've moved down nicely already. Mike mentioned we were down to 2.6. You know, someplace in the 2.2 to 2.3 range, around 2-ish if you will, is kind of what we think the sweet spot is. And so we will be working our way down. And we continue to plan to work our way down. So that still is the priority. In terms of the rest of the capital allocation, we're going to invest in our current businesses. We'll invest in the tuck-in type of acquisitions to add on to our businesses. And then stock buybacks is a third. I should mention that we had I think about $100 million left, Mike?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President: About $80 million.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. About $80 million left in our previous authorization when we moved to Synergy Plc and in that process we needed to get a reauthorization from shareholders to do anything, so we actually had zero authorization going into this quarter. So this is just, I'll call it for lack of better terms, a re-up of our normal type of authorization. We've done this over the last seven or eight years. This is the third $300 million authorization. So it's not a change in philosophy or change in thinking. And generally speaking, unless we see a dearth of acquisition-type opportunities or tuck-in opportunities, we would expect to be purchasing shares only to offset dilution. That's kind of our general thinking. So that I think answers that one, and that's really no change from what we've been talking about now since we announced the Synergy deal. The second thing is, as you know, I don't like anything that's making single-digit ROS. There are differences in businesses. Our AST business has a much higher capital requirement, so it has to make higher ROS to make appropriate ROIC, and that's in the long run we create value by growing things and having ROIC above our cost of capital. That's what we want to do and to the extent we can even get higher ROIC the better. So we do, there are different ROS criteria for the businesses to get to the appropriate ROIC, but clearly those are not where we would want them to be or would like them to be. We do expect them to see double digits. But part of that is we've got a combination of some businesses that are relatively low ROIC like the Linen business combined with – or ROS or ROIC for that matter – like the Linen businesses as well as businesses where we are investing because we believe the long term they will have good profitability because we've seen that model in the UK. So it's a combination of those things. As you know, I don't put real targets on an end-point profitability but I definitely like to see double digits. And I don't see us feeling any differently about that than we did a year ago or two years ago or three years ago. But we do see investment opportunities here and growth opportunities and we anticipate doing that.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, very good. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Matt Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Aubrey on for Matt. Can you hear me okay?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes certainly, Aubrey.
Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about what else is going on in the rest of the HSS segment outside of IMS. I know you still have the Netherlands and UK-based linens business there as well as the outsourced central sterile processing. Are there any changes in what you're seeing across those businesses?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I think you may have meant the U.S. linens business because the UK business we sold. We do both have the U.S. and the Netherlands businesses. As we've mentioned in the past, those are relatively low-margin businesses. And so we haven't seen a significant change. As you noticed, they are still relatively low-margin, low-growth businesses and we haven't seen a change there. In the HSS business, again, that business is a profitable business in the UK and we're investing in other parts of the world to grow that business to duplicate the UK model, so again no change. We still have a lot of interest from customers who are talking to us about potential outsourcing in the U.S. But again, as we've said many, many times, it's going to take time for that to come to fruition and we do see it as a nascent business. We don't anticipate any significant revenue profitability in that business certainly in this year, and it's going to be a while before it becomes a material part of the total STERIS profitability map.
Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, got it. And then just last one, if you'd be able to just give a little bit more detail on how you're going to be offsetting that $0.05 headwind that you called out from a combination of the Linen sale, IMS, FX, etcetera, why you have confidence in reiterating your EPS guidance?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, first of all it's a range, not a number, and so we have a $0.15 range and it's a $0.05 headwind. So that certainly is encompassed in that kind of range. And obviously we didn't have our point forecast at where we are at the bottom of that range, the bottom number of that range. So that's one answer. And then the second answer is we do see strength in the North American capital – well, the North American operation in general in healthcare and in the global operations in both Life Science and AST. So we have some very strong positive feelings about that. The rest of the globe for healthcare is a little tough. And so we are just mixing and matching all those components. And at this point in time in the year we did not see it appropriate to change the range.
Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. David Turkaly with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Thanks. I know you mentioned on the Healthcare Products side the project again and obviously we see the increase in the backlog. I'm just curious do you expect that trend to continue throughout the year? And if so, yeah, just any color on why you think that is the case now.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The short answer is we're seeing real strength and we're not alone in that. The other guys in the capital business in North America are seeing real strength there in both orders and generally speaking in backlog. And we also have visibility in pipeline as we mentioned several times; usually three to six months of pretty clear visibility. Our pipeline looks the same as our orders, it's just strong in North America right now. That can always change, but at this point in time we're seeing real strength. And it's been double-digit kind of strength now for six or nine months and so – and it looks like the same kind of strength out in the future, so out in the future meaning six months out or nine months out. So it's a combination of replacement orders are staying strong and projects are increasing, and you put those together and you get some nice increases.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: And then on the Life Science side I know you mentioned some easy comps but mid-teens organic growth. I guess just any color on sort of what your expectations are there and what's driving sort of that mid-teens organic growth. I know in the past there were some times in the past where that was a little slower. But I guess what are you seeing that can give you comfort that that can continue?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'm going to separate the capital piece from the rest, the consumables and service parts. On the capital side, that business has now been steady for five years maybe and our backlog is balanced between $40 million and $45 million roughly for five years. So I don't see any material long-term change there. Mix has changed and our willingness to accept no-profit business has changed. And so the profitability from that business has changed significantly for the good. Now when we look at the consumable side there are a couple pieces that make that up. First of all, our chemistry business has just been quite strong and we have a nice set of chemistries and we've mentioned that we've also added some chemistries to our portfolio. And so those are just picking up speed. So it's pure organic, growing business. We do think we're targeted at good spots, we're targeted at vaccines and biologics, which are nice growing pieces of the pharmaceutical business. So we're just targeting in the right spots and we have some nice products. So we have had good organic growth and we see that continuing. And then the acquisition of our barrier products, which was the company called GEPCO, which is also a consumable product in Life Science, have also been strong. They had good growth but we also have the ability to – they were essentially a U.S. company and so we have a global footprint in the sales force so we have the ability to move those products to global customers outside the United States. So it's a real opportunity for us to grow. So we just see very nice positive movement in Life Science and we continue to expect that on the consumables side of the business.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Thank you very much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Yes, just wanted to follow up on the Life Science question. Didn't know that you are facing some tougher comps in the next few quarters here. Would you expect the growth rate to slow a little due to that or do you think some of the positive factors you mentioned will more than offset the comps?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: On the consumable side, I think the comps are fine and the growth rates are fine. On the capital side, we had some really nice shipments I want to say in the mid part of last year. And so we will clearly not see these kind of growth rates going forward. I think to say the capital business is flat to slightly increasing is the right kind of general way to think about it for the year and for longer term. So it's not – I mean it's a 40% growth for this quarter but that was just because of easy comps and a strong quarter; that a long-term change.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: And the Linen business that was sold, what was the expected operating profit for fiscal 2017 of that business?
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations: We really haven't disclosed that, Jason. I mean we've disclosed the size of the business and been clear that the margins were better than segment average, kind of high-single-digits, and left it at that.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: All right. And looking at your Healthcare Product revenue, what percent of that is outside the U.S. and how do the margins compare?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Healthcare Products, again, it's more dominated in the U.S. because I don't know the number off the top of my head but it's small, so in the 15% to 20% kind of range. Mike is looking for it as we speak. And part of that is because there's a piece of that business that came from Synergy. I just don't happen – and it is predominately O-U.S., so I don't happen to have that number in my head. But the margins O-U.S. are somewhat different because we go through distributors. So we generally do not get the "sales" margin or distributor margin, but we do get the design and manufacturing margins, so that's the predominant difference. Now pricing outside the U.S. is typically a little bit higher because transportation and the distribution cost. I'll call it the end customer's price is typically higher because of those things. But we don't get the distribution margin and we often don't get the service that goes along with it like the installation; some of the services the distributor tends to do that. So at a high level that's the case on capital. On consumables they are roughly similar.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President: And about 70% of our Healthcare Products revenues come outside the U.S.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: All right. That's helpful. And finally...
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, inside the U.S.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President: Sorry, the other way. Inside, yes sorry.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Inside the U.S.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President: Inside the U.S., yes.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: That's what I thought. And finally, any material change in anything outside the U.S. generally from hospitals, any improvements or deterioration in any regions of note?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean, all you have to do is ask what countries are experiencing fiscal difficulty because most countries outside the U.S. are, for lack of better terms, are largely national healthcare programs with government budgets. So all of the countries that are mineral-based or oil-based – all is a big word – but generally speaking those that are mineral-based or oil-based are having difficulty in their government budgets and as a result having difficulty in their healthcare budgets. So kind of off the top of my head in Latin America, Venezuela is just really, really challenged. Brazil is quite challenged. Moving to the Middle East, a big part of the Middle East, which was a very strong healthcare business, has slowed down significantly. And Saudi Arabia in particular, which was a very good healthcare business, has the dual challenge of the weaker oil prices as well as having to fund some war issues at the same time. So Saudi is particularly challenged, but much of the Middle East, the oil-based economies are challenged. We have seen actually a bit of a pick-up in Asia; not China per se, although we've actually kind of done nicely in China. It's a small business for us. But not so much China but the areas outside, so Southeast Asia has clearly been picking up for us but it's still challenged. In Australia, again, a mineral-based economy has been challenged for the last 12 or 18 months.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Thanks a lot.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Cooley with Stephens. Your line is open.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Could we start, Mike, just going back and looking at AST profit here in the quarter, a little bit stronger than what we were modeling there, in fact about 400 basis points stronger. I just want to get a better understanding. Is that as you're starting to get greater utilization of the increase that you've done in capacity, primarily in the U.S., margins are improving? Are you seeing any kind of cut to your raw material or I should say cobalt-60 costs? Or is it just maybe mix? I'm just trying to get a little bit better understanding of what's driving that level of profitability, and then I have a couple of quick follow-ups.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President: Yes certainly, Chris. So the 34% operating margin that you mentioned with AST, I mean a lot of that is, and then we've talked about this before, is we have a high fixed cost base and we did see exceptional volume increases this quarter. So that volume, once we cover the fixed costs, is extremely profitable for us and that is the major driver. On top of that, the integration with Synergy Health is actually moving along very nicely. So we probably get a little bit of a benefit there as we integrate our businesses, but I would say first and foremost it's the volume piece that is driving the large increase.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Okay.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I would mention, Chris, we are bringing a number of plants online and when we're bringing plants online, it means the ones that are currently running are full. So we're running capacity-like numbers in a lot of places and that's a good time to be making some money. We would expect some averaging of that over time. We are trying to have them not come all at once, so we don't have this nice buildup and then a cliff, nice buildup and then a cliff. We are trying to even them out over periods of time. But there is some, if you look at a plant-by-plant basis, it does look like that. We're now getting to be good enough size. I mean we have 60 facilities roughly. So we are getting to be a large enough size that one or two facilities doesn't crush us, but you notice them when they come on board.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. And then if you could just revisit healthcare capital, the growth in the backlog there again very briefly. Historically I think that's been about a 75%, 80% replacement, 20%, 25% new project build-type business. Could you just give us maybe a little bit more color there, and I apologize if I missed at the outset, in terms of that mix here the last several quarters? Because I know in your prepared remarks you mentioned greater growth in new project build. I am just trying to think about what that incremental growth is longer term potentially for both consumables and service as you pull out through the backlog.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Chris, just Mike's looking for the number. But while he does, consumables aren't really impacted by that. There are sometimes, because we go through distribution, sometimes our distributors stock a little more, stock a little less, or the hospitals don't quite catch their seasonality correct. But that tends to be minor fluctuations. On the capital side, the 75-25 is roughly a good rule but we clearly – we had gone – it goes in cycles and we had been where replacement was the stronger piece a couple years ago. Projects have been picking up and they're continuing to pick up. So again, Mike's doing some math right now. I'll let him report it, but it's clearly picked up the last six months or eight months or so. And the outlook is also that way. There is more project kind of business out there.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Chris, we've gone from roughly 70-30 replacement versus projects and we're more looking like closer to now 60-40. So we made a pretty substantial switch with the replacement versus the projects.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly cash flow was strong, approximately $50 million in free here in the quarter. Can you just remind us if there's anything different in terms of the seasonality when we think about historically the way we saw corporate cash flow build through the course of the year now that this is going to be our first full year with Synergy? Thanks.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Chris, I would say that from a cash flow standpoint the seasonality will be tracking to income. And for the most part legacy STERIS has typically been more second-half weighted. Legacy Synergy has been pretty much even throughout the year. So I don't think it'll be that much of a directional change from what we've seen historically.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: AST generally is a little, all things being equal, there's growth across, but all things being equal AST tends to be stronger in the first half and Synergy was more AST-oriented. And the rest of STERIS has tended to be a little more back half, particularly the capital side. So it kind of mixes and matches. I would still expect it to be, generally speaking, for seasonality to have a little stronger in the back half, A., just due to the growth in general, and B., because the back half tends to be a little more weighted, particularly on the capital side.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Just one more for you guys. Walt and Mike, you sort of alluded to some of this through your comments, but could you talk a little bit about just how the integration of Synergy is going as you put those two businesses together? And then there was a little bit of confusion in last quarter's conference call as it related to the outlook for the cost synergies. I noticed that you indicated that you are looking for and still expecting $15 million for this year. But again help us think about the $40 million that you kind of initially targeted.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Larry. First, I would say there are basically three projects in this integration and each of the two major businesses that are integrated – the HSS/IMS business is one and the AST business from both sides, or formally Isomedix and AST business the other – the business integration for all intents and purposes is almost complete, that is the organization, structures and people and all those things. Those integration teams are down to just a few items, with the exception of the classic IT where we were trying to get on common systems and all that stuff, which is much more like the central office integration functions. But in terms of what I'll call the business salesforce, those kinds of things, we are coming into the home stretch if not in the home stretch, and it's gone nicely, just full stop nicely. The longer-term issues relate to systems, getting on common systems and getting on the back office people, whether that's human resources, IT, finance. Those systems take longer to integrate. And so those are I'll call it the long-tail systems, and that project team is still heavily working on their part of integration, not the least of which is things like legal, legal structure-type things because you know we had, I forgotten exactly, but 60 or 70 legal entities in our business and they had 60 or 70 legal entities in their business. You know, we would like to get to 60 or 70 legal entities. And that just takes time of lawyers and accountants and those kind of things. And it saves us money in the long run because we don't have to do 140 statutory reports. We do 60 or 70. And so those kinds of things are taking the time and that was always expected. Now, to come down to the bottom-line side of it. We hit our $5 million that we expected last year. We are very comfortable with our $15 million forecast for this year and we are very comfortable with our $40 million or more now total forecast over the longer period of time. And whether $2 million or $3 million of it slides into 2019 instead of 2018, my own view is we'll probably hit 2018 and have a little extra that we get maybe slide into 2019. But at a high level, any way you want to look at it we are quite comfortable with the numbers that we have in place.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, terrific, thanks very much, appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. I show no other question at this time. I'll turn the call back for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Alice, and thank you everybody for joining us this morning. We'll talk to you again soon.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the STERIS Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce today's host, Julie Winter, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Danica and good morning, everyone. On today's call as usual we have Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO and Michael Tokich, our Senior Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. I have just a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the express written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including without limitation those risk factors described in STERIS Plc's, STERIS Corporation's and Synergy's previous securities filings. Many of these important factors are outside of STERIS' control. No assurances can be provided as to any result or the timing of any outcome regarding matters described in this webcast or otherwise. The Company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. STERIS plc and STERIS Corporation SEC filings are available through the Company and on our website. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures that may be used from time to time during this call and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. STERIS' adjusted earnings per diluted share and segment operating income exclude the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, acquisition-related transaction costs, integration costs related to acquisitions and certain other unusual or nonrecurring items. We defined free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles, net capital expenditures plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment and intangibles. Additional information regarding adjusted earnings per diluted share, segment operating income and free cash flow is available in today's release. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Walt. To Mike, excuse me.
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie and good morning everyone. It is my pleasure once again to be with you this morning to review our adjusted financial results. Before I get into the numbers, let me remind you that all prior-year comparisons are to legacy STERIS unless otherwise noted in both mine and Walt's remarks. We're pleased to report revenue growth of 38% for the quarter. The increase in revenue was driven by the acquisition of Synergy Health, Black Diamond Video and GEPCO in addition to solid organic revenue growth. Constant currency organic revenue growth was 5% and was entirely driven by volume as price was neutral during the quarter. Foreign currency negatively impacted revenue by 1%. I want to spend some time this morning addressing gross margin as we have received a number of questions since reporting third quarter results. The addition of Synergy Health has caused overall STERIS gross margins to be lower than they were pre-deal. As we began to integrate Synergy, we found that they used a different policy to classify costs between cost of goods sold and SG&A as compared to legacy STERIS. We have applied the legacy STERIS four-walls approach which reports all costs directly and indirectly related to the delivery of products or services as cost of goods sold. This four-walls approach causes STERIS to include costs in our facilities that other companies may include in SG&A instead of cost of goods sold, for example, human resource personnel in a factory. As a result, some costs that Synergy would have previously reported as SG&A are now included in COGS and will be going forward. As integration continues, we may find that some additional costs need to be reassigned but believe we're generally consistent at these levels.  Importantly, these expense classifications have no impact on the overall bottom line profitability of our business. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter decreased 320 basis points as compared to last year to 39.3% which was about flat sequentially, year-over-year, Synergy negatively impacted gross margin by 500 basis points in the fourth quarter. Offsetting that, we had 90 basis points improvement from currency, 50 basis points improvement from the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and 30 basis points of improvement from lower material costs. SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the quarter declined 350 basis points to 18.4% of revenue, more than offsetting the change in gross margin as a percentage of revenue due mainly to Synergy Health. Now let's focus on EBIT margin. EBIT margin in the quarter increased 100 basis points to 18.8% of revenue. Revenue volume, favorable foreign currency, the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and lower R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue drove the improvement in EBIT margin. While we delivered an operationally sound quarter there was quite a bit of noise in our effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 34%. During the quarter we had a greater than anticipated percentage of our income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions like the U.S. which as you know has a higher effective tax rate as compared to the rest of the world. In addition, the quarterly tax rate was negatively impacted by the timing of discrete item adjustments primarily relating to the acquisition of Synergy Health. Both of these items more than offset the tax benefit received from the combination with Synergy. One example of a discrete item which negatively impacted the fourth quarter would be the establishment of FIN 48 tax reserves specifically for Synergy. FIN 48 tax reserves are reserves established for tax positions which are less than certain. During the quarter, we had to establish several FIN 48 reserves related to the activity associated with certain tax positions for which Synergy had taken prior to and after the close of the combination. Synergy appropriately followed IFRS accounting guidelines but not U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP specifically requires the establishment of these reserves for certain tax positions. As we look forward, we fully expect to achieve an effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the full fiscal year. Like always, this rate is subject to unforeseen changes in mix and discrete item adjustments. Net income for the quarter increased to $77.9 million or $0.90 per diluted share with 86.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. Moving on to segment results, our healthcare products segment revenue grew 5% in the quarter contributing to the revenue growth, consumable revenue increased 25% of which half was attributable to organic revenue growth. Our maintenance and installation service revenue grew 6% in the quarter. Capital equipment revenue declined 6% in the quarter with flat performance in the U.S. and declines in most other regions. We believe the performance of capital equipment revenue is a matter of timing as backlog ended the quarter at $119.4 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year. We have also begun to see an uptick in project orders which tend to have longer lead times than replacement orders. Operating margins for healthcare products were 18.1% of revenue in the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year due primarily to the increase in volume, favorable foreign currency and the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. Our healthcare specialty services segment reported revenue for the quarter of $157.9 million reflecting the addition of Synergy Health along with 10% organic revenue growth. Healthcare specialty services operating income increased to $6.5 million in the quarter due primarily to the increased volume. As anticipated, the addition of Synergy Health's hospital sterilization services and linen management businesses reduced the operating margins within this segment compared to the prior year. Applied Sterilization Technologies had a good quarter with $110.4 million of revenue. The increase in revenue was driven by the addition of Synergy Health and increased demand from our core medical device customers. Organic revenue in this segment was 8% for the quarter. Applied Sterilization Technologies operating margin was 34.8% of revenue, a meaningful increase compared to the prior year due primarily to the increase in volume, the addition of Synergy Health and a reduction in our asset retirement obligation. Life Sciences revenue grew 31% in the fourth quarter. Supporting that growth, consumable revenue grew 51% partly due to the acquisition of GEPCO and partly due to mid-teens organic revenue growth. In addition, Life Sciences service revenue grew 34% due to mid-teens organic revenue growth plus the addition of new service offerings. Last but not least, capital equipment revenue increased 8% in the quarter. Life Sciences total organic revenue growth was 11% in the fourth quarter. Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $45.3 million, about flat compared with the prior year. Life Sciences fourth quarter operating margin increased to 31.6% of revenue due to favorable mix shift towards consumables, an increase in volume and favorable currency. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $249 million of cash and approximately $1.6 billion in total debt. As we have previously stated, now that we have completed the combination with Synergy, we have added debt repayment to our list of capital allocation priorities. Barring no further M&A activity, we expect to reduce our debt to EBITDA over the next 18 to 24 months from approximately 2.7 to a level more consistent with STERIS' history. Our DSO is at 73 days at quarter one, an increase of nine days compared to last year. This increase is largely due to the impact of incorporating Synergy and other acquisitions we made over the past year into our DSO calculation. Our calculation includes 100% of in an acquisitions accounts receivable balance but only includes revenue since we have acquired them which somewhat overstates this measure. There is no material change in our AR exposure. Our free cash flow for fiscal 2016 exceeded our expectations. Free cash flow finished the year at $129.1 million. As we discussed last quarter, we had approximately $100 million of one-time cash expenses related to the combination with Synergy and other acquisitions as well as a pension contribution. So we generated approximately $229 million before paying these one-time expenses. Our free cash flow outlook of $250 million for fiscal 2017 includes approximately $50 million in additional cash expenses for the integration of Synergy Health mainly to capture the $15 million of cost synergies we have included in fiscal 2017. That leaves us with about $20 million in cost synergies remaining to capture beyond next year. Capital spending was $44.3 million in the quarter while depreciation and amortization was $55.2 million. Going forward, we anticipate that D&A will be approximately $145 million for the combined business and we would assume that our maintenance CapEx is at or slightly below that level. For fiscal 2017 specifically, we anticipate approximately $190 million of capital spending of which $50 million is for investment projects. We have a number of significant projects planned in fiscal 2017 including expansion projects or our AST business, an upgrade of our ERP system to the Oracle R12 platform and investments in R&D. Before I turn the call over to Walt, I want to spend a few moments on currency. When providing FX guidance, we utilize the average forward rates for our key currencies. Based on the 12-month forward rates as of March 31, 2016, we do not expect FX to have a net material financial impact on revenue or EBIT in fiscal 2017. In particular, the forward rates indicate that the U.S. dollar will strengthen versus both the pound and peso and weaken versus both the euro and Canadian dollar. As a combined company, we tend to like a strong euro and pound and a weak peso and Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2016 was an extraordinary year for STERIS and we're pleased to be with you discussing another record performance as a result of the collective contributions of our people. Even in the face of currency and market headwinds outside the United States, our business grew both organically and through strategic acquisitions to deliver 21% growth in revenue and record adjusted earnings per share of $3.39. Topping the year's achievements was the landmark completion of the Synergy Health combination in addition to closing two other strategic acquisitions, General Econopak and Black Diamond. At the same time, we grew organically as a result of our continued investment in product development and in manufacturing and service operations that enable us to bring improved products and services to our customers and the people whose health and safety they improve.  Full-year 2016 organic revenue growth for legacy STERIS was 5%, 6% in constant currency with growth in all four segments. In particular, our IMS business which is the legacy STERIS component of our new HSS segment delivered double-digit growth even as they settled into new combined sales territories. We also saw solid mid-single digit organic growth in our life science and AST segments which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Our healthcare products segment organic revenue grew 3% for the year with strong growth in the United States offsetting weakness outside the U.S. Synergy Health was a meaningful contributor to our overall growth in FY '16. On a constant currency basis, Synergy revenue grew 4% for the full year and adjusted operating profit grew 9%. Of course the impact of currency has had a negative impact on a U.S. dollar basis which made the U.S. dollar reported revenue decline low single digits and profit about flat for the year. As is always the case, some parts of the business are doing better than others. We're particularly pleased with the strength of the AST portion of the Company and believe the HSS business in the UK and Europe have good opportunity for continued growth and profitability. As we have said all along, the U.S. HSS business which is a long term growth opportunity for STERIS is a nascent business and will take time and investment to develop. While we continue to engage in conversations with customers about potential outsourcing opportunities, we believe there is substantial lead time before significant contracts will materially impact our business. The Northwell joint venture continues to experience project delays which have pushed back the anticipated opening. As a result, Northwell has not generated any significant revenue during the year and we have not included any revenue from Northwell in our fiscal 2017 outlook. We have a continuing strategic review of the company's businesses consistent with our ongoing review and determine the level of resources we will allocate to each of the businesses. Naturally we will discuss that with you further at the appropriate times. On the cost side related to the Synergy combination, we have generated approximately $5 million of Synergy in fiscal 2016 as planned and continue to expect that we will save an additional $15 million in fiscal 2017 and $20 million thereafter. As Mike mentioned, we will incur some additional costs as planned during this fiscal year to accomplish those overall synergies. Diving into the segments a bit further, healthcare products grew 6% for the year in total with contributions from Black Diamond and Synergy Health and a low single-digit organic revenue growth. Capital equipment in healthcare products increased low single digits for the year driven by double-digit growth in the U.S. which was offset by declines in all other regions. Newer capital products that contributed to the year include a new AMSCO washer line, Harmony lights and booms or the Vision tables and V-PRO 60. Healthcare product consumable revenue climbed low double digits with organic revenue making up more than half of that growth. We saw healthy increases for consumables in the major geographic regions other than the EMEA. The Middle East in particular reflects lower revenue due to the current macroeconomic issues in the region and follows particularly strong consumable orders in the prior year. Our instrument cleaning chemistries, V-PRO dedicated chemistries and new product portfolio for U.S. endoscopy all saw solid improvements this year. Service revenue grew mid-single digits driven by the strength in the U.S. and Latin America. The healthcare specialty service segment grew 70% in the year with strong organic growth bolstered by the addition of the two businesses from Synergy, hospital sterilization services and linen management services. Our strong organic revenue growth was produced by IMS, our instrument repair business. IMS's double-digit revenue growth was fueled by several large contract wins as well as our ability to capitalize on shorter term engagements that arose during the year. Moving on to our life science business, this business just had an outstanding year with 18% revenue growth, about one-third of which was organic. We completed the purchase of GEPCO last summer and that has been a strategic addition to our portfolio which capitalized on our global field support of our pharmaceutical customers. We believe the addition of these product lines strengthen our position around the globe. Even in the face of economic headwinds outside the U.S., all three life science product areas capital, consumables and service experienced organic growth last year and all life science geographic regions grew as well. Operating margins for life science continued to expand benefiting from the increase in volume and favorable mix. AST grew 51% for the year with 7% organic revenue growth and the previously discussed contribution from Synergy. The integration of our people, Synergy and STERIS is complete and the business is being run by the appropriate STERIS and Synergy people. Combined, we have a network of 59 facilities in 16 countries around the globe in which our customers rely on us to sterilize over 1 billion medical products each year. We continue to be excited about the opportunities ahead of this combined organization and if anything, we have been conservative in our original thinking. We're working on a number of facility expansions that will facilitate our ability to meet anticipated customer demand. In the United States, we're extending radiation in Southern California and Chester, New York and recently opened an additional facility in Northern California. We're also modifying our plant in Temecula, California to allow small volume ETO processing which better matches the demand in that region. In Europe, we're expanding radiation capacity in Ireland and the UK and ethylene oxide in the Netherlands. Our European expansions will begin to impact growth in fiscal year 2018. Switching gears now to profitability, total company EBIT improved 30% year-over-year due to the inclusion of our new businesses, our organic volume growth, favorable currency and our cost reduction efforts. We did have increased interest expense and a higher share count impacting earnings per share, some of which was offset by the lower tax rate for the year. All in all, we're pleased with our organic achievements as well as the businesses that have joined the STERIS family which allowed us to post another year of record results in fiscal 2016 and more importantly, provides a springboard for an anticipated fifth consecutive year of record performance in fiscal 2017. Last week we held our beginning of the year business meetings with our newly combined field sales and operations forces in healthcare, life sciences and AST. I have to say I have never seen the STERIS field organization more excited about what lies ahead in both the near term and long term future for STERIS. They understand the powerful combination of products and services we can bring to our customers in hospitals, pharma and medical devices. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue growth to be in the range of 25% to 26% with growth in all four segments. Of that, approximately 7% will be organic revenue growth. For your modeling purposes, we expect revenue for the legacy Synergy business in the range of $640 million to $650 million for the year reflecting low single-digit growth over the course of the year. We're clearly looking for expansion of EBIT margins year-over-year for the total Company even with an increase in R&D as we plan to reinvest the Medical Device Excise Tax savings in FY '17 in product development and production predominantly in the United States. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share are anticipated to be in the range of $3.85 to $4.00 for the full fiscal year. For your modeling purposes, we expect our first half, second half split to be approximately the same as this past year at about 44% in the first half and 56% in the second half. As we said in the release, our forecast presumes that changes in foreign currency do not have a material impact on fiscal 2017 financial results. We anticipate that the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings will be approximately 25% next year. We ended the year with a solid balance sheet having secured favorable refinancing of our debt in conjunction with closing the Synergy Health deal. Our leverage is higher than it has been in the past but well within ranges we're comfortable with and dropping. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities, maintaining and growing our dividend, investing for organic growth, targeting acquisitions in adjacent product and market areas, reducing our leverage and finally, share repurchases if other uses of cash are lower than our desires and do not offset dilution. To be clear, our guidance for fiscal 2017 assumes no EPS dilution due to share count increase as well as no M&A activity. We have made meaningful progress in achieving our strategic goals over the past several years and it is remarkable to look back at all our people have achieved in just this past year, expanding strategically through acquisition while performing well organically. We have been and will continue to look across our business portfolio for opportunities to continue to optimize our products and services. We believe the future for STERIS is bright indeed. As always, we appreciate your continued support and your time this morning. I will hand the call back over to Julie for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. Danica, would you please give the instructions for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Lawrence Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] in for Larry. Just a couple of quick questions, first I guess on the EPS guidance, could you walk us through some of the key puts and takes from fiscal 2016 bridging to fiscal 2017? Obviously I think the key buckets would be cost synergies which you have called out, BDV and GEPCO accretion which you had talked about previously and then incremental sales for Synergy. So could you help kind of walk us through those different pieces? So that is my first question.
Walt Rosebrough: We don't get in that level of detail on the specific components. But you are absolutely correct that I will call it the big buckets and it is largely driven by both the revenue and profitability we bring over with the acquisition. So we have significant increase in profitability as a result of bringing Synergy over for a full year instead of half year. GEPCO also, we have not a full-year in last year's earnings so we bring across those buckets. The synergies from Synergy or the increased profitability due to Synergy on the cost side alone we do expect another roughly $15 million of earnings as a result of those cost reductions. And I think those are probably the biggest pieces other than the natural growth in the business which we have said we have about 7% organic growth then we typically and will this year grow our profitability more than our organic growth rates as a result of that growth.  Having said that, there are some places that we're clearly investing, we're investing more in R&D. That largely is offset by the Medical Device Excise Tax this year. We're clearly growing some nascent businesses so we're investing in those businesses. And then you have to take into account last year we did not have a full-year impact of the total share count that we had this year and of course, we have a greater interest rate as a result of bringing those businesses on. I think if we think through those buckets that way, that is the big chunks.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just turning to the healthcare products segment, capital did come in a little bit lighter than we would have anticipated so I guess number one, how would you characterize the current utilization environment as it relates to capital purchasing in surgical volumes? Number two, could you help us break apart the comments around the impact of level loading of shipments and then perhaps some areas where you have seen international weakness? Thank you.
Walt Rosebrough: Good questions and I think there are two or three questions embedded. I will try to answer them one at a time. Generally speaking, capital came in about where we expected it to for the year and it was offset if you will, the U.S. business came in quite strong and double-digit and maybe even pretty strong double-digit increases across those areas. And then of course with the acquisition of Blank Diamond, even more. So we like our capital business in the U.S. Globally, capital has shrunk for us and almost everybody that is in the business and you guys look at the other people as well. So we have a difficult year globally both as a result of the economic, the general economies which push the governments then which push their spending on healthcare as well as the currency, the dollar strengthening vis-a-vis almost every major currency. And then we had particular weak spots and one that comes to mind is the Middle East which has struggled mightily just as a result of the collapse of oil pricing as well as them having to fund more based activity. As a result, they have less funding for healthcare-based activity. So that at a high level, that is pretty much it. What is different and we think it is better, an improvement, is we were able this year to much better match our production planning and shipping activities such that our business was more level loaded if you will across the year. Now you saw some of that, we did with inventory so we increased our inventory over the course of the year anticipating some significant shipments in the third and fourth quarter. We did see those in the third and fourth quarter but we did not have nearly the quote unquote spike in the fourth quarter that we have had some times and we like not having that spike that allows our operations to run more effectively and efficiently. We're hopeful we can continue down that path keeping it at least at the level we did this year and maybe even better. So you didn't see a fourth quarter spike and that is also reflected in the backlog. If you would look at our backlog, you will see that our backlog is greater at the end of this year than it was at the end of last year, significantly greater, I think something on the order of $20 million and that is a function of two things. One us level loading that and not shipping as much of the backlog during the fourth quarter and having more in the second and third. And the second is we have seen an increase in our project, major project kind of work and that tends to fluctuate. We talk about that all of the time. It kind of fluctuates up and down. Right now we have more project work as a percent of the total and project work has longer leadtimes than does routine replacement and so that tends to lengthen the backlog. I think I have answered most of that in terms of most of the questions you've ask and that one good question. And in that, the last component is our outlook and we still see in the U.S. significant positive outlook. I wouldn't call it high growth rates but on the other hand, it is not shrinking and in fact we have had now several months in a row, maybe now even several quarters in a row where we have seen increased activity in the field so the pipeline looks good and our orders have reflected that. And that again is why you saw the increased backlog at the end of the year. So we feel comfortable with the go forward look in the U.S. Outside the U.S., it is a much more difficult environment and we do not believe we have seen significant change. There are difficulties in much of the economies in Latin America, all the mineral based or oil-based economies are having difficulty in the Middle East is difficult. We have actually seen improvement in our business in mainland Europe and so there have been some improvement there for us. And then Asia-Pacific seems to be coming back some but again they face struggles in those economies that are dominated by either oil or by minerals.
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.
Jason Rodgers: Very strong performance in life sciences and especially with the margins and just wondering how we should think about that segment going forward given the margins are well above your longer term target of 20%?
Walt Rosebrough: As I have expressed on many occasions, I don't have really what I would call a margin target per se. I generally speaking do not like seeing things that are under 15% and over 20%, I start thinking about whether or not we're investing appropriately or working appropriately. But we don't have a cap on margin and we don't have a minimum. Our job is to try to improve them and create the margins we can create. We have tremendous value creation capabilities in the life science space and those margins are reflecting that. They are also reflecting a mix shift, another mix shift which we have been shifting over the years significantly which is why the margins have improved to the consumable business. And then of course, GEPCO is an entirely consumable business so we saw another step function up in that mix shift. So I would not characterize that we're trying to move our margins down to 20%. So we will continue to do the best we can on the production side, the operations side and develop new products that are good for our customers and charge the appropriate prices for that and as a result create value for them which creates value for us. We do, I mentioned earlier on our cost reductions and on product development, we do always try to pass some portion of that back to our customers because we think that is the appropriate thing to do for the long term.  So it is not like every dollar we save we put in our pockets, every dollar we say we either put back into R&D, put it into price, get value creation in price for ourselves or value creation and price reduction for our customers. It is a combination of those things.
Jason Rodgers: And was there anything one-time in nature that drove that mid-teens organic growth rate in life sciences?
Walt Rosebrough: The only thing I would say different, obviously you have the GEPCO acquisition so you have to put the acquisition into the mix but the balances of the -- so there is an organic, inorganic component. So the inorganic component popped it up significantly, but they just had good, strong growth and you know that we have historically struggled in capital and capital also grew so we had I will call it the normal growth I will use the word normal loosely because they had good growth in both service and in consumables. But we also saw growth in capital which does not always happen.
Jason Rodgers: And then finally looking at the HSS segment with the margins off year-over-year to the low single digits, how should we be thinking about that segment as far as margin improvement for the upcoming fiscal year?
Walt Rosebrough: Obviously that is an area of opportunity for us in terms of margin improvement. And since I have already told you I don't like things necessarily under 15 and I start thinking about them over 20, we will be working to improve those margins. But that is a mixed business, there is laundry in that or the historic linen business and synergies in there. There is historic business that was purchased in the U.S. and there is a nascent business we're trying to grow in the U.S. So it is a mixed bag. We do anticipate improving those margins over the course of time but part of that is we want to make sure we don't under invest in the growth parts of that business. So it is a mixed bag. I will call it ongoing businesses have objectives to improve their margins, some of which is volume, some of which is growth, cost improvement that comes along with growth but we're also making investments in those businesses as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Matt Mishan: Let's just start off with you did a 5% underlying constant currency growth for core STERIS but what was the pro forma constant currency growth including Synergy Health? And then you also said that Synergy Health us plus 4% on a constant currency basis for the full-year. What was it in the quarter?
Michael Tokich: We're not going to get into that much detail in Synergy. We gave the year because in total we had a lot of pressure in the fourth quarter to provide a number and we felt that giving the year was probably the best perspective that we could get. So I would say the quarter would be no more or less than the year so it would be similar in that regards.
Walt Rosebrough: And pro forma is a difficult term because as you know, in the last five months we have been mixing and matching STERIS and Synergy and it is difficult enough for us to determine what is Old Synergy and Old STERIS that we changed our bonus program in the last three months of the year because we don't feel like we can make those determinations cleanly enough and when there is a cost reduction as a result of Synergy, is that Old Synergy or Old STERIS? When there is revenue growth as a result of us working together, is that Old Synergy, Old STERIS? The answer is we don't know. But orders of magnitude as best we can give you, we have given you the STERIS legacy business and orders of magnitude, we have given you the Synergy legacy business growth rates, total sizes in growth rates and the number for next year, legacy Synergy although there are two reasons there is a range there. One is there is always a range in forecasting and the other is it is getting harder and harder for us to tell what is Synergy and what is STERIS which is a good thing, that is the power of putting the businesses together.
Matt Mishan: I think that is fair. Maybe I will try to ask it in a different way. It looks like AST was exceptional in the quarter and then it also looks like IMS as part of your HSS Group now is doing really well. Is something going on with the other pieces of HSS, the linens business, the hospital sterilization services that is maybe driving some lower growth? Can you talk a little bit about that?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. I think you correctly captured the general direction that we have tried to lay out for you for the business as you described. On the HSS business as I said, we do think -- I'm going to separate HSS Europe which is largely UK but also has some European component and the HSS business U.S. So the HSS business in Europe is a well-established, strong growing business. We think there is good upside opportunity for both growth and profit growth in a strong business. There is always some trade-offs in timing and current right now -- currency is not helping us because since that is an all inside the UK or inside Europe or largely inside the UK Europe business and the pound has been strong for those two, that has hurt us on a reported basis. But we do think there is opportunity for growth in both those businesses and it is more routine type of work. In the U.S. there is an acquisition, acquired businesses in the U.S. and those businesses are some pieces that we think are good and some pieces that are clearly not having the kind of returns that we would want them to have and we will work to improve those. And then we have this, for lack of a better term, nascent business that is just getting started and we're investing more into that than we're getting back out of it. And that is normal in a startup kind of a business. So when you put all of that together, I think that is a good description of those businesses and we do anticipate improving the profitability of those businesses and growing revenue in those businesses probably more in later years than in earlier years, but that is our thinking at that point in time. I think in the linen businesses are also in this segment and as is often the case, that is a tale of two cities. And Dr. Steeves, if you look back at his comments over the course of the years, it seems like one year or two or three, the UK business was stronger. And one year, two or three, the Netherlands business was stronger. And clearly in this case, the UK business had a strong year and the Netherlands business had a tough year and as you have heard from Dr. Steeves, I think the last year or two, the Netherlands business there is overcapacity in the space and we're working to reduce our costs appropriately and manage that appropriately but that is a tough business right now.
Matt Mishan: And just a follow-up to that and then I will have one more on tax and then I will jump off. We heard a couple of companies talk about delays in the UK specifically around their National Health Services and some funding there. Did you seeing any of that in the quarter, is there anything UK specific around that business that may be impacting growth in the near term?
Walt Rosebrough: We didn't see any significant change in our business model or businesses if you will in the UK in the Synergy space and because that tends to be a turn business if you will, it is a consumable kind of a business, you don't tend to have as much fluctuation in that as you might some other things. Now we have seen some delays in timing in terms of working on new projects and signing up projects as there have been changes in NHS so there has been that kind of a delay. But that does not really affect us on a routine basis so in the quarter we didn't see anything significant.
Matt Mishan: And then just lastly on the tax rate, can you provide some additional detail or quantify a little bit how you get to 34 from 25? Was this a surprise for you and what gives you confidence that you are going to be able to do the 25% in FY '17 especially with the U.S. remaining very strong and the international being kind of weak?
Michael Tokich: Matt, as it turns out we were somewhat optimistic in our forecast as we had anticipated that the favorability in the tax rate that we were experiencing through the third quarter would continue and obviously you know that it did not. In addition, we had the geographic mix and the negative impact of discrete item adjustments or the timing of the discrete item adjustments which we had underestimated their impact on the rate for the quarter. Part of those discrete items as I gave you an example earlier about the FIN 48, I mean that was just a natural process we were going through in integrating Synergy as we were doing balance sheet, detailed balance sheet reviews. And obviously with them being on IFRS and now transitioning to U.S. GAAP, there were some variances in the tax rate reserves that we needed to record and needed to record when we had discovered those. So we really didn't have any opportunity to move those out. It was really recognize those and put the reserves on when they were discovered. I can tell you that since November 2, we have obtained the tax benefits from the combination with Synergy and these items that we talked about, the discrete items specifically and also the geographic mix having a full-year of Synergy and understanding their tax positions going into the full-year, we're as confident as ever that the 25% rate will be withstood in fiscal year 2017.
Walt Rosebrough: Matt, I would argue we will see a bit more variability in our tax rate over the course of the year because these things don't -- just the way taxes are recognized, we may get some variation quarter to quarter. And as a result both of what you are asking the mix issues because we're much better at forecasting what we will sell in general geographic regions or in countries for a year than for a quarter and we're terrible at forecasting it for a month. It gets harder and harder as you move down because again, our turn business tends to be more stable but our capital business can move pretty significantly. What we do is when if we're building product it is pretty easy to shift if we're a little light in I will just say the UK and we have shipments for the UK but we can ship that to the U.S. or vice versa, we do that. And so even though that hits our total numbers correctly on an operating profit, it will shift our tax rates from quarter to quarter or month to month. But on an annual basis, we will be much better at that than we -- where we don't have to phase it, time it and all those things we did this past year.
Matt Mishan: And I'm just as sorry to all of the people behind me but can you quantify what the impact of the discrete tax adjustments were, like what the dollar amount was so people can back those out? Then I'm done.
Michael Tokich: The problem with that, Matt, is we have discrete item adjustments almost every quarter and we're not going to get into that level of detail. I mean they are not always negative. In Q2 this year we had a large positive discrete item adjustment which favorably impacted the tax rate. We're not going to book keep those, we're going to book keep the total adjusted tax rate on an external basis only.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Cooley of Stephens. Your line is open.
Chris Cooley: Walt and Mike, could you maybe help us out? When we think about the capital component in healthcare products during the quarter, you saw a 6% decline. Could you maybe help us characterize the differences that you see in not only the size of the average order quantity but also in the lead time when you see this shift from basically a replacement to a new build or a major product? And help us think about how that played into the fourth quarter and also maybe then been bracket that with international softness and just or maybe weakness in general. Just want to make sure we fully understand what we saw in the fourth quarter and then how that plays through here in the first part of 2017. Then I've got a couple of follow-ups as well.
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. First of all, Chris, hopefully I tried to at least answer a portion of that question. We saw our backlog increase roughly $20 million in the quarter year-over-year quarter so that gives you an order of magnitude of the change. So obviously our orders grew $20 million more than our shipments for the year so for a yearly change that gives you that view. Secondly, as Mike mentioned or Mike or I both I think mentioned, we have seen somewhat of a shift and this shift happens, it is not an infrequent happening, it happens all the time between major projects, things where we're selling $0.5 million or bigger projects at a time versus individual orders. I would not say that those orders independently have changed size significantly. That is the project orders are staying roughly the same size and the replacement orders are staying roughly the same size. It is just we have seen a shift to more of those project orders. And Mike, I think you may have the details on that.
Michael Tokich: We started seeing that about -- this is the second quarter in a row we have actually seen that shift which is obviously one of the reasons we're actually seeing the increase in backlog in addition to the level loading. So we're on about a two quarter trajectory at this point in time and that we made the note of it because it is at this point a change that we have not seen for probably the last year or so.
Walt Rosebrough: And then a follow-on on the international things, we're actually seeing some improvement in the pipeline in international but we think it is a little early to call it success so we're being cautious there. But it at least seems that we have hit the bottom in international in general and now so we're seeing some positive things in the pipeline but we're not ready to declare victory there yet. We do have some increases in our international business in our plan but they are modest in scope.
Chris Cooley: On the guidance for fiscal 2017, I think you stated you expect Synergy to contribute between $640 million to $650 million or low single-digit growth in the fiscal year. Can you maybe just walk us through what is behind that low single-digit growth when we think about Synergy? It seems just a little bit softer than what historically we have seen from that business and just want to make sure I understand how much is a function of the merger and then how much maybe softer international in-market demand. Just walk us through kind of why we should think about low single-digit growth for the coming year?
Walt Rosebrough: There is obviously currency effect. I want to hold that aside, it is not a big, big number but there is a currency effect. The second component is we're continuing to see the kind of growth rates we have and would expect to see in the AST business in the high single-digit kind of numbers both on the Synergy side and on the STERIS side or now you really have to characterize it as both on the U.S. business and the O-U.S. business. So we're seeing that kind of growth and expect to continue to see that for the long term which is why we're investing in growth capacity in those businesses. In the linen business, we're not seeing that, we're seeing growth in the UK and actually shrinkage in the Netherlands side of the business so that is not a trivial piece of the business. And then in the HSS business again, there is the growth in the UK international piece. We have seen a bit of a slowdown, we do not think that in any way is integration related. We think it is just the nature of the business at this point in time. We do expect to see that growth rate pick up over time back to more traditional levels. When you go to in the U.S., we're clearly going to be sorting between some of those businesses that is not as that is not as profitable as we would like and the businesses that are more profitable than we would like. And so just like we have in the past for example in life science, sometimes it is better to shrink a little to grow your profit a little and we're going to be doing that so we can invest appropriately for the growth business that we see as a possibility on the U.S. side. I think at a high level that is the answer. I don't think there is any significant disruption if you will as a result of the integration going forward. I think it is absolutely fair to say for both companies that the 15 months we spent trying to figure out if we would get to come together clearly created -- we were both running two plans, what if we do and what if we don't? And so in those businesses where there is more interaction both the AST business and the HSS businesses, there was some slow down or you had to do two things instead of one thing and so that 15 months we might have lost a little bit of ground on both sides of the business but I don't think it is significant and I don't think it will play significantly going forward. So it is not something that gives me great concern.
Chris Cooley: Just one more if I may, then I will get back into the queue. When we look at the guidance for fiscal 2017 in the aggregate, definitely some strong topline implications there, 7% organic growth, cash flow of 250 inclusive of the incremental spend also very encouraging. You are roughly 5-ish plus months into the merger now. Could you just give us maybe a quick state of the union as to how you see the opportunity with Synergy Health? What is there that you thought was there at the time of the proposed merger and maybe what incrementally have you discovered from both maybe a growth and a cost standpoint now that you have had a chance to get a little bit more aggressively into the merger itself? Thank you.
Walt Rosebrough: Maybe I will walk three steps, try to break it into three questions. One, the cost synergies. Two, what we see in the major chunks of the business and three, any differences in our views. First, on the cost synergies, they always come out different from where they are than what we think but they are still coming out to the same number. So whether it is this department or that department or this item or that item, we continue to feel that the $40 million is achievable. I personally feel that may even be a little light if you give us a little longer time but we feel the $40 million is achievable. Timing may not be exactly perfect and I will come back to the why on that a little bit. The $20 million from this year and from last year let's call it and this year in total we fully expect that we will achieve that so we're not concerned about that at all. The next years' worth, if some of it slid a little bit, it wouldn't surprise us.  We're getting into finding out that more and more, as is often the case a lot of central office type stuff is IT related and you can only do so many IT things at once. And so we may have some delay in 2018 or 2019 but we're not talking significant numbers in our view at this point in time so we're not concerned about that at all. Again, we do feel that we achieved the $40 million -- my personal expectation is we do a little better. So now moving on to that topic in terms of the three big buckets of integration, the first is I will call it the central office kind of stuff, the relatively easy things that we have done and it is behind us and that is quick. The longer term central office things are clearly more IT related and it is just work and they were anticipated taking longer time, they were all put out in the 2018 time period and they were predominantly put out any 2018 time period. But there is a lot of work and we're going to work through it. We think we will get there, no big surprises, no big deal but it might take us a little bit longer than we anticipated. I will call it the two major business components, quite clearly the AST business that I have already indicated it was in my view and always has been my view that it was the easier integration in that basically you had a U.S. business and an O-U.S. business. The people in the businesses have known each other, we have not been competitors and so they've known each other for a long time, they go to the same conferences, they do the same things. So many of our people knew many of their people fairly well and we have a long term leader in that business, Dan Carestio, who has been in our business for a long, long time, 15 to 16 years. I may not be quite right but I'm close and so that is going I think very well. I think the upside there is even greater than we anticipated. On the HSS business, clearly the laundry issues in the Netherlands that Richard Steeves has talked about now for a year or two is clearly there and we think it will continue and we have work to do to improve that. And then in the U.S. business, I have always felt that there is different people's views on how that is going to go. I have always talked the nascent business I have always felt it is going to take time and I do still believe it is going to take time to have a material impact on the business, but I think it is a very, very nice potential long term opportunity so I don't know that there is a change there but clearly in terms of my view, it is very similar. I'm trying to think through if there is anything else of significance in those three. So if I were a betting person, the AST business probably gets a little quicker start than we might have thought and does a little better in the long term. The HSS business I think will do as well as we thought but it is going to take a little longer than we thought. But orders of magnitude hopefully it will be in the same ranges. And then the currency, probably the biggest issue is currency changed on us. It was 18 months or now almost two years ago when we were putting this thing together and when we did the deal, the currency clearly changed on us. The good news is that the deal was constructed in such a way that we paid a cash portion in pounds so we had a partial hedge against that currency change but that has clearly had an effect when you go through the operating segment. But high-level, that is it. I think as large integration goes, this one is going about as well as one should expect.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Mit Ramgopal of Sidoti. Your line is open.
Mit Ramgopal: Most of my questions have been answered but I just have two quick ones. Mike, I know you talked about maybe deleveraging the balance sheet a little. I just wanted to get a sense in terms of the priorities for cash load if it is debt reduction and is it safe to roll out potential acquisitions?
Michael Tokich: Yes, I would say that our priorities for cash remain the same as Walt talked about earlier; dividends, reinvesting in our organic business, M&A if the opportunity does exist or does come forthright. Obviously we have had a little hiatus on doing any type of M&A activity but the pipeline is still strong and we're probably getting a little more active as we have Synergy under our belt now for the last five months. And then debt repayment, as we have talked about, we have added that into our prioritization and again as I spoke earlier, we're at about 2.7 times debt to EBITDA and barring any other large M&A opportunities or acquisitions, we would think that over the next 18 to 24 months we would get that back down to more of a STERIS historic level. And then obviously since we have included no dilution and assume no dilution and our FY '17 plan, if nothing else we would try and recoup some of that dilution by potentially repurchasing some shares.
Mit Ramgopal: Quickly on the CapEx, your $190 million now for fiscal 2017, I don't if you have a sense as to what we should expect going forward in terms of a more normalized CapEx?
Michael Tokich: I would say that our combined depreciation and amortization is around $145 million, $150 million. Obviously we have a significant amount of investments this year. Those investments as you know and you have followed us for quite some time, we tend to over invest one year, under invest the next. So I would say again for modeling purposes, I would still use that $150 million-ish as a good guide in total.
Operator: Thank you. I show no other questions at this time. I will turn the call back for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Great. Thanks everybody for joining us. Have a great day and go Cavs.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

With those cautious, I will hand the call over to Walt.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Julie and good morning everyone. Well, we are off to a good start as the new STERIS with the strong first two months of the combined company. We were together just a little over a month ago, discussing the combination and our forecast for the balance of the year. So this morning, I would like to spend some time on our integration efforts with Synergy. After I'm finished, Mike will review the solid financial performance for the quarter. Our integration efforts are progressing well in the first 90 days. In particular, we've achieved a number of significant milestones. We have made the senior leadership changes to restructure the combined business. We have aligned the leadership for our Global AST business and have rolled out the new brand name for that business to our customers STERIS AST replacing both Isomedix and Synergy AST. We've combined our North American IMS and Synergy HHS sales forces and operation teams in the new STERIS HS business. We have begun to in source our instrument cleaning and sterility assurance products into the Synergy HSS facilities. We have finalized and introduced our new reporting segments and we have started the planning and begun some work to put our central back office functions together. You will recall that we have set a target of $5 million in cost savings for this fiscal year 2016, which we are on track to achieve. This number is still anticipated to grow to about $40 million annualized run rate savings over the next two years. And we have attained the anticipated run rate tax benefits of the synergy combination. All of these efforts have required substantial time and attention from our people, both historic STERIS and Synergy, but we have continued to perform as anticipated in the base businesses of both companies. As we said on our December call, our people are focused on execution. We have much work ahead of us, but we are off to a good start and remain confident about what our two companies can do together. As you know, this is our first quarter reporting under our new segment formats and we know that many of are working on building new models. If you have not already, please see the table we included in our financials in the earnings release. This table provides historical revenue data for Synergy Health going back six quarters, broken out to align with our new reporting segments. Given the complexities of the currencies involved, we have not converted their revenue to U.S. dollars. As we stated on the call in December, we will not have truly clean year-over-year comparisons until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. As we look to finalize fiscal year 2016, we are reiterating the outlook provided on our December call, which includes revenue growth of 21% to 22% and adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.48 to $3.55. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 27.5%. Given our third quarter performance, we are increasingly comfortable with our range for the year. Free cash flow is anticipated to be a $100 million, reflecting about a $100 million in acquisition and integration expenses. Mike will discuss our cash flow forecast further in his presentation. After these first few months of the Synergy combination and the performance of our base businesses and other recent acquisitions, I continue to be more excited than ever about the future of our company. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike to discuss our financial results for the quarter.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our adjusted third quarter financial results. Before I get into the numbers, let me remind you that all prior year comparisons are to legacy STERIS. As Walt mentioned, we do not have pro forma data, and as a result are not able to comment on our performance on a year-over-year comparative pro forma basis. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, with revenue growth of 31%. The increase in revenue was driven by the acquisition of Synergy Health and solid organic revenue growth. Constant currency organic revenue growth was 7%, with 6% coming from volume and 1% from pricing. Foreign currency negatively impacted revenue by 1%, or approximately $7.3 million. Gross margin, as a percent of revenue for the quarter, decreased 240 basis points to 39.3%. We are not overly concerned with gross margin percent, as we're still working with Synergy to ensure that their costs are being recorded and mapped the same as ours. That said, Synergy was negative to gross margin in the quarter. In addition, we had a negative mix impact offsetting favorable currency and pricing. As you know, we focus more on EBIT margin, which increased 110 basis points to 17.4% of revenue. Revenue volume, favorable foreign currency impact and lower R&D expenses as a percentage of sales drove the 110 basis point improvement in EBIT margin. Foreign currency was favorable to EBIT by approximately $7.2 million in the quarter. Clearly, once we anniversary the Synergy Health combination, our FX exposure on a year-over-year comparative basis will shift, causing our revenue to be more sensitive to fluctuations in currency than legacy STERIS, but causing our bottom line to be less sensitive to fluctuations in currency versus legacy STERIS. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9%. As we experienced the immediate benefit of the Synergy acquisition plus several favorable discrete item adjustments including the renewal of the tax extenders, which was contemplated in our guidance and will not repeat at the same level in the fourth quarter. Net income increased substantially to $76.2 million or $0.98 per diluted share. With $77.7 million weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter. Moving on to our segment results, our Healthcare products segment revenue grew 10% in the quarter as we experienced solid organic revenue growth of 5% in addition to the acquisition of Synergy Health. Contributing to that revenue growth, consumable revenue increased 15%, capital equipment revenue increased 12% and our maintenance and installation service revenue grew 3%. We continue as we have all year to experience strong growth in the United States offset by weakness internationally within this segment. Healthcare Products backlog, at the end of the quarter, was $144.6 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Operating margins for Healthcare Products were 16.4% of revenue in the quarter, an increase of 150 basis points year-over-year, due primarily to the increase in volume and favorable foreign currency. Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment reported revenue for the quarter of $128.3 million, reflecting the addition of Synergy Health, along with 4% organic revenue growth. Healthcare Specialty Services operating income increased to $7.4 million in the quarter, due primarily to the increased volume. As anticipated, the addition of Synergy Health's hospital sterilization services and linen management businesses reduced the operating margins within this segment as compared to the prior year. Life Sciences revenue grew 22% in the third quarter, supporting that growth, consumable revenue grew 45%, partly due to the acquisition of GEPCO and partly due to growth in organic consumable revenue. In addition, Life Sciences service revenue grew 13%, while capital equipment revenue increased 8%. Life Sciences organic revenue grew 9% in the quarter. Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $45.4 million, an increase of 4% compared with the prior year. Life Sciences third quarter operating margin increased to 29.2% of revenue, due to a favorable mix shift toward consumables, an increase in volume and favorable foreign currency. Applied Sterilization Technologies also had a good quarter, with $90.2 million in revenue. The increase in revenue was driven by the addition of Synergy Health and increased demand from our core medical device customers. Applied Sterilization Technologies' operating margin was 29.7% of revenue, an increase of 220 basis points as compared to the prior year, due primarily to the increase in volume and the addition of Synergy Health. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $231 million of cash and $1.6 billion in debt. As we have previously stated, now that we have completed the combination with Synergy, we have added debt repayment to our list of capital allocation priorities. Barring any further acquisitions, we expect to reduce our debt-to-EBITDA from its current 2.8 times to a level more consistent with STERIS' history during the next 18 months to 24 months. Our DSO is at 76 days at quarter end, an increase of 16 days compared to last year. This increase is largely due to the impact of incorporating Synergy Health and other acquisitions we made over the past year into our DSO calculation. Our calculation includes 100% of an acquisition's accounts receivable, but revenue only since we've acquired them. There is no material change in our AR exposure. Our free cash flow for the first nine months was $22.9 million, a decline from $109.3 million last year. This is an unusual year for free cash since we do not adjust this measure like we do EBIT. We are seeing declines primarily due to significant expenses related to the combination with Synergy and other acquisitions. In addition, free cash flow was reduced by an increased payout level for the company's prior-year annual compensation program and a pension contribution made in connection with the settlement of a legacy pension obligation. The total of these items represents approximately $85 million of the year-over-year decline. It appears there is some confusion as to our forecast for free cash flow for the fiscal year. There is no change in the underlying cash expectation for the year. Our December free cash flow forecast was incorrect and only included actual year-to-date acquisition and integration expenses, which is why we are changing our forecasted free cash flow amount from $155 million to $100 million. However, if we were to look at free cash flow on an adjusted basis, which we have chosen not to do, our adjusted free cash flow remains the same at approximately $200 million. The adjustments are primarily related to cash expenses this year, for acquisition and integration costs of Synergy Health including investment and advisor fees, legal fees, tax advisory fees, make-whole payments for the payoff of Synergy's private placement notes, excise tax gross-up payments and integration expenses. All of these costs are in line with what we had identified in the S-4, as part of the cost to complete the combination with Synergy. Capital spending was $42.2 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $44.8 million. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Julie to begin the Q&A portion of the call.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. Ron, if you could please give the instructions for Q&A, we can open the lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you, speakers. Speakers, our first question is from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Sir, your line is open.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thank you very much. Good morning, Walt, Mike, Julie.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Matt.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. I just wanted to start off with you've maintained your sales and EPS guidance versus your December call. I was hoping you can go through some of the puts and the takes to that guidance. Obviously, I think the quarter was a little bit better than I would have thought. And then you also have the impact of the pound, which I think is a little bit worse then you guys have previously forecasted?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Yeah. I would say, Matt, the biggest change for us is the favorable tax rate. We were anticipating more of a normalized 25%-ish tax rate. We actually came in just under 22%, so that's about a $0.03 or $0.04 change. And as we talked about the – we did have the tax extenders in there, we also had some other favorable discrete item adjustments, such as Section 199 deductions, which we were not anticipating. So it is more, I guess of a timing issue, obviously third quarter came out higher than our expectations, but for the full-year, there is no change.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Matt, I would say operationally, as you know we've been working to try to level our shipments throughout the course of the year. And we have been increasingly successfully doing that. And a couple of million dollars going either side of a particular shipping date can make a $1 million or $2 million swing. So we're not suggesting a significant variation for the total year.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then as I look at your new business segments, and in particular the margins. I think the one major surprise for me was I think the strength in the Healthcare Products margin and maybe the lower margin in kind of Healthcare Specialty Service. And I think the one piece that is moving from one to another is the IMS piece, and it looks as – I think about a year or two ago you had been suggesting that that was going to be moving more towards company average. And it looks as if that was coming in a little bit below that, was that maybe more of a drag to your Healthcare margins over the last year, year-and-a-half than maybe we had thought?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, Matt. I would say, two points on that, I guess. It's hard for me to know what you thought. But in terms of, I'll call it, over time, what has happened, there are two kind of significant moving parts, there is a lot of little ones, but two significant ones. There is about $50 million business that moved from Synergy's HSS business over to our Health Products business, the products business, that did not materially change the overall effects, so if anything, it would have averaged it down a little bit. And so we just had a very strong and continued strong period, if you will, on the Healthcare Products piece of the business, both the surgical and the IPT business had good solid capital shipments, which of course then covers more overhead, and they also had good margins in the consumable side of the business. So that was a – that's purely any differential you see there is purely better performance on an operating basis, you would have seen it with or without the combination of Synergy Health. On the question of the HS business, which includes obviously the Synergy's historic hospital systems business and the IMS business. IMS has moved quite favorably over the course of the last two years, just as we have described. Again 1 percentage point, 100 basis points here or there quarter-to-quarter the last couple of quarters, going up or going down, that's not out of the question, but generally speaking IMS has moved just as we had expected it to. There are a couple of things that are different than you might have expected, both Synergy when they reported their earnings for their segments did not include as much of the, I'll call it, overhead in the businesses, we include much more of the overhead in our cost of goods sold, we have kind of a four walls view of the world and anything that sits inside the four walls of those facilities gets captured in COGS, whereas other people might put it in corporate expense or some other place in OpEx. So there's a reduction that is – at the bottom-line it makes absolutely no difference, so it's not a concern to us, it didn't surprise us, any of those things, but compared to what – if you are looking at their external reporting and our discussions of our internal reporting, we're not – it would not be surprising for you to be a bit surprised, I guess is a good way to say it. The second piece of that is, clearly Synergy was and we are investing in that business. We are significant – we have significant new startups going on in North America and we are investing in other places in that business, and so since we do anticipate that business being a growing business going forward, we are investing in it and so that also depresses the earnings a bit. As you know from a lot of conversations with me over the course of time, if something is not making double-digits, I'm kind of unhappy and if something is making over 20%, I start getting nervous kind of things, and so in between that range depending on what the capital that takes and all those things. We want to get a good ROIC out of all our businesses. But there are times when you're investing in the business when it makes sense to do that, so at a higher level, that would be the conversation there.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That makes a ton of sense. And if I can just squeeze one follow-up question in on that one regarding the North Shore Supercenter, could you just remind us of the scale and the timing of that contract and the ramp there and are there costs associated with that contract ahead of the actual realization of sales?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Matt, two things. First of all, orders of magnitude, I think, were public with a number of roughly $25 million a year, when you get into full run rate in that facility, that revenue, we have not yet started. So the number right now is zero. And as Adrian mentioned in our last meeting, we're looking to get that started sometime in this calendar year 2016. There have been, New York is fairly well known for tough place to do construction and there are commonly delays, and we have seen those delays, but nothing different than what Adrian talked about six weeks ago. In terms of costs, we are incurring costs as it relates to that as we speak. And so that's one of the investments that we are making.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Speakers, our next question is coming from the line of Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Sir, your line is open.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Thank you. Just to go back to the comments on the gross margin side, if I could for a second. I mean, obviously, you've got a lot of moving parts, we know, you have more OUS mix now, but do we think kind of maybe 39%, 40%is a better estimate of what you're going to look like combined on a go forward basis or how should we think about that?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Yeah, Dave, this is Mike. At this point, I would say it's too early to tell. We are still working on it, we've only had two months of mapping data coming over from Synergy. So we will provide more indication of guidance, once we have our full year plan we'll have a better idea of what that gross margin, if there is a change to that. But obviously, there is fluctuation between gross margin and SG&A, but again focus on EBIT margin. Again, we don't care where we get the benefit from, EBIT margin is really what our bottom line focus is.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Got you there. And then I guess secondly, 1% pricing gain is fairly rare, but I would be curious to know where you're seeing that? And I guess sort of if there is an update sort of on the overall environment out there on the Healthcare side, if that's where it's coming from, any thoughts on that moving forward? Thank you.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We had pricing pretty much across the board, I mean it's not like it was one spot that overwhelmed the others, so. And that order of magnitude any place between 0% on 1% is not a shocking number, that's kind of – if you look over long periods of time on a comparable product basis in Healthcare that tends to be a comparable product basis. And you get most of your pricing in new products and that doesn't show up, quote unquote, in pricing, that shows up in volume. So – on the Healthcare side. On the Life Sciences side, we do tend to see modest pricing – Life Sciences and I just want to say, we do tend to see modest price increases in line with inflation and of course right now inflation is 0.5% or whatever it is. So those kind of numbers are fairly routine.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Cooley with Stephens. Sir, your line is open.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. I appreciate you taking the questions. Can you hear me okay?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Chris.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. Again, congrats on the quarter and I realize there a number of moving parts this quarter with the integration. Let me just maybe start on the cash flow to make sure we're all on the same page and correct there. The reduction in the credit guide, the $25 million there with an additional $85 million, if I'm looking back the numbers correctly here that you spent on expenses and the pension obligation. And then you had I believe the last quarter's call or the update call about $45 million to $50 million in planned expenditures, I think that now look closer to $100 million. So I just want to make sure I understand, what the incremental $50 million was that gets you on an adjusted basis back up to $200 million? I understand that the underlying business hasn't experienced any degradation there in its margin or profitability and the outlook is the same, just as we do these one-time add-backs, I just want to make sure we have the buckets correct.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Yeah, Chris, there's two factors here. One, as we're looking – the $85 million is looking year-over-year decline. So, there is three, basically three large pieces there, one is the Synergy Health acquisition cost plus other acquisition costs. In addition to that we did have increased payout levels of our annual compensation, and then we did have a pension funding. So the total of those are about $85 million, if you look year-over-year. If you just look at our forecast, which is basically a stagnant number, our free cash flow forecast, as I stated earlier, the breakout was incorrect. We still anticipate about $200 million all-in free cash flow, but then the buckets on how we account for those, either from an acquisition or integration standpoint, we blew that split, if you will, last quarter and now we have the split correctly. That $155 million goes from $155 million to $100 million and the difference really is just additional costs, that we knew about, we just did not properly identify those in last call.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. I appreciate that additional color.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: On that, if you go back to the S-4, this is not a differential from what our original thinking was on Synergy. So I don't want anyone to think that it's a change in kind of our general thinking about the Synergy acquisition cost. The S-4 was roughly $75 million, I've forgotten the exact number, $74 million-something. And we ended up, we'll spend about $85 million, $15 million of that $10 million difference or more than all the difference is the FTC litigation cost. So we did spend about $15 million more on litigation costs than we thought. Obviously, we weren't expecting to litigate for a year. And then we had some savings actually on the rest of it. So we ended up being about $10 million over. So if you look at our anticipated integration and – acquisition and integration costs and combined, right now, we're thinking we would be roughly $10 million lower.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Money well spent on the litigation side there. Just one other final one for me, if you look at the Life Sciences segment, a little bit stronger than what we would have expected. Understood the consumables portion, but on the capital side, I was a little surprised by that. Can you just walk us through maybe what you're seeing right now on the Life Sciences front more from maybe a kind of 30,000-foot perspective. Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Chris. And I don't think, we're seeing any significant different view of the Life Science capital business than we've seen before that is, order patterns have been fairly consistent and our backlogs are fairly consistent, it's just when you look at any given quarter or any given month, since it tends – it's a small business that comes in relatively large chunks, it tends to be a little lumpier than the rest of our business. So we did have a – we've got a couple of nice quarters now in Life Science Capital. And we've been anticipating that we had – we were weak, six months or so ago, people were asking us why we were weak in Life Sciences, it's basically just the business is fairly steady. Now we have seen a pickup in our hydrogen peroxide product lines. And so we do see that favorably and that's a good profitable product for us, so that's part of the operating profit, operating margin improvement, both the volume coming through the plants as well as the mix to that kind of product line. But other than that that we should say – the other thing that comes through, obviously in total in Life Sciences is the GEPCO acquisition we did. And that is working just as we expected it to, which we expected a good performance and they're performing nicely. So that is pretty much as anticipated as well. But it's a nice pickup.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: And, Chris, just on a year-to-date basis through the third quarter, Life Sciences capital is up 4%, so as Walt said, we know this is a lumpy business, but 4% for the year is good.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you so much.
Operator: Speakers, our next question is from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Sir your line is open.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Hi, everyone.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Good morning.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Just a question Walt, it's always good to get your thoughts on the hospital spending outlook both in the U.S. and overseas, as well as the UK, areas you might be excited about as well as the areas of concern?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I will start with North America since that's the one that gets the most attention I suppose and we have clearly seen, again, if you go back, we had a couple of years where we basically said it was flat and then maybe a year or so ago we said things looks like they're picking up and last quarter, we said they might be picking up a little better than we thought even or little more favorable, and I think that has continued. So we're seeing nice trends, we're not seeing 20% improvements in, I'll call it, long-term outlook, but clearly our order rates have been quite strong, last quarter quite strong this quarter. We had a good shipment quarter and yet we still increased the backlog. And kind of looking out forward, it still looks pretty similar. In terms of mix, which we're often asked about, I'll call it the replacement business versus the large order business or project business, we have – we kind of saw it moved back to the kind of the normal levels kind of 70-30, 70% being replacement. But we did have some exceptionally, some good strong orders in the month of December that are more project related, so our projects were up a bit. And I don't know the weighted average of, let's say, the last six months, but it have been running pretty much normal and we picked up a little bit in the month of December. So we'll see how that looks. Looking out forward our outlook of our pipeline looks pretty normal for us, but also looks, continues to stay at the levels we've been seeing the last a little bit, so continues to stay strong. We do think we're doing nicely in terms of holding our fair share of the business, but we also see other people in our business, the capital business reporting strong revenues and strong outlook. So we know this is somewhat and this is – we think we're doing a nice job, but we think the market has also picked up. Outside the U.S, we consider EMEA, Europe, we've been weak there, mainly – mainland Europe, if you will or Europe as we normally think of it, is not strong but it's not been terrible for us. EMEA has been very or the Middle East I should say has been very difficult for us, and pretty much everybody I think. And I think we see that continuing for a while. Given both the economic uncertainty with oil and then the uncertainty related to some of the geopolitical issues, we're not seeing a strong market down in that part of the world, which is significant. For us Asia-Pacific has picked up. We're less China-centric than some other folks, so although what China does, does affect that area. Asia-Pacifica has come back a bit, and so we've seen some kind of back to our normal levels, we were soft in Asia-Pacific. And then Latin America conversely has been weak and we see some continued weakness there. And again, those economies that are based on either minerals or oil are pretty tough. And we – so Brazil, Venezuela and a number of the countries in Latin America we're seeing some weakness. At a high level, I think that's pretty much it.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: All right. That was helpful. And just a question on R&D came in at the low 2% as a percent of sales. Is that about the level we should expect going forward or is that something you still have to finalize with your plan?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we want to work on that, but you have to – I would say a couple of things. You may remember last quarter, you were asking us about R&D being above normal amounts, which hurt our operating income. And so as we've said before, sometimes R&D comes in lumps and as you're doing a project or building prototypes whatever, you can see $1 million or $2 million run through pretty quickly. So some of that is just temporal ,but the other thing that we have to consider is we're increasingly a service business and so we have that recurring revenue. So when you apply our R&D spend to our total revenue, it looks much different than our R&D spend to the specific revenue, the R&D is applied towards. So as you might expect the businesses like U.S. endoscopy that have a high concentration of new products and very medical device oriented in that and product development dependent. Their R&D spending is much more like what you would see in the other device sectors, in the high single-digits and sometimes in the low double-digit kind of numbers depending on what we have going on. Whereas on the service side, it is effectively zero. So at least at this time, that's how – we actually do R&D in service, but in service R&D, we don't capture it in that bucket, and that's something actually I do want to think through some, we may be able to – we want to think through how we do that, we may be able to give some guidance on that going forward, we'll see, but to the extent we do not capture it on our books as R&D, it just shows as expense.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And finally, where should we expect CapEx to end fiscal 2016 at and any early thoughts on fiscal 2017?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Yeah. We have forecasted $135 million for the combined company for CapEx for fiscal year 2016, and then we will provide guidance in 2017 when we have our conference call in April or May.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Thanks a lot.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Operator: Speakers, our next question is from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Sir, your line is open.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Terrific. Good morning, everyone.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Larry.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Good morning, Larry.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So you know, I got a lot of questions coming into the quarter from investors relative to FX and it's not surprising that there is increased international exposure for you guys and the volatility of rate. So it might make sense just to again sort of provide some color on where your FX exposure is in terms of currencies and perhaps give us some thoughts on how you're thinking about FX into the balance of the year?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Yes, certainly Larry, this is Mike. One of the issues that we definitely had is what we're comparing to, right. So our year-over-year comparison, as we anniversary the Synergy Health acquisition, our comparisons will get a little bit different and they will shift. And as I said earlier, that will cause our revenue to be more sensitive to fluctuations in currency than we are compared to legacy STERIS, but also cause our bottom line to be less sensitive to fluctuations in currency versus legacy STERIS. So once we get to that point, we will have a shift. That shift has already started, it just we don't have a comparison to measure against.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If you look it on an actual basis, Larry, our exposure is clearly relates to the UK pound because as we translate the pound base, because our second largest both operating base and revenue base is in UK. And so any fluctuations to the pound will have an effect on us. And then the other places where we do businesses outside the U.S. and the UK, of course U.S. since we report in dollars doesn't have an effect. Outside the UK, the euro would be a very strong component because we have a good sized revenue base there. And then everything else tends to be more from a manufacturing side of the equation than cost side. So we have the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso are significant in that. So those four currencies make up the bulk of our differential. But, as Mike said, it depends on what you are comparing to. We have that exposure and actually this has moderated our income exposures. We're doing forecasting going forward, when we do our forecast, say, okay, now what is the impact of a change in currencies going forward. We are more naturally hedged now than we were. And so we used to have fairly significant exposure, if you will. And then we were reverse of what most companies are, we tend to be positive, if the dollar strengthened and negative, if the dollar shrank, but that is going to moderate on the bottom-line, which is the one we care the most about obviously.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: And Larry, just to help you out even further. If you look at our forecast, what we have included in our forecast is based upon forward-looking rates as of December 31, 2015. What we have baked into our forecast is we have in – the full year, the FX currency rates impact on revenue for the full year, year-over-year compared to legacy STERIS will be about $28 million negative to the top line. But about $20 million positive to EBIT. And that's for the full fiscal year 2016 compared to the full fiscal year 2015 for legacy STERIS. Hopefully that helps.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, that helps. And just one quick question on that. So am I understanding this correctly that you in your sixth – in the plan that you basically have at this point. You're using December 31, 2015 rates?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: That is correct, Larry.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And then the second question, just sort of a bigger picture question, I guess, Walt, for you, and I know you've been thinking a lot about this over the last year plus, but now that you've combined Isomedix and the Synergy contract sterilization business, what is the growth strategy for AST and can you weave in there a little bit of where do you want to go as it relates to Gamma, versus E-Beam, versus ETO and maybe just an update on any cobalt pricing and supply?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So I'll step back a little bit, I guess Larry and say, you have to remember what the basis of this business is. And the basis of this business is the medical device industry. Specifically, those who have devices that touch the blood stream, so they have to be sterile. And what we will be doing is locating facilities and growing capacity where we believe the device industry is growing and going. We were historically, if you will unhedged for those businesses that we're moving outside the United States and decided to sterilize where they manufacture – the manufacturers have two choices; they can manufacture at one place, send it to the U.S. at a distribution facility and sterilize near their distribution facilities or they can manufacture OUS and sterilize near the manufacturing point. And the reverse is true for things that are built in the U.S. and shipped to other places. So we will locate in or around these centers of manufacturing and/or centers of distribution around the world. We now have a much better footprint to follow them if you will wherever they go. And so that's number one. Number two, in terms of technologies, as you've pointed out, there are two basic technologies, gas and radiation. And we will be – we're not overwhelmingly one way or the other on gas versus sterilization, it depends on the technologies that manufacturers need based on their design and their packaging requirements. Although, we tend to be a bit heavier on the radiation side than we are on the gas side of the equation. So we're stronger on the radiation side. In terms of cobalt and E-Beam and potentially other forms of radiation, clearly, in terms of that, that we will be watching that and working with the manufacturers to see what their design requirements are and how they want to process, but it's clear that we have now a much larger footprint in the E-Beam side of the business, and that was purposeful. We have grown our footprint in E-Beam, as you know now we have two new factories that are coming up here in the next few months in the U.S. that have significant E-Beam capacity. So we are growing our E-Beam capacity. Synergy also has E-Beam capacity around the world. So we are – STERIS in total now is, again, much more hedged cobalt, E-Beam than we were before whereas STERIS was historically almost completely cobalt. In terms of cobalt supply and pricing, as you know, we have intermediate to long-term contracts depending on how you think the long-term is, not 30-year contracts, but not one-year contracts. For our cobalt supply, we at this point, although we have effectively two potential sources of supply in the world, we are not concerned about our source of supply at this point.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Sir, your line is open.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Yes, hi good morning. First, I was just wondering if you can help us a little in terms of, as you look at cross selling opportunities now that you have combined with Synergy, are you seeing heightened customer interest and do you need to invest more, for example, in your sales force or you're pretty comfortable with where the levels are right now?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I have to kind of – well, I guess I would ask a question. Mitra, are you talking mainly about the AST side or mainly about the Healthcare side?
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Actually both. Both. Thanks.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I should have just answered one and gone with it, right.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: I'm sorry.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just kidding. On the AST side, we were very strong as was Synergy with the multinationals in this space. It does give them more opportunity to think about working with us in a more seamless fashion, so they're happy about that. We pretty much cover North America, and they pretty much cover Europe and Asia. So we don't see a requirement for expansion of sales force based on that; we think we're well-covered. If anything, there might be some modest synergies there, but nothing to – not a big number. You'd never notice, either direction. On the Healthcare side of the business, it's somewhat similar in that Synergy was clearly stronger in the UK market and other places in Europe and they had developed, were developing – had developed and were developing sales force in the United States. We clearly have seen, as I mentioned, we also, as you may recall IMS had a portion of its business that was also into the sterilization outsourcing of CSDs. And so we've been able to put those two groups together, as I mentioned and we have seen a reduction in those costs. We will see an ongoing reduction of costs and we believe we'll be able to do that. We will be adding in that space, but we will be able to do it more efficiently working as one unit than we would have as two. So we do think, there is efficiencies there.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Thanks. And quickly, Walt you said, when you look at the cost savings you expect $5 million by the end of the fiscal 2016 getting up to about $40 million annualized in a couple of years. If you can remind us where most of that savings or where you expect to get most of it from?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I'll go back to the S-4 and there might be some minor variations, but we have a couple of million dollars, as I recall, buried in the AST business, a little bit more $4 million, $5 million in the HSS business, as we now call it our Health Service business, as we now call it, of the cost synergies. The balance was in for lack of better terms corporate and back office. Corporate is a pretty big piece, a CEO, CFO and a couple of senior type executives go a long way on those kind of numbers and then the balance is back office. The back office will take longer than the others. So it has the longer runway, but that's generally where it is. Now, if I were a betting man, if I look at our history, in doing these things, we always have surprises both ways. Where we, I think, if anything were probably conservative would be in the businesses themselves, if I were betting me, I would bet the businesses outperform. And sometimes, the way we split it in the S-4, if we don't know exactly which business it goes into it, we leave it in corporate. So if I were a betting man, we will see more inside the businesses when we report them out over time, either because we didn't know exactly where to put it or because they outperformed the numbers that would be our experience from past times. And then if I were a betting man, the back office ones are always the hardest to get. We'll get them, not hardest, difficult, hardest in time. Because often times, we have to change information systems, we have to do things to lean out the processes before we get the benefits of that. And so, if I were a betting person, on balance we'll get whatever we thought we're going to get there. But if they were going to be faster or slower, I'd bet on slower. In total, I'm very comfortable with what we had on place.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Speakers, I show no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations: Thanks everybody for joining us today and for your continued support in STERIS. And we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Thank you, Julie, and good morning everyone. It is my pleasure again to be with you this morning to review our second quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Walt will provide his commentary on our performance. We are pleased to report another strong quarter. Total company constant currency revenue grew 8% in the second quarter. The components of revenue growth include an 8% increase in volume, plus a 2% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a 2% decline from foreign currency. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter increased 80 basis points to 42.7%. Gross margin was positively impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange rates, lower material costs, and improved productivity. EBIT margin increased 140 basis points to 16.3% of revenue. The increase in EBIT margin is due to the gross margin improvement I just mentioned, somewhat offset by increased spending in research and development. The increase in research and development spending is primarily related to the development of procedural products and accessories. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 31.4% compared to 36.7% in the second quarter of last year. Through the first half, we have had favorable discrete item adjustments, primarily related to the acquisition of Synergy Health, which we have not forecasted to continue in the second half of the year. Our full year adjusted tax rate is still expected to be about 35%. Net income increased 24% to $50.1 million or $0.83 per diluted share. Moving on to our segment results, Healthcare revenue grew 3% in the quarter. Contributing to that growth, Healthcare Service revenue grew 4%, Consumable revenue increased 2% and Capital Equipment revenue increased 3%. Across the entire Healthcare business, we continue to see solid growth in the United States, offset by weakness in the rest of the world. Healthcare backlog at the end of the quarter was $136 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. Healthcare operation margins were 12.6% of revenue in the quarter, a decrease of 30 basis points year-over-year. The positive impacts of increased volumes and favorable foreign currency exchange rates were more than offset by higher R&D spending and higher SG&A expenses incurred in part due to the acquired businesses. Life Sciences revenue grew 20% in the second quarter. Supporting that growth, consumable revenue grew 32%, partly due to the acquisition of GEPCO and partly due to the organic growth in consumable revenue. We also experienced a 25% increase in capital equipment revenue and a 3% increase in service revenue during the quarter. Life Sciences overall second quarter organic revenue grew 11%. Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $47.3 million, an increase of 3% compared to the prior year. Life Sciences second quarter operating margin increased to 29.4% of revenue. This increase is due to higher revenue mix of consumables due to the addition of GEPCO, the increase in volume and the impact from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Isomedix had another good quarter with 8% revenue growth driven by demand from our core medical device customers. Isomedix operating margin was 31.3% of revenue, an increase of 330 basis points as compared to the prior year, due primarily to the increase in volume on a fixed cost base. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $162.2 million of cash and $829.8 million in long-term debt. With the anticipated Synergy Health combination closing on Monday, our total debt will increase to just over $1.6 billion with an average interest rate on that debt of approximately 3%. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio as defined by our financing agreements is expected to be about 2.9 times immediately following the close. The funds needed to close the deal will be provided by our bank credit agreement and will consist of a $400 million term loan, with the remaining coming from our expanded revolving credit facility. While we still will have some dry powder remaining, as we have discussed in the past, one of our goals over the coming quarters will be to pay down debt. Our DSO was at 58 days at quarter end, an improvement of two days as compared with last year. Our free cash flow for the first half was $39.6 million, a decrease of $69.2 million last year. The decline is primarily due to a decrease in operating cash flows. Cash from operations for the first half was $79.5 million, a decline of $104.9 million last year, primarily due to an increase in our previous year's annual compensation program payout, expenses related to the Synergy Health transaction and a pension contribution made in connection with the settlement of our only remaining legacy pension obligation. Capital spending was $16.4 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $23.7 million. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Michael, and good morning to all of you. I have a little bit of a cold, so hopefully you will be able to hear me well. We are pleased with our performance in the first half of fiscal 2016 with organic constant currency growth of 5%. Much like our peers, we are seeing mixed performance globally. In particular, we continue to see challenging market dynamics in portions of Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. These challenges, however, are more than offset by double-digit growth within the U.S. during the first half of fiscal 2016. From our perspective, we continue to believe that the U.S. market remain stable for our products and service offerings. Our profitability continues to show steady improvement, as operating margins in the first half improved 100 basis points, while earnings per share grew 19%. Looking at our segments, we saw favorable organic volume growth across the board. Healthcare revenue growth of 6% reflects strength in many portions of the business, including double-digit growth in service revenue, which includes our routine service as well as IMS. Capital equipment revenue also grew double digits in the U.S. We saw strength in several new products, including our line of AMSCO washers, surgical room lights, and U.S. endoscopy, care and cleaning, and polypectomy products. Offsetting that strength, we saw declines in the EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America as a result of weakness in their economies and currency impact. Life Sciences revenue grew 9% in the first half, with low single-digit growth in both capital equipment and service revenue. Consumable revenue grew 19% and includes the GEPCO acquisition, which closed on July 31. We are excited about the addition of GEPCO and are very pleased with its performance to date. Isomedix had another solid first half with 6% revenue growth, driven by ongoing demand from our core medical device customers. As we have discussed in the past, we are currently expanding in both the Northeast and on the West Coast to accommodate additional demand from our customers. We anticipate that these expansions will come online in the second half of fiscal 2017. As you know, we are working diligently toward closing the Synergy Health acquisition this coming Monday, November 2. I would like to thank both the Synergy team as well as the STERIS team for working extremely hard over the past year to make this acquisition a reality. The strategic merits of the transaction will benefit our customers, our people, and our shareholders. I know all of you are looking for updates on the combined company's forecast to help build your models. We will be working on providing that information as soon as practical. Keep in mind that we've only recently seen their latest forecast. We need some time to review, understand, and quantify the changes from IFRS to U.S. GAAP, evaluate potential intercompany transactions, and understand their views on forecasting risk and uncertainty. With that said, we are committed to updating the market on our outlook before the end of the calendar year. As we have said before, we continue to be confident of the synergies outlined previously in our public filings. Obviously, the timing of those has shifted from our original plans. On a historic standalone basis, we are confirming our prior outlook for top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016. As we said last quarter, we are increasingly confident toward the high end of our $3.15 to $3.30 earnings per share range. We see no reason to adjust our standalone guidance, as we will release new STERIS combined fiscal year 2016 guidance soon. We are trimming our free cash flow outlook a bit to reflect expenses related to the acquisition of Synergy Health. Our revised outlook is for $130 million in free cash flow this fiscal year. Before we open to questions, I want to take a moment to thank all of you for sticking with us over the past year as we worked through the Synergy transaction. We think the combination of our two great companies will be well worth the effort, well worth the uncertainties, and well worth the wait as the new STERIS will be better positioned as a global leader to provide comprehensive solutions to device companies, pharma companies, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities around the world. The combined entity brings the strength of both businesses together to accomplish much more than either one of us could separately. We are excited about finally being able to welcome the 6,000 people of Synergy Health to STERIS next Monday and look forward to accomplishing great things together. With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to open for Q&A. Julie?
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations & Head-Media Relations: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A session. Olivia, would you please give the instructions, and we'll get started?
Operator: The first question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Sir, you may proceed.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Walter, I'm wondering if we could just start with the backlog in Healthcare which, as you mentioned, was up 16%. Could you just walk us through where you're seeing the interest where your orders are coming in? I'm just trying to get a lay of the land out there what customers are focused in on right now.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Larry. Good to see you today. The first thing I would say is it's both Life Science and Healthcare, we've seen more strength and strength in backlog. And then in Healthcare, clearly it is the U.S or North American segment that is driving the increase in the backlog. We have seen pretty much across the board growth. Almost all of our major capital equipment areas have seen significant increases in backlog. And we are seeing a combination of the, I'll call it the project areas as well as the ongoing replacement areas. So, it's been kind of an across the board increase in orders that have resulted in greater backlog.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, terrific, and then two other quick ones for you. First off on just sticking with Healthcare on the operating margin, which as you indicated was down 30 basis points year-over-year. I know that you said that there was some higher R&D and SG&A in there from the acquired businesses that impacted the margins. But, if you were to strip those out, could you give us some sense of again how those margins are trending. And I think you've had plans over time to try to take that higher and perhaps you could talk to is that still the focus. And then separately on IMS and again specifically the attempts to drive the margins up there. If you could give us the status of kind of how those efforts are going, that'd be helpful? Thank you.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll try to catch – I think that was three questions in there. I'll try to catch them all. The R&D side, there is – there are two factors, the first is indeed that the businesses we acquired have significant R&D expense and R&D expenses greater than those on average on a percentage basis than we have particularly the Black Diamond Video, which is consistent with our VTS business – historic VTS business as well. So for lack of better terms, we'll call that a mix effect. Secondly, as you know, R&D does tend to be a little bit lumpy. And so, as projects run through one quarter to the next R&D percentages can vary fairly significantly. And then thirdly, having said that, we are investing pretty much across the board in our businesses for new product and new process opportunities. So we are investing a bit more in R&D across the board. I think the second piece of your question was the OpEx or the – excuse me – the balance of the cost of the rest of the business and what margins would've been, had there not been the increased R&D and we're not getting into that level of detail in terms of the number, but it would have risen and obviously been better than it currently is, but it would have risen without that R&D increase if you will. The third question – maybe I should push a little further, because, as you know, we have a number of projects on the plate to lower our costs, things like in-sourcing and some of our lean processes and we're just pretty much on the plan on those, some of them are a little ahead, some of them a little behind, but when you net it all out, we're pretty much where we expected to be. So that is one of the sources, if you will, of why we would have been doing better absent the R&D increases. Lastly, on IMS. I think we reported maybe a couple of quarters ago that they were effectively on the percentage of operating income for their business that we had anticipated for them and that has not changed materially, again, maybe up a little or down a little, but essentially the significant increase that we had forecast over the course of time with that business, they have significantly improved their footprint and performance. And so essentially on the plan that we laid out for them.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Or I should say they laid out for themselves.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Excellent, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Sir, you may proceed.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Thanks. Just looking at the deals specifically Black Diamond and GEPCO, can you tell us – help us get an understanding of where they show up in the components of your Healthcare and your Life Science revenues based on the three components, where exactly that those numbers were?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Yeah, Dave. So if we start with GEPCO in Life Sciences that is contained 100% in our Consumables business. So, Life Sciences Consumables grew 32% for the quarter. And I'll bifurcate that factor, part of that was adding GEPCO in for the quarter, but part of it was very good organic growth from our base consumables, revenue in Life Sciences. And then Black Diamond, we consider that to be part of our Healthcare Capital Equipment. And that will be 100% in that number that we discussed in the quarter and going forward.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Dave, I have to interject here because I started everybody up on the wrong path with our friends at GEPCO. It looks like GEPCO, G-E-P-C-O, but it's generally kind of pack. And so we have to get it – we have to retrain ourselves. My good friends at – after the call last quarter, my good friends at GEPCO told me I was pronouncing their name wrong. By the way, Rosebrough is not an easy one either, so I'm accustomed to it and we're going to try to move people to GEPCO.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: People get Turkaly wrong a lot as well. In terms of – and, Walt, I'm going to fire one and just see. You may not be able to answer. But just curious given that the closing's Monday, we've talked about some pretty significant tax benefits. Can you guys even discuss sort of how quickly those come on? I mean is it immediate if it closes on Monday in terms of your fiscal third quarter. Would we see that drop immediately or is that something that takes time?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Dave, that we anticipate getting that reduction in tax rate on our full fiscal year. But it is going to bleed in quarter by quarter for that full fiscal year. Well next year and 2017 obviously, yeah.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Mishan from KeyBanc. Sir, you may proceed.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning Walt, Mike, Julie.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations & Head-Media Relations: Good morning.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Congratulations on nearing the goal on here on Synergy Health. I was just hoping if you could comment a little bit on how much interaction you've had with them through the FTC process, and how prepared you are from like day one to asses and integrate?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's a mixed bag in terms of – there were a number of things that are inappropriate to discuss and/or do until we are one business. And so, even now there are things we cannot do it would be inappropriate to do until we are able to merge. Having said that, there are a lot of areas that are not I'll call it customer-focused areas, where we are able to do quite a bit. And so, we have done some work on that. We clearly had put that on hold the last nine months, 10 months, because of the uncertainty of when we would be able to come together or even whether we would be able to come together. So a number of things that would have been I'll call it strategically sensitive and/or customer interface sensitive, we put on hold. But we do have a fully-formed integration team, we do have a fully-formed plan, the integration teams I should say, they're multiple teams there's an overall – overarching team and a multiple team. We have those staffed. The ones that could meet earlier have been meeting earlier, the overarching steering committee has met. So we have, we're not letting grass grow underneath our feet in terms of the integration. It's going to be slower than it would've been by a year, but we don't expect it to be any slower than that.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. And then on to the Healthcare backlog, it's nice to see it up. But I think the past couple of quarters, you've been telling us that don't necessarily focus on it as there has been some changes in the time it would take to get an order to delivery. And is that 16% more of a relevant number than it has been over the last couple of quarters?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would answer a couple of issues. One issue is, we have worked to be able to get I'll call it order entry to delivery process quicker, and it's still – it remains quicker. That is still true and we want to make it even quicker. Having said that, if total volume, total business comes in faster than the plant is tuned to run even if the process is quicker, the plant is only tuned to run so fast. We can change that over time, but you cannot change it immediately. And in fact we don't want to change it immediately, because we want to run our plants as level load as possible. So we're not going to pick up there what we would call tag time or their process speed faster unless we are confident that the overall stream of orders is going to continue at a newer pace. So that's where you see the uptick in backlog is that our orders have actually come in stronger than our current pace. The third comment is we see shifting of project orders versus on-demand orders or replacement orders, if you will. And those shift around a little bit, so that changes. I do think that backlog will become increasingly less relevant to you guys for several reasons. It's not, A), just what we've talked about. It's not such a strong measure, although it is – we always like to see order rates coming in faster than shipment rates because that means we're growing, so that makes us happy. But also capital is becoming a smaller piece of our overall business. If you go back seven, eight years ago, capital was half the business or something like that. And now over 50% of our business will be in the service and consumables area, probably pushing two-thirds, if I remember right, when you put the two together. And so the modest variation – even though it may be a fairly significant variation in terms of percentage of backlog, that by definition is a lower variation in terms of total annual capital. And annual capital is a lower percentage of our total business. So backlog will become less relevant to you. It's still relevant to how we run the business, but less relevant from your financial forecasting, whereas if we were a 100% capital business you would be much more concerned about it.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: That's helpful. And on the Consumables on the Healthcare side, I think you're coming off just extremely strong comps from last year. But last quarter you also mentioned that you had some distributor problems that you thought would resolve itself and you thought you'd see a little bit improvement. But the numbers came in a little bit lower sequentially. Are you still having distributor issues there?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I wouldn't have called them so much distributor issues, it's just a question of whether the distributors understood the demand pattern from the hospitals. So we weren't having that kind of distributor issue like they weren't doing their jobs. It was just it's increasingly hard for hospitals and thus distributors and thus us to forecast the seasonal demand pattern because the seasonal demand pattern is changing with the changing of insurance, deductibles, and all that driving people away from traditional seasonal patterns. So that was the issue, not an operational issue on the part of distributors. But we have seen a pickup of consumables, but we did have tough comps, particularly outside the United States. We had some very strong orders in the Middle East and I believe in Latin America, but I'm confident in the Middle East last year quarter two. And not only are we not seeing those strong orders, it's dipped. And so it's a particularly strong comp and then a weakness put on top of each other. Our North American business is looking still strong. And then you saw – I was really talking about Healthcare. The Life Science business as you see is strong.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. I'll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question is from Ms. Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Ma'am, you may proceed.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. On the Healthcare side, again on the Consumables portion, in the U.S., do you think that – I guess you alluded to some strength there. Is it reflective of broader procedure volume trends, or can you speak to the drivers behind that?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You are correct, Erin. Our U.S. business is driven and most of our business is driven by procedures, both the Isomedix business as well as the hospital business. And we do think procedures have been holding up vis-à-vis total hospital revenue. There's continued pressure to shorten length of stay. There's continued pressure to move patients from higher to lower acuity. But the procedures still need to be done in operating rooms or ambulatory surgery centers or endoscopy suites, and we continue to see procedure growth.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And what are you seeing right now in the competitive environment in the contract sterilization business in light of everything that has happened with Sterigenics and Nordion and how that landscape has changed since that deal was closed?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know, Erin, that we've seen any significant differential really in the last five or six years. Clearly, we have good strong competitors in the business and clearly we will continue to. But both of us – or the industry, I should say, really the industry contracts typically for relatively long periods, and customers need to be very close to the sites that the sterilization occurs because often the cost of transportation is greater than the cost of sterilization. And so those factors continue as they have been. Obviously, we've seen growth in the underlying medical device business on a unit basis, which means by the way, the procedures that are driving those continue to grow. And we just haven't seen a significant variation across that. And really our combination with Synergy, upcoming combination, globalizes our business more nicely. And we think that's attractive and will be attractive to some of the more global medical device manufacturers, more as probably as a function of gaining business from their in-house because they can rely on us to back up and be global and have a single system, as well as from relatively smaller players around the globe who cannot service those global accounts. But in the end, it's a little like politics. Although the parties matter, all business is local.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Mr. Chris Cooley with Stephens. Sir, you may proceed.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. And, Walt, congratulations to you and your team on finally persevering through on the Synergy deal. We look forward to seeing that, just two quick ones from me.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Chris, for persevering through with us.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Happy to do so.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We know that it put a lot of pressure on you guys. The uncertainty is not helpful and those of you who stuck with us, and there are a number on the call, we really appreciate your efforts on our behalf.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Sure. It wasn't your guy's fault. Just two quick ones from me. When I think about the Life Sciences business, I understand the step-up there from GEPCO, I'll say it correctly hopefully here, was strong in the contribution there, but the organic revenue rate of 11% was stronger than what we've been seeing there. Can you just help us think obviously there is a little bit from the capital pull through, but help me think a little bit about what a normalized rate should be in that business if this changes kind of your thoughts for the underlying end markets for the Life Science piece? And then, I just have one quick follow-up. Thanks much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Chris. Although Consumables are more – what's the right word – steady than Capital, there is variation. Again, it's still relatively speaking, a roughly smaller business. So, a couple of shipments can make a difference and customers do stockpile in that arena sometimes because, for example, they want to make sure their plants don't shut down because they don't have the appropriate chemistries available to work them. So, we do see a little bit of variation – cyclical variation. And we're not perceiving that being a significant change on our long-term forecast.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, super. And maybe unfortunately that's the...
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: With the obvious success in GEPCO, which is a clear growth area for us.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Right, and I don't mean this negatively, but it has been a year now effectively since you guys announced the Synergy deal. Would you mind just reminding us as we look forward to fiscal, into calendar 2016, some of the major drivers that you see for the combined entity that you'd highlighted at the time of the merger? Why this makes sense especially in this increasingly consolidating Healthcare environment? Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Gosh, Chris, it's been so long since we started. I've forgotten completely. I hope you're laughing.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: I am. You could just make up whatever you want at this point.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It hasn't changed from the beginning and we don't expect it to change. We clearly have some cost synergies. You may remember we have two numbers out there $30 million to $40 million. We do think the higher side is the more likely side of that. And a lot of that is strictly what I'll call central office costs. One CEO and one CFO, one board of directors, and those kinds of things, there is a lot that we'll be purchasing broadly across the organization. We'll get a significant piece there. And then there are some areas where we will become more efficient either some redundant people although that – we think that's a relatively small number, actually quite a small number, but there will be some of that. And then the Synergy folks have done a very nice job of looking across their multiple plants on the AST business, what they call AST, what we call Isomedix. As they look across their plants and look to get everybody up to the same standard, learning from each other we've done the same. We know we will find out things that they do better than us and vice versa. And so, we expect to see some plant synergy improvements there. That's on the AST side. On the Healthcare side, we really expect that to be more of an upside revenue synergy approach, not an upside cost synergy approach, and that is – the Synergy folks run outsourced CSDs, Central Sterile Departments. One of our biggest customers single entity or type of customers are hospital CSDs. So we provide them capital equipment. We provide them consumables. We certainly would expect to see a movement. And since most of theirs were in Europe and that's not where we have been as strong as we have in North America we would expect to see a pickup in market share in their facilities rapidly. And then using that as a footprint to grow outside the U.S. in the historic STERIS IPT business. Conversely the IMS business has an outsourced CSD management business. What Synergy does is build facilities to run CSDs. We believe that the knowledge in those two organizations can come together and in addition with the business that IMS does for a living, the principal business of IMS which is taking care of the surgical instruments and scopes. We see significant opportunities to gain knowledge and grow both of those businesses using the knowledge of the other. So we think that is an upside – longer term upside revenue generating synergy. We believe that will be significant over the longer term. And then lastly, there is this minor detail of some reduction of our tax rate as a result of redomiciling to England. So I think you put those three or four things together depending on how you count them, there is significant upside opportunities for our business.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Super. Do you have time, can I squeeze one more in just very quickly? Just from a U.S. perspective, I know there is a little bit of angst by some preceding your earnings announcement today about just overall domestic volumes. And I know you – in a prior question you addressed the issue between census days versus actual procedure volume, but it looks like overall end market demand for capital whether it'd be through projects or replacement cycle is pretty strong and maybe building a little bit of momentum. Could you just maybe from a macro perspective talk about the domestic market environment, just kind of the sentiment at your end users or your customer base from a healthcare perspective? Thanks much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. And, Chris, I suspect I have to split it into the two components, the capital component and the consumable or procedural component. In the end, it's all driven by procedures, but the capital is driven more loosely if you will by procedures, it's driven by the health of the systems and their view of the future. As you have said, the capital side has been getting more robust serially for some decent amount of time now. You may recall that probably for two years or three years, we were saying that the capital business was stable and that might be up a percentage point or two or down a percentage point or two, but not diving and not roaring upward. Maybe about a year or so ago we started seeing more improvement than stable, and so more of a modest uptick in capital orders and in pipeline. We clearly now have seen for the last six months, seven months, eight months, even a little notch up from there, so kind of low single-digit growth rates, maybe even as high as mid single-digit growth rates. And so, clearly we've gone from a period that was flat to maybe flat but down to flat. Now we think it's flat to up. And it looks more up to us than flat. So that's the capital environment. Healthcare, I'm talking healthcare capital in North America. Outside of the U.S., it's still a difficult market and probably increasingly difficult, it's just for us and on both the size of our U.S. business versus the other, and the amount of uptick, we are more than offsetting the international weakness. On the consumable side, it's been more steady actually through that period, and we have seen growth. We do feel that we continue to see procedure growth. We're cognizant of a couple of weeks ago, a couple of the investor-owned chains who report nationally, that they reported forecast weakness not so much current weakness, but forecast weakness. We are watching that. In general, I would say from our conversations, which are anecdotal, not broad based, but our anecdotal conversations is that procedures are continuing to hold up and be again relatively strong. Clearly, patient day type issues, maybe not so strong. That's our picture of the world at this point in time.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Mr. Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Sir, you may proceed.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Good morning.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations & Head-Media Relations: Good morning.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: You talked about the capital equipment environment a little bit outside the United States. Would you say that the environment that Synergy Health operates in has become in that respect more challenging than when you originally announced the acquisition a year ago?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd guess I'd answer it twofold. In some sense it's more challenging on a dollar basis because of the currency change, although they are heavily on the pound and increasingly in the U.S. And so it's less of an issue than – on the one hand, the other currencies have fallen more. And secondly, but on the other hand they've grown more and continue to grow more in the U.S. So there's an offsetting balance there. But in terms of pure currency, yes, it's more challenging. On the other, it's not at all clear that challenging environments are good or bad for Synergy. They have very long-term contracts. But when things get challenging and there is capital constraint, that is a typical time to outsource what would otherwise be a large capital expenditure with a more known or more steady ongoing cost. So it's not at all clear to us that challenging environments are necessarily bad for Synergy's overall long-term growth rate. Now in the short term, it may put downward pressure on their very short-term efforts, but it may actually increase their possibilities in the long term would be my view.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And then what would the new diluted share count for the combined company, what would that be when the deal is closed?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: That would be about 86 million shares once we combine.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And finally, the Life Science business had very strong operating margins in the quarter, and they've been running well above 20% for the last several quarters. Now with the addition of GEPCO, what would you say your long-term margin target is in the Life Science business, recognizing the lumpiness there?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know that we have what I would call a long-term target for it. We tend not to like to go backwards. And so, as you say, we've popped above that 20% line for a while. So all things being equal, we would not like to go below it, but we are probably more focused on growing that business and growing the revenue and holding margins than we are in trying to increase those margins significantly.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: But, Jason, the 29.4% that we're at for the second quarter is not sustainable.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Mr. Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Sir, you may proceed.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thanks for taking the follow-up, guys. Just two quick things, I guess perhaps for Mike. The free cash flow for the year, which was reduced from $155 million to $130 million, could you just walk through just the drivers of that reduction, that $25 million reduction? What's the bridge there?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: For the most part Larry, as we do with the EPS, we adjust the EPS out for, I'll call it, all the noise related to the acquisitions, the amortization, the integration expenses. Our free cash flow is still, I'll call it, an unadjusted number. So the big difference is all of the costs and the expenses that we are having and will have associated with the Synergy transaction. That is the big bulk of that difference. Another small piece of that is we did purchase annuities and have gotten out of the pension business. And we had to fully fund. It cost us about $5 million, which was a little bit about where we anticipated, but it is a little bit of a timing issue. We anticipated that later in the year. It happened earlier in the year. But the big bulk is the Synergy expenses.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for that. And then just quickly on your comments around the tax rate, which you indicated I think if I heard you correctly that 25% for the year – for fiscal 2017, it wouldn't go down on day one. So it'd be stepping down to get to that full-year level. So, does that not imply that your ending tax rate at the end of 2017 would actually be below a 25% rate?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: We will provide more guidance surrounding that. Larry, at this point, I would say we know it's going be a stepwise fashion, but we will provide you when we provide full guidance for Synergy more detail around the taxes. I think that's the safest way to do it.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Mr. Mitra Ramgopal from Sidoti. Sir, you may proceed.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple of quick ones. Mike, regarding the cash flow, I believe you said the plan is to aggressively pay down the debt. I was wondering if that precludes potential further share repurchases or annual hikes in the dividend.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: We definitely want to – and we talked about our prioritization and we did have debt repayment, but we actually did, did increase our dividend in our first quarter from $0.23 to $0.25, and actually that we are at a normal course for payment in December at that $0.25. We will continue to look at making investments in our business from a capital expenditure standpoint, and again, control where we actually think the best value is from an internal viewpoint. M&A in the short run will probably be trumped a little bit by debt repayment, as we are going to step up to a 2.9 times debt-to-EBITDA, and we believe that it is more prudent in the short run to focus on debt repayment. And I would say share repurchases, Mitra are most likely not going to happen, that is obviously our lowest priority. And, I think debt payments would come on top of the share repurchases, at least in the next couple of quarters.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Short to intermediate term, I'm sure. And, Mike's got the priorities correct.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then, quickly on the margin improvements, did you get any benefit in terms of synergies from the GEPCO and Black Diamond acquisitions and also if you can say if you're still getting any benefits from the in-house manufacturing?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The short answer to your question is yes across the board. We do expect, on GEPCO it's not so much margin or costs. There may be a little bit, but it's not significant. That's mainly about growing the revenue, particularly growing the revenue OUS, because we have a much broader distribution system, OUS than GEPCO did. They have very good – when I say, distribution, I'm talking sales and distribution. They are quite strong inside the U.S., but did not do that much outside the U.S. and we have a global footprint in Life Science. So we expect to see that grow, so it's more of a revenue synergy which takes longer. And there is – there will be some modest cost synergies, but pretty modest. On the Black Diamond side, we do see both cost synergies as well as revenue synergies, but those will also be slow to occur both – both will be slow in fact in that one, we may see more revenue synergy in the short run than we do cost synergies. But because again we have – we now have two product lines that are handled by largely a sales force that was in place and ready to do things. We're adding their salespeople to our mix, which we think that will help. But in general, that's more of a growth opportunity as well. Then the manufacturing and/or in-sourcing, we're coming to the conclusion of the bulk of that. So and we're far down the stream, but we are continuing to see opportunity, the opportunity we already saw. For example – the Hopkins facility that we announced sometime ago, probably two years ago or so that we were closing, we're virtually out of that facility today. And you don't capture – you capture much of the cost reductions when you get everybody out, but you don't capture it all until you get the building sold and get that out of there, so we do have more to capture there. It's on target – it's on target except for selling the building and selling the building is some, we won't control the timing of that. So we've estimated it but we won't control the timing. And then we do have ongoing projects, some have been announced and others that we are just beginning to work on, that we will see additional in-sourcing and additional lean improvements throughout our business, but nothing that we've put a number on.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: I show no other questions at this time, I'll turn the call back for any closing remarks. .
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations & Head-Media Relations: Great. Thank you, Olivia, and thank you everyone joining us. This concludes our second quarter call, and we'll talk to you again next time.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the STERIS Fiscal 2016 First Quarter Conference Call. All lines will remain in listen-only until the question-and-answer session. At that time instructions will be given should you wish to participate. At the request of STERIS, today's call will be recorded for instant replay. I'd now like to introduce today's host, Julie Winter, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you Keno and good morning everyone. I have just a few words of caution before we open for comments from management this morning. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Our 10-K for fiscal 2015 and our subsequent filings with the SEC identify certain risk factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. During the review we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to the underlying performance of our operations. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered separately from or as an alternative for, and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedule accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. One last reminder before we get started, because of our pending offer for Synergy, STERIS is bound by the U.K. Takeover Code, which places restrictions on what may be said by STERIS in this call. In particular, only information and opinions which are already in the public domain may be discussed. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President: Thank you Julie and good morning everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our first quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Walt will provide his commentary on our performance and discuss our outlook for the full fiscal year. We are pleased to report another strong quarter and a solid start to fiscal year 2016. Total company revenue grew 7% in the first quarter, driven by a 4% increase in volume, a 1% increase in price and 4% from acquisitions, offset by a 2% decline from foreign currency. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 41.9%. Gross margin was positively impacted by foreign currency and improved productivity, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. EBIT margin increased 30 basis points to 13.9% of revenue due to the improvement in gross margin I just mentioned, somewhat offset by an 11% increase in R&D spending. The increase in R&D spending is primarily related to the development of surgical products and accessories. During the first quarter as part of our plans to fund the Synergy Health acquisition, we issued $350 million in senior notes in a private placement. The notes have 10, 12 and 15-year maturities with an average interest rate of 3.56%. As a result of this issuance, we repaid all of the outstanding debt under our current bank credit facility. We are very pleased to continue to be able to access funds at very reasonable long-term rates. The downside of doing this, at least in the short term, is that we will incur higher interest expense in the fiscal year than we originally planned. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.3% compared with 37.8% in the first quarter of last year. Net income for the quarter increased 16% to $37.1 million or $0.62 per diluted share. Moving onto our segment results, Healthcare had a good quarter, growing revenue 9%. Contributing to that growth, healthcare service revenue grew 20% in part to the acquisition of IMS and solid growth in our core service business. Healthcare consumable revenue increased 3% while capital equipment revenue increased 1%. During the quarter we had very strong double-digit growth in capital equipment in the U.S. offset by declines in the rest of the world. Healthcare backlog at the end of the quarter was $119.8 million, a reduction of about 4% year-over-year, and sequentially increased 23%. Healthcare operating margins were 10.1% of revenue in the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year due to increased volume and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Life Sciences revenue declined 3% in the first quarter, with 6% growth in consumables and 3% growth in service, offset by a 20% decline in capital equipment revenue. Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $48.6 million, an increase of 6% compared with the prior year. Even with the decline in revenue, Life Sciences first quarter operating margin increased 350 basis points to 23.9% of revenue due to favorable product mix as capital equipment represented a lower percentage of the segment's revenue. Isomedix had another good quarter with 5% revenue growth, driven by demand from our core medical device customers. Isomedix operating margin was 30.8% of revenue, a decrease of 90 basis points as compared to the prior year. The reduction, as anticipated, in operating margin is mainly caused by cobalt disposal costs. We continue to anticipate approximately $3 million in total disposal costs for the full fiscal year. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $196.2 million of cash, and almost $690 million in long-term debt. Our DSO is at 57 days, an improvement of five days compared with last year. Our free cash flow for the first quarter was $17.7 million, a decline of $5.4 million due mainly to the cash impact of acquisition-related expenses. Capital spending was $23.5 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $22.4 million. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Let me begin with where we stand with the Synergy transaction. The preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for August 17, and the trial schedule is public. We've been busy with all the activities you might expect leading up to the litigation and remain as committed to the deal now as we were when we announced it last October. As is our normal policy, we do not intend to answer questions regarding the pending litigation, other than process questions. Having said that, let's talk about some of the other exciting things we have going on at STERIS. We had a strong start to a new fiscal year, with mid-single digit organic revenue growth and mid-teens earnings growth. Our product lines generally continue to show growth and the strength of our product portfolio positions us well to win business. Meaningful new products like our updated V-PRO Sterilizer family, new Washer Disinfectors, and new OR lights and booms continue to bolster our performance in Healthcare capital equipment. The same is true in our U.S. Endoscopy product lines. As a result, we've performed particularly well in the United States, while the continued strength of the U.S. dollar has generally increased our cost in local currency internationally, putting pressure on product sales outside the U.S. Healthcare consumable sales were a bit lighter than we anticipated in the quarter, which we believe is due to the timing of orders from distributors. Our June and July consumable orders seem to confirm that theory. Our Healthcare service business had another solid quarter with high-single digit organic growth plus the benefit from the acquisition of IMS, both in terms of organic growth and the fact that the purchase was mid-quarter last year. On a separate note, we are extremely pleased to have our consent decree related to SYSTEM 1 terminated during the quarter. The court's decision to terminate reflects the hard work of our people over the past five years to comply with the terms of the agreement. STERIS takes our responsibility for the health and safety of patients and caregivers seriously, and our people work diligently together to take care of our customers and meet the FDA's requirements. We have learned a great deal from our experience working with the agency and have a better awareness and understanding of their positions. We have been fortunate that many people at the FDA have helped us to learn and improve. Although this experience has taken significant resources, I believe we have benefited a great deal working so closely with the agency these past five years and are a better company for having done so. We fully intend to continue working with and learning from the FDA in a constructive manner. Our Life Sciences business continue to deliver growth in recurring revenue in the quarter. Life Science had a down quarter in capital equipment revenue, reflecting the characteristically lumpy nature of capital shipments. But capital orders were strong, which is reflected in our backlog. We believe the capital equipment performance was a function of timing as we had several large orders slip into the second quarter. As they have in the past, Life Sciences did a particularly nice job of improving margins, even with the decline in revenue. Isomedix performed as anticipated during the quarter with solid revenue growth. Profitability was hindered somewhat by the Cobalt disposal costs we discussed last quarter, and in Mike's commentary earlier, which was planned. On the M&A front, in mid-June we acquired Black Diamond Video, which complements STERIS' OR integration offering. Black Diamond focuses on the more sophisticated OR integration products that are typically found in large, tertiary, academic and research centers, with high-end technology needs. VTS STERIS' existing products in this space tends to be used more in community hospitals. We believe our greater marketing and sales reach, along with the additional technology platform from Black Diamond will allow us to grow our OR business faster on the same or lower cost base. We're in the beginning stages of integrating Black Diamond with our existing OR integration business to deliver increased value, innovation and support to our customers. Black Diamond will roll up into our Healthcare segment. We also completed the recently announced acquisition of General Econopak or GEPCO, which closed last Friday. GEPCO manufactures consumable product solutions in the areas of sterility maintenance, barrier protection, and sterile clean room products for pharmaceutical, biotech, and veterinary customers. GEPCO will be integrated into our Life Science segment and will further bolster the consumable product range and growth in our global Life Science business. GEPCO products fit perfectly with our existing pharma customer base in Life Science. Their high value-added custom products for clean rooms are the device equivalent of the customized cleaning chemistry solutions STERIS offers to the same call point. Our broader reach, particularly outside the U.S., should allow us to grow this business without adding significant sales and marketing resources. We continue to pursue M&A activity and look for tuck-in acquisitions that are complementary to our businesses around the globe. Now, moving onto our outlook for the year, reflecting the acquisitions of GEPCO and Black Diamond, our outlook for revenue growth is now 6% to 7% which is an increase of 1 percentage point from our original guidance. We have a couple of moving pieces impacting our EPS outlook. Let me spend a few moments on these. First, as previously announced, we do anticipate approximately $0.06 per share earnings accretion this fiscal year from Black Diamond and GEPCO. Second, we were successful in locking in very favorable long-term rates in our May private placement which will increase interest expense this fiscal year, and largely offsets the accretion from those acquisitions this year. When we originally planned the private placement, we anticipated that it would be a part of the funding for the Synergy deal and therefore included the cost of the financing in our models for the combined business, but not for the standalone or without Synergy outlook. Since we've now factored these increased financing costs into our – without Synergy outlook, upon the completion of the Synergy combination, the additional financing costs of the private placement will have already been included. And of course, given the M&A activity we have completed so far this year, we have not made any share repurchases to date. We hope this discussion may be helpful as you factor in these puts and takes in your financial models. With all that being said, we are pleased with our $0.62 EPS at start of the year and are increasingly comfortable with our range of $3.15 to $3.30 for the full year, which excludes the impact of a Synergy acquisition. Thanks again for your time. That concludes my remarks. And I will turn the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you Walt and Mike for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A session. So Keno, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started.
Operator: Thank you Ms. Winter. Our first question is from Mr. Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please, go ahead.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning Matt.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I guess I'm going to start with Healthcare operating margins. Could you give us an update on where you are at as far as your in-sourcing and the closure of SYSTEM 1 manufacturing? I believe you had quantified the SYSTEM 1 is like a $10 million impact annualized and I think you had $8 million to $10 million of cost savings you were expecting to get from the in-sourcing and Lean manufacturing? I was just curious where you guys are at with that now?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah Matt. You've described that correctly. Both of those – just as the math happens to work out, both of those were over two-year periods. And roughly half in each of the two-year periods. So you're exactly correct. And so half for both of those which are roughly $10 million would be about $10 million – $10 million each would be about $10 million this year. And we think we're right on our plan there. Clearly the SYSTEM 1 plant closure or the Hopkins plant closure is a later in the year project. So one is more ratable over the course of the year and the other is much more heavily rear-end weighted. But we're dead on our plans.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then you mentioned an increase in R&D spending. Could you elaborate on where you're spending and maybe the rationale for doing it now?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, first of all, R&D spending is often lumpy. And the nature of it as, particularly as you kind of get toward the end of a project, there is a number of expenses that kind of come rushing in. And for example – project expense where you're building prototypes and things like that get pretty expensive. So some of it is, I would call it, just purely timing. But what we have invested significantly in R&D in our operating room business, pretty much across-the-board. We have new tables, new lights. We're doing a lot of work in the integration space. Now it'll even go up with, in both VTS and in Black Diamond. And we believe those investments are good long-term investments for the business. And so it just kind of happens that the quarter was a little higher than we even expected. But we don't see the year being higher than we expected. It's just the timing of the expense.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then lastly, on the Life Sciences capital equipment. Obviously it was a tough number in the quarter and I think you mentioned timing, but in reality it's been down for a significant period of time and you're seeing in that end market, biotech, pharma, a lot of strength. And you're seeing some stability on the research in government, academic side. What's the disconnect between your numbers over the last three or four quarters and maybe with some of the other life science tools providers?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. First of all Matt, we've clearly seen pharma consolidation in plants. And it depends on what part of the space that you're in. Now, I'm going to break pharma from research to discuss it first. But on the pharma side, we've seen consolidation and continued consolidation in pharma for quite some time. And we did see kind of a bottoming out of that reduction, I don't know, a year-and-a-half, two years ago, when we talked about it at that point in time. We haven't seen continued significant reductions, there is lumpiness. We're expecting a very strong quarter next quarter so I think you'll see kind of the opposite of this view. And for the year, we're expecting kind of a flat line performance for the year – up a touch, but generally flat. So that's point one. In terms of others, it's very hard to get a handle on that because many – in our types of equipment, many of the competitors are local manufacturers. And you may recall that it was not so many years ago where we were losing a lot of money in that space and we decided to quit chasing after jobs that were not profitable. And so we purposefully took a reduction in share at that point in time to go after places that were interested in doing high quality and paying for the work that they were expecting. And we've been quite successful with that. I don't think that we've, since that point in time, when we made that decision, I don't believe that there's been a significant share loss. We do have some new products in the vaporized hydrogen peroxide space, and so we've probably had a little lag here the last little bit on that and we expect to see more of VHP product going out in the future. So that's the pharma side. On the research side, that business has really collapsed, if you will. And it is quite small at this point in time. And we're just not seeing a return to the Life Science side. You are right though, we do like the spaces we're generally in, in Life Science. And you see our consumable business just keeps growing significantly there. And in the long run, once we get through kind of these consolidations of companies, and as a result, factories, in the long run, that means they are going to invest in factories. So that's a good thing. But we continue to see the growth coming on in the consumable side.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. Thank you Walt. That was very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Chris Cooley with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning everyone. And thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones from me here this morning, maybe Walt or Mike. If you look at Isomedix in the quarter, solid mid-single digit growth, but historically we've seen that in kind of the upper single digits. And I realize you've brought on new capacity. We've seen fairly positive commentary from a number of the Healthcare service providers out there, just in regards to procedure volumes during the quarter. Help us think a little bit about lead lag with your end customers relative to what we see on the service side, and kind of maybe reframe our expectations for unit volume growth in that business? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure Chris. We do see a lead lag and unfortunately it's not uniform. Between what sales are, not so much on the service side of that business, but on the device volume side. So if you watch device volume globally – high-end device volume or devices that have to be sterilized volume globally, we will tend to track that. We lead in lag based on their expectations and how they build inventory and don't build inventory, and how their hospitals build inventory and don't build inventory of these products. And sometimes they get it right and sometimes they get it wrong. Over long stretches, six months, a year, we will tend to track that very closely; over short stretches, it varies. And then the other thing that causes it to be, again, somewhat not as uniform as what you might expect, is our pricing tends to be fairly stable in that business, so we go up kind of with inflation kind of numbers. And so our prices are a little more stable, whereas sometimes they get very strong price increases because they bring in new products, which is typically the way devices get strong price increases. And then sometimes if they have less new products, or they're having GPO pressure or whatever, they may not get the prices. So where volume – if you're talking strict volume, unit volume, as opposed to revenue volume, which has some price effect. And often, new products pricing is buried in revenue volume, because it's a new product so it doesn't have a historic price. If you can kind of work through that, then our volumes or our volume growths tend to be very similar to the global medical device growth. So that's kind of a long answer to a short question but that's how we typically see it.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: So just to be clear, I mean, if – just kind of looking at some of the trends that we've seen overall, can we expect that to migrate back towards kind of the mid to upper single-digits over time in terms of just volume growth?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We think, as we've said before, kind of in general across our business kind of mid-single digits is what we're expecting to see in that business in general. And naturally, we hope to pick up a little bit in price and a little bit in share. And so something in that mid to maybe on the high side of the mid. But I don't think we're expecting anything like double-digit growth in that area.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: No. No. Understood. And then, maybe just two quick housekeeping questions. In the quarter, could you maybe break out for us, Mike, what the contribution was from acquisitions? I believe, of the two, you had closed one on the 24th, so I guess technically would have still fallen in the quarter. Was there a revenue or just was there any contribution there in the quarter? And then, could you also maybe just elaborate, again I apologize, I was shuffling a couple of calls here this morning. But what you saw in sales and marketing expenditures during the quarter, maybe how we think about that, that particular line item over the course of the fiscal year? Thanks so much.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President: Yeah. Certainly Chris. So on the acquisitions, acquisitions added 4% to our revenue growth. The bulk of that was, in part the IMS, what do we have at six or eight weeks or something of that nature. We only had Black Diamond for a short period of time and that added roughly $1 million in total so not much impact there. The bulk was definitely from IMS. On marketing expenses, I don't really see anything unique or different in what we – our expectations are. So I don't know, Walt, do you have any comment?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I would say that there's nothing material in sales and marketing expenses, other than those that track with new products and will be captured in kind of R&D – the R&D side, the front end of marketing. But from the back-end of marketing and sales expenses, we don't see any significant changes.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Please go ahead.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First, Walter, I was wondering if you can give us an update in terms of how the surgical repair business is doing. And is there an opportunity for that outside of the U.S. for you?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are extremely pleased with the business we now call IMS, which is both surgical and scope repair. And as you guys know, we've merged several companies together, five companies over the last three or four years, to build that business. And it's built quite nicely and doing quite nicely there on our profitability improvement targets. Probably the biggest risk we had in our planning or thinking about that business, it was not whether the revenue is there. We believe the revenue is strong and will continue to be strong. The opportunity we believe is strong. But the biggest risk was whether we were able to consolidate the businesses and keep growing the revenue and get the cost reductions we expected. And we absolutely have seen that a little more rapidly actually than we expected. So we're very pleased with the business. The – and we're getting very good comments from customers, particularly customers that – our larger customers that spread across geographies, because this has historically been a local geography business, and now they're seeing consistency across broader geographies. So we think that's been a plus for our customers. In terms of international expansion, there is some opportunity there. It would be a nascent business outside the U.S. So it will be a longer-term investment, longer-term opportunity. But we do think there is opportunity there.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Thanks. Also on acquisitions and international opportunities, I mean, the one thing we keep hearing more about, especially in places like in Asia and the Middle East, more specialized hospitals, more medical tourism, et cetera and more surgeries, et cetera being done in these places. I was wondering if that's something you're going to be looking to see if that's also an opportunity for you?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Clearly, we hope and expect to grow our business outside the U.S. faster than the U.S. And we've talked about this before, it's – we've actually grown our OUS business organically faster than our U.S. business. It's just as luck would have it, the things that we've found to purchase and been able to purchase have been more U.S.-centric. So actually our acquisitions have brought us back to our historic level, every time we kind of move – we've been about 75%/25% now for a very long time. We've moved the needle organically, but then we buy more U.S.-centric, if you will, acquisitions. And that's something that clearly we started to do some different things. We bought Eschmann in the U.K. We bought the company in Brazil. We bought in a number of places, smaller businesses around, and we will continue to look at that. And obviously, the Synergy acquisition, one of the principal purposes of that is to grow our OUS business both by acquisition and post that through non-acquisition. So that's been an area that we are quite hopeful of with that acquisition. So we do expect to see the markets outside of the industrialized world growing more rapidly than inside. Right now that's taken a pause. The – Latin America is having significant difficulties. Much of Europe and the Eastern Europe, which is probably a little higher growing, is having some significant difficulties. The Middle East is very tough right now. So although that was one of the kind of the real growth spots, it's pretty tough in the Middle East right now due to both some political turmoil as well as the reduction of the price of oil, which is a significant component in their economy. But we think those are short to intermediate term positives, and we will go back to more rapid growth in those areas, and we anticipate participating.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Thanks again. That's very helpful. Mike I just had two quick housekeeping questions. I was wondering how we should think of the tax rate for the rest of the year? And also, I don't know if you have in terms of the share buyback, what the average repurchase price was?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President: Yeah. Mitra, on the tax rate, we are still anticipating an effective tax rate of 35% for the fiscal year. We were slightly favorable to that this quarter, but still 35% for the full fiscal year is our anticipation. And then on buybacks, I think as Walt said earlier, with the acquisitions we completed in the quarter, we did not complete any buybacks in Q1.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Good morning everyone. So Walt, I wanted to ask you, and hopefully this is within the rules that you set forth for speaking about Synergy, but to the extent that that deal does not get consummated, and your very ample access to capital, which I think has been demonstrated in going after that target, is there a scenario under which we could see an acceleration in M&A activity? I mean, I recognize you did a couple of smaller deals this year, but could we see a pickup in M&A activity? And again, if that deal were not to be consummated, could you give us any thoughts as to perhaps how we should think about size of potential M&A targets?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure Larry. I mean, I would I guess make a couple of points. First is we fully anticipate consummating the deal. We hope to do that and expect to do that. And we're doing our planning that way. But to your point, if for whatever reason that were not to occur. I'd even go further, and if we do that deal, by definition, there'll be some pause of taking a breath and integrating that deal because that's a very significant deal for us. So there'll be some pause, but both Synergy and we were on a track to do accretive acquisitions that fit into our strategic bailiwick, and we would not – doing that deal, we would not want to stop the kind of acquisitiveness they were interested in and not stop the acquisitiveness we're interested in, which are largely tuck-in kind of deals that fit with the businesses we already have, fit with our strategy. So A, we would continue. We obviously wouldn't be doing a deal of that size soon because we would have both cash and integration efforts to sort out for the next little bit. To the extent that's not true, we would feel free to do significantly sized deals, not unlike the Synergy acquisition, which is large. But all things being equal, we typically prefer things that fit with what we already have and tuck in nicely. If you kind of look at the spectrum of things we've done, U.S. and (33:24) was pushing a couple of hundred million. GEPCO was pushing a couple of hundred million. When you take the IMS quintet, you're in the several hundred millions again. So those kind of deals are nice fits for a company that's a couple of billion dollar revenue company, $4 billion market cap, so we like those sizes. But if we see an opportunity, a rare opportunity to do something significant like we saw here with Synergy, we would naturally be attracted to it.
Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's really helpful. And then, I had two other ones. The other question is, you guys have historically concentrated your sterilization efforts, your contract sterilization efforts, on ethylene oxide and gamma radiation. I believe you have two e-beam lines, if you will, that are anticipated to come up in the near term. And so I guess the question that I had for you is, you clearly see some utility in e-beam, and obviously gamma and EtO speak for itself, but have you guys ever even dabbled in trying to develop any X-ray technology at any point, call it, over the last five-plus years?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Larry, we as you know, we do almost every kind of sterilization modality in almost every kind of institution in the world. And we have looked at, if dabbled is looked at, thought about, studied, any of the kind of words you want to use for that. I don't know of a modality that we haven't dabbled in, thought about, looked at, considered relative to those that we are or are not doing. And that's the full gamut, whether that's ozone or X-ray, or pick your poison, any of the modalities. And literally, our R&D people are constantly searching for better ways to sterilize and disinfect things in every possible space. So the answer to your question, broadly speaking, is yes. The answer to your question specifically is yes.
Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've looked at and considered all those things, and we do the ones we think makes sense. And we don't do, or at least makes sense to us or for us, and we don't do the other ones.
Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then lastly for you, you obviously both in your prepared comments and then answering some questions talked about the international markets and some of the challenges that those are facing currently. I guess just to parse it out a little bit, is it fully a function of the dollar is stronger and perhaps there is a combination of some lost business to local competitors as well as perhaps some delayed orders, if you will? And is there anything that you guys can do to, outside of just outright lowering price, is there anything that you can do to help drive some of that international business while we're in this period of a stronger dollar?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Sure. And you're correct. It's not strictly the stronger dollar, which but of course a stronger dollar is not helpful if you're producing in the U.S. But it's not strictly that. The Middle East is largely not a question of a stronger dollar, it's a question of bad oil prices and political unrest. And that's true in Latin America, for example. We used to be very strong in Venezuela. And Venezuela has both political unrest and of course is an oil-driven economy. So they just do not have the hard dollar. So that's not loss of share to anybody, that's just they slowed down. And they need to slow down because they've got to develop the currency to put themselves on track. So there are – and so there are places in the world where it's more, I'll call it, political and/or their particular economy driving it more than anything else. And most healthcare economies are driven by governments, and so that's the case. Now having said that, there are other places in the world where the economies are doing fine or okay where the dollar does make it more difficult for us. But we still – we continue to compete and, as you know, we're working to lower our cost. We don't – we have not raised our prices significantly in the U.S. for some time. We've been able to do that by lowering our cost and we talked about that. Not every dollar we save that we put into our pockets, some of those dollars we put in our customers' pockets to continue to try to grow our business and we think that's a good thing to do for our customers and for us. So we do that internationally. I will say we tend to broad-brush things and I've broken it down a little bit more but we tend to broad-brush things. We say EMEA we're down. Well, in Europe, Europe's fine for us. It is Middle East, that is way down. And so they are more than offsetting the nice work that's being done on the continent, if you will. Again, in Asia, there are countries we're doing well. There are countries that are kind of tough right now. In Latin America absolutely, Latin America we're more down across the board but still Venezuela if you take the last couple of years Venezuela is the biggest reason for international or Latin American business not being as strong as it has historically been.
Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Excellent. Thanks for thoughts Walt.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Chris Cooley with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you very much for the follow-up. Walt, I just was hoping you could remind us procedurally about the upcoming court hearing. I think you're on the docket for the 17th along with several other cases. I think three explicitly for that date. Could you just remind us again in broad strokes about the expected timelines there and when you would hopefully expect to have a ruling from the court? I think that you'd previously stated in mid-September, but I just wanted to walk through the components there. Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Chris. Again, the docket is public. You've hit all the high points very well. It is a hearing in Federal Court and a Federal Judge has wide discretion of what – in this case, it's a he, what he chooses to do with the case and how he hears it. We are scheduled for the 17th. I think there is no indication of anything other than that. So unless something happens in his docket that forces him to move out that, I believe he and we are planning on moving ahead on the 17th. I don't remember exactly. It's a three or four-day hearing time that he has set out for us and I think everyone is anticipating it would be done in that timeframe a few days. And then in terms of ruling, again, this is a Federal judge and he has his time schedule and there is no real time schedule for when he will or will not rule. But generally speaking, our understanding is that inside of a month or so is kind of a normal timeframe. So that's an expectation, but it's not a firm deadline. Again, it is up to the judge's discretion. And largely depending on his docket and what else he has that could cause him to go faster or slower.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. I show no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations: Great. Thanks everybody for joining us. This wraps up our first quarter conference call, and we'll talk to you all soon.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

One last reminder before we get started, because of our pending offer for Synergy, STERIS is bound by the UK Takeover Code, which places restrictions on what may be said by STERIS in this call. In particular, only information and opinions which are already in the public domain may be discussed. With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our fourth quarter financial results. Following my remarks Walt will provide his commentary on our performance for the full fiscal year and discuss our outlook for fiscal year 2016. As usual, our comments this morning will focus on adjusted results. Please see the reconciliation table included with our press release for additional details. We are pleased to report another strong quarter despite the challenging comparisons with a very strong fourth quarter last year. Total revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. On a constant currency basis revenue growth was 10% with acquisitions contributing 9% and price and organic volume contributing an additional 1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter increased 100 basis points to 42.5%. Gross margin was positively impacted by product costs and foreign currency. EBIT margin was 17.8% of revenue, a decline versus the prior year but a substantial improvement sequentially as anticipated. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.9% compared with 33.8% last year. We did have several favorable discrete item adjustments in the fourth quarter, which lowered our effective tax rate below what we anticipated. We do not expect several of these discrete item adjustments to continue at this level of favorability in fiscal year 2016. Driven by growth and operating income and the lower effective tax rate, net income for the quarter increased 9% to $59.3 million or $0.98 per diluted share. Moving on to our segment results, Healthcare had a good quarter growing revenue 9%. Contributing to that growth, Healthcare service revenue grew 43% largely as a result of the acquisition of IMS. Healthcare consumable revenue increased 4% while capital equipment revenue declined 7%. As we said last quarter, we were anticipating the decline in capital equipment revenue in the quarter with strength in our surgical business and tougher comparisons in our infection prevention business. Our results for the quarter were in line with those expectations. Healthcare backlog at the end of the quarter was $97.7 million, a reduction of about 12% year-over-year. As we have discussed all year, we have successfully reduced our manufacturing lead times and we now fill orders on a timelier basis. For example, in products like lights and washers where we have in-source manufacturing, we have experienced double-digit declines in lead times over the past year. In addition to reductions in lead times, replacement orders represent a larger percentage of our total order pattern and pipeline and those tend to be filled quicker and reside in backlog for less time. Healthcare operating margins were 16.2% of revenue in the quarter, a decline of 150 basis points year-over-year due to an anticipated mix shift to lower margin instrument repair and increased research and development spending. While the decline was anticipated, I will say that we are pleased with the progress we are making to improve profitability in our acquired businesses. Life Sciences revenue grew 2% in the fourth quarter driven by continued strength in our consumable franchise with revenue growth of 5% and service revenue growth of 4%, offset by a 2% decline in capital equipment revenue. We continue to see weak demand trends in the research market, offset by pockets of activity in the pharma sector for capital equipment within Life Sciences. Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $45.5 million, in line with our historic levels and up slightly compared with the prior year. Life Sciences fourth quarter operating margin increased 330 basis points to 22.2% of revenue, which was driven by favorable product mix and disciplined operating and expense management. Isomedix had another good quarter with 5% revenue growth driven by demand from our core medical device customers. Isomedix operating margin was 28.4% of revenue, a slight decrease as compared to the prior year caused mainly by higher quality and regulatory expenses. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $167.7 million of cash and $623.3 million in long-term debt. Our DSO was at 64 days, a substantial improvement as compared to 71 days at the end of last year. Our free cash flow for fiscal 2015 was $161.6 million, an increase of $33.6 million compared with the prior year driven by increased net income and working capital improvements. Capital spending for the quarter was $28.5 million while depreciation and amortization was $22.1 million. On a separate note, during the quarter we successfully completed a five-year unsecured bank credit facility. Upon close of the Synergy Health acquisition, we will have immediate access to $1.25 billion of credit. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike. And I'd like to also welcome all of you to our fourth quarter and full year call. We are very pleased to have a strong finish to our year and solid growth prospects heading into the new fiscal year. Now I know you are all focused on the Synergy Health deal and let me assure you that we are too. But until the deal closes, hopefully in the June-July timeframe, we will report to you as the business stands today. We have set fiscal year 2016 targets for STERIS results on a standalone basis. I certainly do not want anyone to infer from that that we are not working to close the deal. And, of course, we will provide combined outlook for new STERIS after we come together. Having said that, let me cover a few highlights from a great year before reviewing our outlook. With revenue growth of 14%, we were able to drive 21% bottom-line growth, primarily due to increased revenue, margin expansion from operational improvements, FX cost favorability and a lower tax rate, all of which more than offset the impact of FX reduction on our international revenues. From an operational perspective, as we discussed at the start of the year, one of our most significant opportunities for improvement was IMS margins, which are lower than our corporate average. As we've suggested on prior calls, we exceeded our expectations for profitability improvement in that part of the business this year and are very pleased with the progress we have made integrating those companies. We've reached our planned operating income percentage targets by the end of FY 2015. The majority of our progress operationally integrating the five companies that form the new IMS is nearly done. As you all know, our costs benefit from a strong dollar. So foreign exchange was positive to earnings on the revenue we generated by about $10 million. However, our international revenue faced headwinds due to the strong dollar and we anticipate that they will continue to do so on a year-over-year basis in fiscal 2016. And lastly, as you've already heard from Mike about the lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate in adjusted EPS, much of which we do not anticipate occurring again in fiscal 2016. Turning to segment performance, Healthcare revenue growth of 18% for the year reflects solid growth in our consumables, in our legacy service business, and of course the addition of IMS and Eschmann acquisitions. Capital equipment ended flat with the prior year. As we discussed last quarter, we have had stronger performance in our infection prevention capital equipment this year, and weaker growth in our surgical capital equipment, which we believe was largely the result of customers waiting for the release of our newer products. In particular, we saw our new generation of lights and booms begin to ship in the fourth quarter, after a bit of delay versus our expectations. We continue to see signs that things are improving modestly in terms of hospital capital spending, and remain optimistic about our ability to grow capital equipment revenue in Healthcare in fiscal 2016, even in the face of the FX headwinds in our international markets. We have new products throughout our portfolio to facilitate growth in Healthcare, including a new, smaller footprint V-PRO hydrogen peroxide sterilizer and accessories, new OR lights, new OR booms and the strongest release of new products in U.S. endoscopy history. Life Science revenue finished the year up 2% with growth in consumables and service, somewhat offset by a decline in capital equipment. Despite the modest revenue growth, Life Science once again generated meaningful profitability improvement both in dollars and as a percent of revenue as a result of strong mix and good expense control. We expect our Life Science business to continue to grow consumables as it has in the past, and continue to add meaningfully to our bottom line. We have new products in both capital equipment and consumables in Life Science and expect to continue to expand our service offerings. We expect revenue growth in capital, consumables and service in FY 2016. And we also look forward to continued margin expansion due to the mix and OpEx expense control, even as we invest in R&D and plant expansion in line with new products we are introducing. Isomedix revenue grew 6% for the year, driven by continued demand from our core medical device customers. As we've discussed for some time, our facilities are running at high levels of capacity and we will continue to invest in expansions where customer demand is available. Margins in Isomedix declined slightly for the year, as we have increased our spending on quality and regulatory over the past year. While we continue to believe that the current margin levels are reasonable for Isomedix over the longer term, we do have two headwinds in fiscal 2016 that will impact profitability. First, we anticipate another $1 million in spending on quality and regulatory as we see the full year impact of investments that have increased over the course of the last year. In addition, we expect to incur costs for the disposal of depleted cobalt-60. As you all know, we routinely load and dispose of depleted cobalt in our gamma plants. In the past, the removal of the depleted cobalt was at no cost as long as we replenished the cobalt with new source. Going forward, we expect to be charged for the disposal of depleted cobalt. We will begin to set up a liability which will impact FY 2016 negatively by approximately $3 million. Beyond FY 2016, we anticipate a recurring $1 million increased expense for the costs of the cobalt disposal or a net reduction of $2 million versus FY 2016. As we look ahead at the new fiscal year, we are excited about the opportunities we see. We anticipate that total revenues will grow 5% to 6% for the year, substantially all of which is organic. We also anticipate growing adjusted earnings within a range of $3.15 to $3.30. For your modeling purposes, we expect the first half, second half split of earnings to be in line with our last five year average experience of 43% first half, 57% second half. While we are no longer providing detailed guidance at the segment level, we anticipate revenue growth in all three segments for the year and are clearly looking for expansion of EBIT margins year-over-year for the whole company. As you saw in the release, our outlook for free cash flow reflects a modest decline year-over-year, which is simply a matter of the timing of capital expenditures. We spent somewhat less CapEx in FY 2015 than we had anticipated and therefore planning on an increase in our fiscal year 2016 capital expenditures. Most of the $20 million increase is for Isomedix expansions. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation priorities, maintaining and growing our dividend responsibly relative to our growth, investing for growth in our organic businesses, targeting acquisitions in adjacent product and market areas, reducing our total company leverage and finally share repurchases if the other uses of cash are lower than our desires and do not offset dilution. Our guidance for FY 2016 assumes no EPS dilution as well as no acquisitions. As we have said, we would anticipate providing an outlook scenario inclusive of the Synergy Health deal after the close of the transaction. It is a perfect segue to my last subject, Synergy Health. Under the UK Takeover Code, combined with U.S. SEC requirements, we are very limited in our ability to comment on the deal or to change or update prior statements and/or forecasts that we have given. As we said in our release last week, we are firmly committed to the completion of this transaction and have been working diligently toward that end. It is our clear goal to close this deal and move forward with the many exciting opportunities we have as a combined company. The strategic rationale for the deal is unchanged. The synergies we have outlined in our public filings still stand today. Although with our current expectations of timing, they will not align as neatly with our fiscal years as we had originally anticipated. As we wrap up another record year, we have much to be excited about, STERIS people have continued to focus on our customers to deliver results and we are anticipating another year of solid growth ahead. With the closing of the Synergy Health acquisition, we hope to catalyze growth in EPS as we share experiences and utilize each other's knowledge and skills. The end result will be an expansion of our global footprint and a business even better positioned as a global leader in infection prevention. We appreciate your time this morning and your continued support of STERIS. I will turn the call back over to Julie for Q&A.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations & Head-Media Relations: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A session. So, Yomi, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started.
Operator: Our first question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. You may begin.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Larry.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Morning. I'm wondering, Walt, if you could come back to some of the comments regarding backlog? And I know that you've been very consistent in your articulating the ability to reduce those lead times. So could you help us think about, as we move forward now, are you at a point where you believe that you've done what you can to get those lead times down and this sort of is a base for backlog or how should we be thinking about that broadly?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Larry, there are two factors that affect backlog. One is, indeed, lead times, and so that is real clear and we've talked about that, we've been talking about that for a while. And the second, is what type of orders the customers are putting in. And so I'm going to separate my conversation into those two. The first, to answer your direct question is in certain of our products, we are probably closing in on what you would expect, but we have other products where we think we can make additional improvements. So I would say, we are not yet at the point of the end of the line, if you will, on our ability to reduce lead times. So it's a mix, and we will, I think continue to see our total ability to ship more quickly improve over the coming years. And it's a function really of a couple of things. First is the way we handle long lead time inventory, parts that are used for the products. And as we in-source, we control those lead times much better than we do when we don't in-source, or we control it with a lot less inventory. So we will continue down that path. So I don't see that ending for a decade. The second point, though and what's probably driving it even more than the inventory the last six months to a year, is we've talked about our relative percentage of what I would call replacement orders versus the orders that are for large projects. And if you go back to the disastrous malaise of 2008, 2009 type timeframe, what we saw is the big projects that had steel in the ground, they had to go ahead. And so the percentage of our shipments going from big projects which typically have long lead times, we typically have those orders months in advance, not days or weeks in advance. That number ran up, if you will, to probably close to 40% of our capital equipment revenue. It typically runs kind of 70-30: 70% replacement orders – you know, I just want a new table, I just want a new light, give me three of these versus a large building project. And so what we saw in that time period, we saw a significant increase in the amount of project orders. Then you may recall, we've talked about this, that we saw the actual number of projects declining, but the size of the projects rising such that it basically held even. But then we saw replacements coming back so the percentages went back to their more normal cause. In our current business and pipeline, we're seeing those numbers running up more into the high 70%s, maybe even close to 80%, is replacement business versus projects. So their projects are falling on a percentage basis – actually on a dollars basis, now the projects have fallen out in the future, but the replacement business pipeline has risen. And that's why we have comfort that we will be able to grow revenue this coming year because we see much more replacement pipeline than we were seeing, even though the project pipeline has fallen off. And by definition, if the replacement stuff tends to be, give it to me as fast as you can, so our lead time drives that business, whereas the project is I'm going to place your order now, and give it to you in six months when my building is done. And then they miss that date by two months and so it's an eight-month timeframe, not a six-month timeframe. So that's the totality of what's driving those numbers. And I would not expect our backlog to fall in dollars significantly going forward as the business grows, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's a little bit. But I wouldn't expect large decreases over time, but it really depends on those two factors.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's extremely helpful. And then one other one, just to follow up. I mean obviously I know that you're extremely focused in on the closing of the acquisition of Synergy and recognize the constraints that you have on what you can talk about. But if you put Synergy aside, and maybe at a high level, help us think about strategically and financially what you guys are really focused in on for the coming year, I guess, in the if you will the core STERIS business?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Taking Synergy aside, the comments I made actually capture it. We've got a pretty strong organic growth profile sitting in front of us. We have a lot of product development sitting in front of us. We continue the completion of the work of in-sourcing some of the products or parts for products that we build as well as, you know we have a significant restructuring and, moving the products, the System 1 products that had its own dedicated plant into some other plant, so we can restructure that. So that is clearly, there's a lot of work going on in the operations of the business which are basically around increasing the quality we have, putting new products in place that our customers like and reducing the cost and bringing more control over it by in-sourcing manufacturing, and we continue to do that. Now it's not like we've announced a few big $10 million kind of projects. Now they look more like 100 points of light, not one big glowing sun. But you'll continue to see that. Some of that profitability we capture and some of that profitability we pass onto our customers both in terms of better quality and delivery as well as some more cost. There's a lot of cost pressure in this business right now that you know. So I would say, at a high level that's the work. I've talked a little bit in each of the segments about what they're doing, but at a high level that's probably the best conversation. And then on the business development side, just because we're working on Synergy, the universe doesn't stop other companies. So we continue to look at things. And in fact after we close the Synergy deal, we and they will have more opportunities, we think, because it expands our opportunity set. So we are clearly watching that. And of course that will somewhat depend – if you only do so much, that will somewhat depend on when everything closes. But we continue to look down that front. So I guess the closing comments I made about our disciplined investment strategy pretty much summarizes it, but kind of at a more definitive level that's what we're looking at.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Terrific. Appreciate the thoughts.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Cooley with Stephens. You may begin.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you and I appreciate you taking the questions here this morning. Let me follow up on Larry's lead question and I had one other. Walt, could you maybe just give us a little bit more color about the end market that you're seeing here in the States? Certainly appreciate how the backlog is changing and lead times are changing, but can you just talk to us about just maybe sentiment from your end market customers a little bit here in the U.S. is maybe that will help us better frame up kind of the capital, consumable breakout for fiscal 2016 for my modeling purposes. Then I have just one quick follow up.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. And your points were well asked in terms of, I'll call it the consumable versus the capital side. So let me talk about consumable ongoing revenue type sources and then maybe on the capital side. First of all, the early part of this calendar year, the weather just created all kinds of havoc in the system, so January in a lot of places was pretty tough for hospitals and surgery centers and people that do our kind of work, and endoscopy centers. And so we clearly saw – and we see that – they saw in terms of cancellation of procedures and movement and then a lot of the hospitals got filled up with flu patients and so although they had a lot of patients in beds, they may have not had been doing as many procedures as they would have otherwise. So we kind of saw some of that early on in the year, weather dominated the eastern half of the country. And then the supply chain gets filled up because they're expecting more and it takes a little while for them to use up their inventory, and then they buy. So we saw a little bit of, I'll call it, disruption of what was otherwise a more normal steady process. I think we're through that. As best we can tell, we're through that and it looks to us like things are kind of "back to normal". Most of the facilities that I see, we see a number of people coming into STERIS to talk to us about projects they're doing or work they're doing. Most of the people I'm seeing are telling me they're busy and they're full. And so it seems like that we have seen some pickup there, here the last three months or so – or after we got through the kind of January, first half of February malaise. And it sort of seems that way across the board, this is not a detailed survey by the way, I'm talking about people that I'm talking to. It's a lot of people, but it's not a thousand. So that's kind of one side of it. So on the consumable side, it looks to us like steady growth. On the capital side, we are seeing, as I said, the pipeline in total is trending slightly upwards in our best estimate, and I'm talking single digit percentages now. But the mix has clearly mix shifted toward the replacement of individual devices or a few devices at a time as opposed to the large building projects that seems to have slowed down. Now if you look out even further, I'm talking to my architect friends and my architect friends are saying, I like to talk to them because they're busy two years before I'm busy, and they seem to be picking up as well, which is a good thing. But they also are seeing this mix of, it's a lot of smaller projects more than one big project kind of thing. But I think that may be a little bit of a longer term trend, at least for our side of the business. I can't speak to the capital outside of the ORCSD (29:50) kind of areas. I think, Chris that kind of wraps up North America. Now for our piece of the world, Europe seems to be kind of holding its own. That is it's not growing real fast, it's not dying. A lot of that – Europe for us includes the Middle East. The Middle East is stronger than the European continent. And so when you average that together, we're seeing some growth. We are seeing, have seen, and continue to see strength in Asia Pacific. We've been that way now for, I don't know, four to eight months kind of – excuse me, four to eight quarters kind of timeframe that we've seen our Asia Pacific business picking up relative to the others. And our Latin America business has been soft. Looking out in the future, we think we're seeing some pick up there, but it has been soft. And it's going to be soft for another quarter or so until we see that pick up coming through.
Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: That's a great answer. Really do appreciate that. And just my quick follow-up either for yourself or for Mike, or both. When you think about the guidance and certainly understand kind of the transition that we're in right now with the Synergy merger pending. But when we look at just the core STERIS topline guidance for fiscal 2016, not to be glass is half empty, but help us think a little bit of why that number isn't higher as you alluded to in your prepared remarks, you have a strong new product cadence on the capital side. Does seem to appear that some of these in-market trends are at least neutral to favorable. Help us maybe understand a little bit more about why that topline aspect of the P&L guide isn't just a little bit more robust? And I'll get back in queue. Thanks so much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Chris. I think we've said for a pretty long time that we expect the market in general to be growing in the low-to-mid single-digits, 4%, 5%. And we would expect organically to grow a little faster than that 5%, 6%, 6%, 7%, pick a number. And so I think our forecast is reflective of that. This is essentially organic growth. And so I think our forecast is reflective of that. Also the headwind of the international revenue next year is going to be in the $25 million range, so that clearly is not helping out. And so if you add that back in, you get another point or so. And the next thing you know it looks like fairly robust growth. And so I think it is good solid growth estimate. If currency takes a different twist, it would change that revenue profile. But I think that's pretty much it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, Walt, Mike, Julie. Thank you, guys, for taking my questions and good morning.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Matt.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Morning.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And just to follow up on Chris' question on the guidance. So currency looks as if it's about 100 basis points to 150 basis points. What about on the acquisition front, I'm just trying to get a sense of what you guys look at, is that 5% to 6% constant currency and organic, just trying to get a sense for what that is? I believe there's a little bit of IMS in there. Were there any other small bolt-on acquisitions in the quarter as well – or throughout the course of the year?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean that 5% to 6% growth is including the effect of currency. So it would have been up another point or two, I don't know the exact number. But up another point or two if it were in a constant currency range. And then that's one of the things that people forget. That's just the way accountants look at it mathematically. But when your cost go up 20%, that constant currency stuff is on the business you actually get. When your costs go up 20% versus a currency, you lose business too. So it's actually a stronger headwind than when you do the accounting – than the accounting shows, because there's business you just don't get. And some of that is because you lose to local companies and some of that is because the customers wait until they can afford to spend the money, so put that piece out there. In terms of acquisitions, there's a few weeks, four to five weeks, I think of IMS. So that's a small amount, probably half-a-point or something like that. And there's a dribble, maybe, of tiny, tiny deals. But they're deals mainly in the IMS area and they're deals we consider them organic because they're small enough it's literally the same as if we went out and bought three trucks and hired 10 people. They are that size a deal. So whether we go out and hire 10 people and buy three trucks, or we do an asset buy of a very small company, to us looks like the same thing, so we consider that organic. And it would be trivial in your numbers.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And then last quarter you talked about smoothing out your Healthcare capital equipment sales. How successful were you with that and what do you think the impact of some of that smoothing was on the quarter?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, last year we didn't do a very good job of that and that's why – we did a better job the previous year. But we have a ways to go there and it would be far better if our capital equipment sales were a function purely of customer demand, not a function of our plan years. And that's an objective that many, many companies are working on, as are we, and we're going to try to get better at it because it's better for our factories to run in a more even mode. Now what we have done, we can handle some of that with inventory. So we build inventory over the course of the third quarter and into the early fourth and we ship some. But still, we'd be better for it. We are going to be working on that again this year. That's why you see the profitability splits that you see are more front end weighted than last year and – than the year before, but they are not as front end weighted – they are not as even as I would like. If you're a growing business, you expect the first half to be smaller than the second half. Ours is a little too heavy on the second half, and it's largely that capital, year-end capital shipments.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just last one for me and then I'll jump back in queue. I think you mentioned that the costs for disposal of cobalt-60 were going to be increasing this year. Is that a regulatory cost that's going up or is that something that's coming from Nordion? And has there been any update on potentially being able to dual source cobalt?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's actually a function, not of our Nordion cobalt where we have long-term contracts, but from our other supplier. And as a result, since we at this point cannot be assured that we will be purchasing from them, we have to take care of the disposal, since as I mentioned in my discussion before, the disposal if you will was part of the purchase price in our thinking. As long as we bought the next load, they disposed of the last one. Since we are no longer can be assured that they will be here to do that, then we need to set up a reserve. Because we can get it disposed either by them or by Nordion or someone else. And so that's the cause for that reserve. How that ends up, I think we're being appropriately conservative in doing that. How that all ends up, if we're a little bit luckier we will be able to take care of that. But it's not at all the Nordion issue. It is the other supplier.
Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. You may begin.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Thanks. I think you mentioned that FX was positive to EPS in fiscal 2015 by $10 million. I was wondering do you have an estimate of what that will be to EPS in fiscal 2016.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Orders of magnitude, about the same. And again, I have to reiterate that's the way it looks when you do all the math, but the additional business we would have received around the world, we would have made money on it. It just doesn't show up in the calculations. So if you look at the straight math on the business that we will achieve, or we expect to achieve, it would be about $10 million.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: And I know that your standalone guidance might not be the most important thing here, but kind of at the midpoint it looks like 8% earnings growth. I know you guys historically look for double digit, given that you have that FX kind of tailwind. I guess what do you think could help you either get to that 10% for the year or what is new this year outside of no deals in the guidance that kind of would keep you a little more subdued?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. In the middle of our guidance, as you say, is right around the 8% range. And that would be our kind of normal long-term expectation, because we do expect a portion of that double digit growth to come from acquisitions, and so at a high level that's kind of what we've said, mid-single-digits in revenue growth, get a point or two out of profitability improvement on that expanding revenue and then you've got to get a point or two out of acquisitions – out of business development. So at a high level, it's pretty much all on our long-term expectations. As you might expect, we don't like to hit the bottom of our range and we don't like to hit the middle of our range. We like to hit the top of our range. We get paid a lot more if we hit the top of our range, so we like to get there. And if we are unable to do deals in this timeframe, we'll be pushing hard to get up to the top of the range, but I think the range is a reasonable estimate of what our future looks like. I think it is consistent with our long-term expectations.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Could you remind us too of the interest rate on the $1.25 billion, if that's set?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Yes, Dave, we have entered into agreement with about 14 banks for the new credit facility and that variable rate is about 1.5% on the $1.25 billion.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Great, and last one for me, and I may get shot down here. But you highlighted two scenarios in your M&A transaction, the filing. I was just curious if you could even say did you contemplate currency at all in terms of synergies? The estimates, the range you have there in terms of their future outlook?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We contemplated currency as it was at that time.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: You couldn't tell us what those rates were could you? Would you be able to?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I believe that's disclosed in the S-4.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Okay.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I believe it's $1.61.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: $1.61 to be exact is the rates that we used in our analysis.
David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC: Perfect. Thank you so much.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: You're welcome.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Hello, everybody. You mentioned earlier incremental invested capital associated with Isomedix. Can you elaborate on that? Is that just related to cobalt disposal or is there a facility expansion? And would that bump the CapEx spend? Would that change with the closing of the Synergy deal?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm going to answer – I guess there's three questions in there. First question is that CapEx, there is routine CapEx for cobalt spending and that is not out of the ordinary in our plan. The bump-up is all associated with expansion of facilities. And so it is truly an expansion of facilities. Now when you expand facilities, if you're expanding gamma facilities, you know there's some cobalt buy, so you have to mix all that together. But in general, that is an expansion of facilities, not an expansion of cobalt. We have expanded our cobalt – our gamma facilities over the past year or two, so there is more routine buy because of those expansions. But the significant over-spending relative to the last year or two is expansion of facilities. Yes, I've now forgotten the second half of the question, Erin. I'm sorry.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I guess would that bump to the CapEx change if you close the Synergy deal?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Clearly, what we will spend in those facilities is completely independent of the Synergy deal. They are virtually non-existent in North America. So what we are spending in North America is independent of that. But we would expect CapEx to rise if we do the Synergy deal because they have the same issues that we do. They have routine spending in gamma and then they are expanding outside the United States on a routine basis. So it would be similar and I think it's easy to go back and look at their – we haven't forecast that per se, but if you go back and look at their CapEx and look at the S-4, I think you would find relevant information there.
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: And, Erin, just one point of clarification. The disposal cost of the depleted cobalt does not go into capital expenditures. It's actually a period expense. So that will be recognized through cost of goods sold as an expense.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And what's driving the faster improvement in IMS margins? Is it just quicker consolidation of what's left on integration front, and how would this business fit into the broader global platform next year?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, Erin. I would say there are two factors. And I'm going to separate the financial result from the operational piece a little bit. That is a big piece of the financial result, as we've discussed before, was we – that is the various companies of IMS – were outsourcing to other people things that they didn't do well. Most of these companies were either very good at surgical instrument repair or very good at scope repair, rarely both. And so what happened is the guys that were good at instrument repair tended to sub out their scope repair and vice versa. The beauty is we bought a couple companies that were good at one and a couple companies good at other, so we in-sourced their outsourcing to each other. And that happened, we expected it to be pretty quick, it happened really quick. And so there was enough capacity in the labs and we were able to beef up the labs. We really got that impact very fast. And then the second piece is the more difficult, long-term work, which is overlapping territories and do we have enough people? Again, as a service business, you need to have geographic density, if you will, to be at an optimum level of profitability. And again, all these companies were regional light (46:29) companies, and so they were all trying to expand outside their regions when we put them together. Places one was expanding, the other already was and so we got much better regional density. That has taken longer. And then the whole back office, IT and getting all the regions aligned. Sometimes we had three people where we needed two when we put them together; sometimes we had two people where we needed three. Getting them all in the right geographies, that has taken longer, and we're effectively through that as we speak, actually. We're kind of finishing that up now. But the financial result is less impactful than this outsourcing. So we were able to get there quicker than we thought and we're hitting the targets that we expected. And so we think we're in good shape. Now this coming year we actually will continue to improve, but we'll also begin some more investing for growth in the business. So we're not expecting a significant differential this year because we do expect to continue to grow that business. We expect to be a high-single digit, low-double digit grower and we'll have to invest to do that.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Good morning.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations & Head-Media Relations: Good morning.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Just looking at the Healthcare segment, the operating income talked in the release about an increase in R&D expense. What was that percentage increase on a year-over-year basis and how should we look at that going forward?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Yes, Jason, what we typically look at, and I don't have that percentage right off the top of my head, but what we anticipate is about 3% of revenue being spent on R&D and I don't think that changes in 2016 and beyond at this point in time.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And just looking at the numbers here, on the...
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But it is growing faster than revenue, so if it was 2.8%, it's now 3.1%. It's that kind of effect because, again, it's relatively small numbers, but it is growing faster. My recollection is it's growing in the mid- to high-single digits.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: All right. That's helpful. The foreign revenues in the quarter, what was the performance year-over-year on a constant currency basis?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: For the quarter, if I look at where we grew internationally, North America we saw about 14% top line growth, but the rest of the world we saw negative growth, Europe about 16%, APAC about 8% and then, as Walt mentioned earlier, we continue to struggle a little bit in Latin America. That was down about 30% for the quarter.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: All right. And then in reference to the savings you expect in fiscal 2016 from in-sourcing and restructuring? I think you had said previously $4 million to $6 million on the in-sourcing and $5 million on the restructuring. Is that still about the same?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. We're exactly right on target there.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: All right. And finally, the Healthcare segment, would you happen to have an organic figure for the quarter?
Michael J. Tokich - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP: Organically, Healthcare was down mid-single digits or low-single digits, sorry, low-single digits organic. And it was really driven by the capital being down 7%.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Thanks very much.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Your line is now open.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Yes, hi. Good morning. Walt, you did mention that you expect a number of new products to come on stream this year, and sounded particularly excited about the Endoscopy line. I was just wondering if you expect these new products from a competitive standpoint to be fairly meaningful or is it more rounding out the existing offering?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: U.S. Endoscopy, the way they work is trying to find new problems that haven't been solved and develop niche products for those new problems or maybe old problems with new solutions. And so most of the product that they have is a very targeted product, so it's not so much I'll call it a market share play. There is a problem out there and we can fix it, and if we do that, we can make some money doing so. So I would characterize their product portfolio that way. Having said that, there are groups of procedures that to the extent you have four or five or six products focused toward the care and cleaning of the device, and four or five or six products toward finding and retrieving polyps, for example, or finding and retrieving other things. And so they do cluster them that way and they are filling out those clusters. So to the extent that's what – I don't think of it as much as a head-to-head competition on any particular products, generally. It's generally more of a how can we fill out a portfolio of things for a certain set of procedures, and they are doing a very nice job of doing that.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Thanks. And you've pretty much baked that into the guidance for fiscal 2016, or is that more a longer-term play?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it is both. That is if you look at the class – we kind of look at classes of products. We have four, five, six, seven a year come out. And indeed the FY 2016 portion is factored into 2016, but really 2016 is being impacted more by the 2014 class and the 2015 class. There will be some impact from the 2016 class but we will see even more impact in 2017 and beyond.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. And then just a quick question on acquisitions. Ex-Synergy, as you look at potential opportunities in the marketplace, the one thing I've been hearing is valuations have become a little more frothy, so to speak. I was wondering if you're seeing the same thing in the areas you're looking at?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, market valuations in general are high, higher than they were – I don't know if it's high or low – but they are higher than they were a couple years ago for sure. Interest rates are lower. And when you put those two things together, you get what you get. And so I do think we see some high valuations. We work to be careful to pay only what we think we need to to get the thing done and we work to make sure that we don't have alternative ways of making more money, including buying our own shares back. So, we try to be very careful with that and we are an ROIC-driven company. We pay attention for return on capital, not just the earnings growth. But we are seeing some more steam, of course. And again, as long as you see these relatively low interest rates, I think you may see some of that.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks again for taking the questions.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet.
Operator: You have a follow-up question from Ms. Erin Wilson with Bank of America. You may begin.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. Just going back to U.S. Endoscopy, for 2016, what's incorporated into your guidance there and I know you don't break it out, but just anecdotally has anything changed in the trajectory at all there?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Erin, anecdotally, we had a five-year plan for U.S. Endoscopy and they have been hitting or beating that plan year after year. If they hit what we have incorporated into our guidance, they will have hit their five-year plan in four years.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And this is maybe a broader one, but how does the recent superbug outbreak in California influence you at all?
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, there's a number of superbugs, but I think you're talking about the scope bug in California that's gotten a lot of press.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right.
Walter M. Rosebrough - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's not 100% clear how that's going to affect all of us. First of all it is a very, very tiny piece of the work we do. This is specific to a particular bug and a particular set of scopes called duodenoscopes, some people call them duodenoscopes and so if you look at our piece of that action, it is teeny tiny. Or look at that in total in terms of any kind of broad percentage, it's tiny. It is in our business teeny tiny. Now if you're one of those patients, it's not tiny. It's (55:43) important. And we are working with the scope manufacturers. We're clearly in discussion with the various societies that help determine how we do this, and we clearly would be working with the agency to the extent that they are doing anything. So, we will be involved in this and we think we are a contributor. I will say that none of these reported issues have been on our devices. So at this point in time, we've not seen any direct impact. I think that it's a more indirect impact of how we will look at doing a better job with those devices as a collective group in the future.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: I'm showing no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back for closing remarks.
Julie Winter - Director-Investor Relations & Head-Media Relations: Great. Everybody, this concludes our call. Thanks again for joining us and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our third quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Walt will provide his commentary on our performance and discuss our outlook for the full fiscal year. As usual, our comments this morning will focus on adjusted results. Please see the reconciliation table included in our press release for additional details. We are pleased to report another strong second quarter with total company revenue growth of 17%, driven by a 4% increase in organic volume and a 14% increase from the IMS and Eschmann acquisitions, offset somewhat by currency fluctuations which negatively impacted revenue by 1%. Pricing was neutral to revenue in the third quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter increased 130 basis points to 41.7%. Gross margin was positively impacted by favorable product mix and foreign currency somewhat offset by higher material costs and inflation. The EBIT margin expanded 90 basis points to 16.3% of revenue. The improvement in EBIT margin was driven by higher organic volumes and improved gross margins, offset higher research and development expenses during the quarter. We still anticipate that R&D spending for the full fiscal year will be approximately 3% of total company revenue. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.1% compared with 39.9% last year. During the quarter, we had a favorable EPS impact of $0.02 from the enactment of the tax extenders. This benefit will not recur in the fourth quarter. Our full year effective tax rate is anticipated to be approximately 35.5%. Net income increased 37% to $47.7 million or $0.79 per diluted share compared with $34.9 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. Moving on to our segment results, healthcare had a good quarter growing revenue 21% in total of which 3% was organic. Healthcare service revenue grew 60% driven by acquisitions and 5% organic growth. Consumable revenue increased 12%, all of which was organic. Healthcare organic capital equipment performance was mixed, with strength in the infection prevention business unit, offset by declines in the surgical solutions business unit. Overall, healthcare capital equipment grew 1% in total and declined 5% organically. We believe that performance of healthcare capital equipment is mainly a matter of timing and anticipate that the surgical business unit will have strong shipments in the fourth quarter. Healthcare backlog at the end of the quarter was $137.8 million, an increase of 18%, sequentially and our highest level this year. As we discussed last quarter, we have been successful in reducing our manufacturing lead times which allows us to fulfill orders on a timelier basis compared to prior years. We remain comfortable with our level of backlog and quoting activity heading into the fourth quarter. Healthcare operating margins increased 70 basis points to 13.6% of revenue. The increase in operating income year-over-year was driven by volume, favorable product mix and currency fluctuations, somewhat offset by pricing and inflation. Life Sciences revenue grew 6% in the third quarter. We experienced continued strength in our consumables franchise with revenue growth of 16%. Service revenue grew 4% and capital equipment revenue were flat during the quarter. As we have said for several quarters, we anticipate that it will be a challenging year for capital equipment sales within Life Sciences. Our full year outlook for Life Sciences capital equipment revenue continues to be a mid-single-digit decline due to reduction of orders by both pharma and research customers. Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $44 million, in line with our historic levels. Life Science’s third quarter operating margin increased 530 basis point, 24.2% of revenue. This strong performance was driven by favorable product mix and disciplined operating expense management. Isomedix had another good quarter with 4% revenue growth driven by demand from our core medical device customers. While the rate of growth has slowed somewhat in this segment, we had a challenging comparison versus the prior year and incurred downtime in the quarter due to plant shutdowns for maintenance and upgrades. Isomedix operating margin was 27.5% of revenue, a decrease of 170 basis points as compared with the prior year caused mainly by higher quality regulatory expenses. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a $147.4 million of cash and $610.7 million in long-term debt. Our DSOs at the end of the quarter were 60 days, a two-day improvement compared with the prior year. Our free cash flow for the first nine months of the fiscal year was $109.3 million, an increase of $27.1 million compared with the prior year driven by working capital improvements and lower capital expenditures. Capital spending was $20.2 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $21.6 million. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Walt for his remarks. Walt.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. When we look at our progress so far this year, we have much to be happy about. SERIS people have focused on serving our customers while integrating one significant acquisition and working to close another one and have delivered improved performance with each subsequent quarter. As Mike has already discussed, we continued our progress in the third quarter with meaningful revenue growth and continued bottom line improvement. Since Mike has already covered the quarter, my comments are going to focus on our year-to-date performance and outlook. So far this year, we have grown total revenue 17% with 22% growth in healthcare, 2% in Life Science and 6% in Isomedix. We continue to hear more optimism from our hospital customers in terms of procedure volumes and capital spending for calendar year 2015. So we are encouraged about the short to intermediate-term. Our healthcare segment has experienced double digit revenue growth in consumables, reflecting continued success on our cleaning chemistry and growing the pro consumable franchise, as well as double digit growth from U.S. endoscopy. In addition, healthcare service revenue has also grown nicely due to the high single digit organic revenue growth and the acquisition of IMS. This increase is consistent with our hospital customers’ comments on procedure volumes. On the IMS front, we are making good progress on the integration of the five instrument repair businesses under the IMS brand. And we’re pleased with our performance today. Margins for the combined business contain to improve as we do more in-house under the combined umbrella of our larger network. And we are making significant progress toward our long-term margin goals. From a healthcare capital equipment perspective, our performance today is somewhat mixed, with solid growth in infection prevention capital equipment and flat performance in surgical, resulting in total capital equipment revenue growth in the low single-digits. As you all know, capital equipment shipments tend to vary from time to time. We’re a bit behind our expectations in surgical so far this year, but are expecting sequential improvement for a strong surgical fourth quarter, partially driven by new products. Looking at operating margins, healthcare has improved sequentially throughout the year and has demonstrated improvement in line with our expectations today. The story with Life Science hasn’t changed much during the course of this year as we continue to see strength in consumable and service revenue, offset by a challenging environment for capital equipment. We have experienced stabilization in capital equipment and continue to believe that our performance is a function of lower overall customer demand. Our Life Science team had particularly strong profitability in the third quarter as we had significant consumables revenue growth, favorable mix within our capital equipment sales and good operating expense leverage. We are very pleased with this operating margin attainment for the quarter, but do not believe it is indicative of future quarters. Our Life Science product portfolio has expanded this year as we leverage our knowledge and expertise in vaporized hydrogen peroxide across our businesses and having a produced a new VHP-based sterilizer in this segment. Isomedix is having a solid year as we fill capacity invest in the business. We continue to anticipate mid single-digit revenue growth for the full fiscal year. As we’ve discussed all year, operating margins for Isomedix were down somewhat due primarily to quality and regulatory spending which we expect to anniversary at the end of this fiscal year. From an overall profitability perspective, our total company operating margins have progressed nicely throughout the year as we anticipated, as we reap the benefits of cost reduction programs put in place in prior years. Our previously announced insourcing projects have also contributed to our profitability this year. We continue to expect additional savings next year from both of these actions. That brings us to our outlook for the year. As you all know, we began the year with high expectations for our performance in fiscal 2015. And we are pleased to be on track. To that end, we are confirming our last quarter’s narrowing of earnings guidance to the high end of our original outlook, which puts us at $2.86 to $2.91 for the year. We continue to expect the strong bottom line performance with total company revenue growth of about 15% for the full year. Let me get into a little more detail. We expect to experience nice sequential top line growth and operating profit expansion in the fourth quarter. However, given our extraordinary performance in the fourth quarter of last year, we have tough comparisons from a year-over-year perspective for Q4. We expect a number of factors to impact the Q4 year-over-year comparison. First, we work to better level load our capital equipment shipments to reduce the hockey stick effect we often see in the fourth quarter. As a result, we will see a greater percentage of our year-over-year growth for the remainder of the year coming from the acquisition of the IMS franchise, which is currently below our corporate average operating margin rates. In addition, we anticipate increased management incentive compensation expenses in the fourth quarter compare to last year based on the expected overachievement of our goals. Finally, moving to business development, we continue to work diligently on the close of the synergy acquisition. From a regulatory perspective, we have now filed two S-4 amendment fee. We have officially filed with the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. and anticipate a response by early March. And we have received a second request from the FTC. As we’ve already said, we continue to work toward the March 31 closing date. But the FTC second request may cause us to extend beyond that time. We believe we will close this transaction and are excited about our future together. With that, I will turn the call back to Julie to open for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Walt, for your comments. We’re now ready to being the Q&A. So Jane, would you please give the instructions and we’ll get started.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Dave Turkaly: Hey, thanks a lot. Just quickly, I know - we’ve been waiting for a while for the deal to close. I was just curious, does any of your business - so do you think any of your fundamentals are being impacted at all by, say, the fact that the deal was coming to a close soon? What are specifically at your kind of core business and backlog in healthcare or even anything on your sales force? I’m just curious if you’ve seen any changes or any impact given that that transaction is hopefully coming to a close soon.
Walt Rosebrough: This is Walt. And I don’t think that we’re any significant impact there. Our field forces are largely separate. We don’t have significant geographic overlap at this time, don’t have a lot of product overlap. So generally speaking, I would say there’s no impact in all the work at this point at the senior executive level. So I don’t see much impact there.
Dave Turkaly: And then in the healthcare, I think the capital part, I think you mentioned that you might have some new products kicking in in the fourth quarter. Could you maybe hit on a couple of those for us?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. We always have new products coming by the way, always have incoming and we’re always introducing. We don’t spend a lot of time talking about all of them. But particularly on the surgical side, we have both the two or actually three principal products that are ceiling-based products. We have new lights that we’re introducing as we speak. We have new what we call Booms or equipment management systems which we are - when I say introducing, we’re shipping as we speak. And then we have also a new OR integration system that is I should say relatively new, the last couple of months. So you put all that together and we truly have a number of new systems hitting the field on the surgical side as we speak.
Dave Turkaly: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Matt Mishan: Hey, great. Thank you for taking my questions. I get how the fourth quarter is going to be a tough comp especially off of last year. What’s driving the decline in the full year sales guidance to ’15 from ’15 to ’17. And also, in your S-4, it indicated that you guys thought you could do a little bit over ’17 for the year.
Walt Rosebrough: Well, I would say, Matt - oh, good morning, Matt, sorry.
Matt Mishan: Good morning.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, this is Walt. I would say, in general, at the highest level, it’s where we are year-to-date that’s driving that conclusion where we are just a little bit off. And we’re not looking for the big hockey stick that we saw at the end of last year in the particularly on the capital equipment side. As I’ve said, we are expecting a very strong surgical quarter. We had a super strong surgical for the last year. And we also had a super strong IPT capital last year. We’ll see I think a more normalized IPT and a very strong surgical, is what our current belief is.
Michael Tokich: Hey, Matt. This is Mike. One other additional piece too is FX is definitely a headwind for us. And we anticipate that being close to 1%, around 1% in the full year. And that is actually driving the ’15 to ’17 closer to ’15 also.
Matt Mishan: Okay, got it. And just a bigger picture type question. Could you guys talk a little bit about the puts and the takes and maybe the prospects for E-beam technology versus Gamma or ethylene oxide and how your customers are kind of looking at it for like new and existing products?
Walt Rosebrough: There’s a lot of detailed technical description there. But there are a number of ways to radiate. You kind of have to break sterilization of that type into two broad categories, gas and radiation. There are some products, it could be done both. But generally speaking, they’re naturally better either because of the design or because of the packaging they are naturally better with either gas or radiation. There’s a number of ways to do radiation. Clearly, the broadest and most accepted is Gamma, but there are opportunities for more different types of radiations, both E-beam and x-ray type radiations. And it’s not at all that those are, what do you want to call them, mutually replaceable. But there are some products that you can do in either. There are some products that look better in one versus the other. But clearly, Gamma is the dominant modality at this point in time.
Matt Mishan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Erin Wilson: Great. On the organic growth, I was a little delighted than I would have anticipated. How would you characterize just the current utilization environment as it relates to capital equipment purchasing and surgical procedure volumes?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. Erin, good morning. I would say, they’re broken into two categories. Our organic growth on consumables has stayed strong and that is what is more tightly linked to procedural volumes in the short-term. And the longer-term capital is linked, but it’s linked based on combination of the near-term. If they’re making more money, they’re naturally more willing to invest capital also in terms of certainty, uncertainty. And so it’s linked, but it’s not as tight a link and it tends to be a lagging factor, not an immediate factor. And so first, that’s the beginning. And in healthcare, our tightly linked things are consumables and service are tracking as you would expect, maybe even a little better than you would expect. Then when you turn to capital, you may recall the last couple of years, we have been stronger than most of the other people on the capital equipment side. And partially, we think we did okay. But partially, it’s because of where we’re concentrated. And we’ve always said that in bad times, the OR and to a lesser extent, but to some extent, the CSD tends to continue to spend capital because it’s a revenue-generating part of the service if you will of a hospital, whereas maybe some of the other areas might not stay quite as strong. And I think we’ve seen that if you look across the other manufacturers and see who kind of got weaker early and who is now bouncing back more. You’re seeing the other areas outside I think be a little bit stronger. So they are linked and I do think we’re optimistic the things we’re seeing - I call it the forward indicators that we look at, bids and orders and that kind of stuff, we are feeling more and more optimistic. We’ve been pretty much saying that things are - we’ve been cautiously optimistic, stable to slightly increasing. I think we might be feeling even a little better now for the longer-term. But that takes time and there is lumpiness in between there. I’d say that’s a high level, Erin, that’s probably what we’re seeing.
Erin Wilson: Okay. That’s great color. And on deal timing, can you give us some greater clarity on what you’re anticipating? And does it mean that you’re expectations are sort of the status quo here from where they were before? And what are the types of conversations you are having with the FTC and is the FTC delimiting the ages [ph] here for as far as deal closing goes or are there other factors we should be thinking about?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, Erin, our - I’ll start out with our general approach to comment on conversations with regulators. It’s our experience that having those conversations and having those conversations private and keeping them private so no one gives to read about them in the paper and misinterpret either because you misinterpreted us or they misinterpret you. But that we’re better off just saying that we’re in conversation with the appropriate agencies and we kind of leave it at that until there is a significant event. And when we have those, we announce them. Any regulatory agency that we are working with, that tends to be our approach. As it relates to this, clearly we had originally expected that we would get closed by March 31st, rough timeframe and we clearly are continuing to work toward getting close towards March 31st, rough timeframe. So we are not at all ready to come off that date. But with the FTC second request, which we do think that is now the gaiting factor of the various things one has to get done. When we look at our timing charts that that is moved to be the gaiting factor in our opinion. And we’re continuing to work with them. We have not given up on that schedule. And so we will continue to drive toward that until we find out that we can’t read them unless I should say unless, not until we find out that can’t read it. And our view is not that we’re talking about years of delay. We’re talking weeks and months, not - and hopefully days and weeks. But we’re not talking years. We’re talking days, weeks, months kind of delay from that March 31st timeframe.
Erin Wilson: Okay. That’s good to hear. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Larry Keusch: Thank you, good morning. Hey, Walt or Mike, I just want to come back to the quarter and the guidance. So you beat the EPS by $0.06 relative to the street consensus. You maintained your guidance for the year. So I guess the question is, was the quarter sort of as you anticipated and the streets gaiting was perhaps off in a way they were looking for the quarters or is there some level of conservatism potentially in that fourth quarter that you’re baking in?
Walt Rosebrough: Larry, I’m not sure that all that might in afterwards too. But I’m not sure where the street had baked the tax extenders. In our mind, it was the fourth quarter. We didn’t think it would get done before the December 31 timeframe. We expected it right after the first of the year. So that clearly was a change in our expectation. And we did have a couple of positive things that rolled in. So we did beat our expectation a little bit. So it would be fair to characterize that last year or last quarter, excuse me, when we narrowed our guidance to the high-end of the range, we felt okay with it when we did. And today, we feel better about it than we did it because, A, we’re further down the path. We not only made what we expected, but we beat what we expected. But as you know, two orders that fall outside of March 31 can take care of that a penny or two pretty quick. So we are very comfortable. We were comfortable on where we were. We are very comfortable now where we are. And we like where we are and we’re optimistic about the quarter and optimistic about the future.
Larry Keusch: Okay. That’s helpful. And I guess, just one other one for you is you talked a little bit about the integration of what is going on within IMS. Maybe you could drill down a little bit more and help us understand what specific activities are going on there. And then also remind us kind of what the margin goals are for that business longer-term as you pull forward all the integration activities and kind of where we are currently with the margins for the business.
Walt Rosebrough: Larry, I’m going to break the IMS conversation into, I call it three buckets. The work that’s going on in integration. Actually, I had fourth. So the one I always forget, Mike gets mad at me, because it’s the one they have to do. The first three are more around the field and the operations, originally the ones that I think of most quickly. But on the field side, field and operations side, first of all, we had a number - each of these entities had a number of different labs and repair centers and those kind of things. And yet particularly as you recall, several of the businesses were more focused on instrument repair which tends to be a local repair and several of the entities were more focused on scope empowered instruments repair which tends to be a repair that the device gets shipped in and done in a little factory, let’s call it or a lab. And as a result, the entities were outsourcing the others pieces of work because they didn’t have capacity, whichever the one they didn’t do. So kind of the first big step and a step we knew would be very positive. Was we are now insourcing the vast majority of that work to ourselves if you will. So we crossed that insourcing. And I would say, that is it may not, it’s no complete, but it’s well down the path. And that is the piece that we knew would be for lack of term, Slam dunk. The second piece, of that we are working on is insight and you feel you have a question or a guesser. You have a situation where even though in total, we probably had the right number of people to service roughly what we’re doing, in one city, we might have, I’m just going to make this up. In Omaha, we might have three people where we needed to. In Minneapolis, we might have two people where we needed three because of the way that we were centered. And so we are in the process and we’re fairly further down the path. We’re not completely down the path of making all those determinations and getting rightsized. It’s not that we’re changing the number of those folks. It’s just they’re not always in the right places. And so it will make those individuals far more efficient. They have less drive time, we get more - actually, we get more customer work done for less total work because we’re driving less. And that’s a second piece that we knew would happen. That’s a little harder piece of work and it’s taken a little more time. The third piece that we’re doing is since we had multiple people doing multiple things, some of them, as you would expect, did them better than others and vice versa. And so we’re trying to transfer the learning of the better processes across each of the companies. There, we are - each of the individuals really. There, we are just started, if you will. And we made progress there but we’ll continue to make progress. And the last piece is the integration of the backbone of the company, of the things like - this is the piece that I mentioned that Mike and his team typically work on, which is the financial systems, the IT systems, the internal mechanisms, if you will. And we are well down the path on getting that done. And so those are the components. None of them are what I would call complete. But we are well down the path on a couple and we may be halfway there on the others. In terms of the long-term for the pure repair side of the business, we’re looking at, in the long-term, getting that close to our average rates, something in the mid-teens kind of numbers rates. And we’re certainly not there yet but we think we have an opportunity to get there.
Larry Keusch: Perfect. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens. Your line is open.
Chris Cooley: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Two if I may here. Mike, could you help us a little bit first with Isomedix and just kind of help us get back to kind of a normalized margin for the business in the quarter? I understand there was the added expenditure there from a regulatory perspective but you also had the maintenance downtime. So I’m just trying to get a feel for what you’re seeing there in profitability and also growth on a go-forward basis in that space. And I have a follow-up.
Michael Tokich: Yes, Chris, on the Isomedix piece, the one thing that we continue to experience and we’ve talked about all year is we were going to have higher quality and regulatory expenses which, I think as Walt talked about, will anniversary at the end of this fiscal year. In total, that’s several million dollars - $2 million to $3 million in total. You could just divide that roughly equally on a quarterly basis and that’s part of the impact. The other part of the impact, obviously, is the shutdown of that maintenance which probably caused us a point or two on the revenue side. I mean, we continue to believe mid single-digits is the revenue growth for the full fiscal year. So we weren’t too far off. And then from a margin standpoint, we anticipate, as we have, the high 20s - 28%, 29% margin would be our normalized margin. We come above that and sometimes as volume increases as we hit significant drop-through. And then you can see when revenue does tail off a little bit, our expenses continue to come through. So I would say normalized, we’re in the upper 20s - 28%, 29%. And that’s something that we continue to use as our guidance for Isomedix both internally and externally.
Chris Cooley: Super. And I apologize, I had to go back and forth there. And you may have addressed this on Larry’s prior question, but when we just look at healthcare service growth, obviously very strong with the IMS acquisition there in the quarter of 38%. But when we just look at what we’ve seen from some of the providers as well as other capital players and your own backlog that grew nicely there during the quarter, those trends all would seem to afford an acceleration or at least a sustain of growth like we’re seeing right now in healthcare services. Just from a broader macro perspective, is that the way we should be thinking about this or are there other puts and takes that you think kind of gape in the growth of healthcare service on a go-forward basis? Thanks much.
Walt Rosebrough: Sure, Chris. And the healthcare services is a more complex topic right now. So you have to break it up into the IMS piece which you’ve already addressed. Obviously right now, that’s all new business, so it’s all growth. But going forward, we do see that still being a very strong grower, a high single-digit, low double-digit kind of grower. And we do expect that as long as the hospital trends remain in the same path, we expect to see that growth. On the what I call our traditional service serving our products, if you will, it’s a bifurcated answer. That is, when capital shipments rise, we get an immediate benefit from installation service rising. So that travels pretty much with capital equipment, more on the IPT side than on the surgical side. And then the second piece of that equation is, on the other hand, when they replace new equipment, if you had a real surge in equipment replacement, we typically are under warranty for a year. And so the service actually falls in that specific account. Now as long as it’s stable on a percentage basis, that’s largely irrelevant. But if you have a big surge, then you will see some drop-off for 12 months or so of service that is now free as opposed to - or under warranty as opposed to service going forward. But that’s a relatively brief phenomena and you go back to the service. Now to the other extent, if people really start holding their equipment, then it starts breaking down more and so we actually see more service. So you kind of have to look at that as a lifecycle. And I don’t see us right now any place in an odd part of the lifecycle. So again, to the extent capital keeps kind of trudging along at the same rate of growth of healthcare and you don’t see a big spike or decline, I would see service growing in the kind of the rate of healthcare growth as you’ve stated.
Chris Cooley: Super. And may I ask, please, one other quick one in here and then I’ll get back in queue?
Walt Rosebrough: All right, Chris.
Chris Cooley: Thanks so much. Just for clarity there, I want to make sure I heard this correctly. In terms of the second review from the FTC, do you still have deliverables to the agency or does synergy still have deliverables to the agency or is the ball now fully back in the FTC score? I’m just trying to think about it from a clock standpoint. Thanks.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes. Deliverables is a big word in terms of - even when the clock is running, then the deliverables - you still have ongoing conversations. They may ask for more things and even though it may not necessarily be required. Our experiences working with the agency is a good approach. But to answer your question, I think for what you are specifically asking is we do not have a new time clock at this point with a - I’ll call it a closed second filing completed with the agency. So I think that’s what you’re pointing to.
Chris Cooley: That’s great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.
Jason Rodgers: Good morning. You mentioned during the call about working to better level load your capital equipment shipment. Does that imply that some business could shift into the Q1 of next year?
Walt Rosebrough: The answer to your question is both directions. We do two things to better level load. Our favorite thing is if we shift the amount - the exact amount every quarter were the same except for the natural growth rate. So if you’re growing 5% a year, everything would be nirvana if we could figure out a way to grow 5% a quarter every quarter for the rest of our lives or whatever that number is. That doesn’t seem to be possible either from - there’s some lumpiness because of our customer side then there is some lumpiness that’s generated by our salespeople’s own targets and goals and all those things. And so we are working to try to level that out more. And you are correct. You can level both directions. And to the extent that’s possible and still meet customer expectation demand, it does level out. Mike’s pointed that out earlier and we have now for a year, so we worked hard to get to where we have quicker shipping time possibilities. And that helps us to level because part of the reason we have lumpiness is that you have three customers with three big projects and they’re all due in pick a month. And then three weeks before they’re supposed to be due, they call you up and say - our project is running five weeks behind, would you mind holding the stuff. So then I’ve got a factory full of finished goods waiting for a five-week from now delivery and I can’t move it to another customer. The more we can be building exactly what that customer is going to take and check in with them two weeks before and delivering in two weeks, the better we are able to shift that business around. And then lastly, we do, as we have this year, built inventory in anticipation of when we know we have several large orders as opposed to waiting and building five minutes before so we have to run our factories at overtime for a couple of months, that we try to build some of that ahead. So we build some things in anticipation. So it’s a mixture of all those things that come together. But we could see things pushing both directions as long as the customers are willing to do that. And they often have. It depends on the type of order. Project type things, it is very common for them to slip their timeframe. If you’ve ever built a house, it is just like that. Building a hospital is building a house on steroids. It’s a very complex project. And you’re building a house and ordering equipment and it is not uncommon or I would say - a better way to say it, it is more common than not that the timeframe slips. We build that into our thinking but you never know. Everyone’s a little different. Hopefully I’ve answered that clearly.
Jason Rodgers: Yes, thanks. And then just looking at the international markets, I wonder if you could detail the performance there. And the comments you had said earlier about increasing optimism for your customers, does that imply internationally as much as it does in the U.S.?
Walt Rosebrough: That varies by region, I would say. And we’ve continued to be strong in our EMEA business kind of counter trend a little bit. And so we have been a bit stronger than we would expect in EMEA. And our current looking is that, particularly our Middle East business continues to be strong on however you want to look at it, on a dollar rate or on a growth basis. So the EMEA business has continued to be strong. The commentary on the other two major regions is exactly the same as we’ve been saying for a couple of periods now. Latin America has been weak relative to its history. And part of that is the general economy and part of that is where we happened to be weak versus strong by country. And for example, we were very strong at Venezuela and Venezuela is a very difficult market right now. So our Latin America business is off. And it seems to be bottoming as opposed to growing but it seems to be better than maybe the last six months or year. But it’s still, relatively speaking, weak and our Asia Pacific market is, relatively speaking, strong. And the outlook tends to also be strong. So it varies by region but I think that’s a good characterization of three regions outside the U.S.
Jason Rodgers: Yes, thank you. And just finally, it looks like you purchased some shares back in the quarter. I’m just wondering if you had the number of shares that were purchased. Thank you.
Michael Tokich: Yes, we did not purchase any shares. What we did is we actually purchased some options or restricted shares that have vested. And what we do is we try and perform that execution internally for our employees. So it appears as if we are buying them, which we really are. But it’s not under our share repurchase authorization program that has been authorized by the board. I think there are still about $87 million outstanding under that authorization.
Jason Rodgers: Got it, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Your line is open.
Mitra Ramgopal: Yes, good morning. Just a couple of questions. Walt, I was wondering on the surgical repair business, clearly it’s been a couple of years since you’ve entered it and it having - continue to gain fair. Do you feel the need to make more acquisitions in that space or are you pretty much comfortable with what you have right now?
Walt Rosebrough: I would say we have moved from a strategic acquisition mode to an opportunistic acquisition mode. That is, we feel like we have in place what we need to fully do a very nice job for customers nationwide at this point. But there are a lot of players in this marketplace. And to the extent it makes sense for an owner and us to get together, we may do that.
Mitra Ramgopal: And from a big picture standpoint, just how you entered surgical repair, is there something similar that you could potentially do as you look out longer term?
Walt Rosebrough: Synergy.
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. Yes, that’s true.
Walt Rosebrough: And for the next 6 to 12 months, we’re busy. We’re not finished with the integration of IMS which is not a trivial piece of work. The guys are doing a great job. It’s not a trivial piece of work. And when we close on the Synergy acquisition, we will have significant work there, too. So it’s not that we will not do deals. We will do deals. And for the next little bit, I would expect them to be smaller relative to tuck-in deals, all things being equal. If there’s something that is just so strategic that we can’t pass and we can’t push it off, then we might consider it. But all things being equal, for the next little bit, we’ll be working to operationalize what we have already done. And then we will continue looking and continue thinking that at this point, there’s nothing I would point to in the horizon.
Mitra Ramgopal: Oh, thanks. And I don’t know if you can give us a quick update in terms of when you look back at the U.S. and after the acquisition where we stand with that today and what kind of growth you’re getting from that business.
Walt Rosebrough: We love the deal. It’s doing exactly what he had hoped, that is - I don’t know, exactly on plan. It’s either above or below. If anything, I would bet above what our thinking was. It’s really done a nice job. They continue with double-digit growth. The bulk of what we expected from that business was to continue product development and bring out innovative new products. They’ve continued to do that. They’re just working magnificently well. And we are exceedingly happy with the deal.
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. Thanks again.
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: Great. Everyone, thanks for joining us today and we’ll talk to you again next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Michael J. Tokich:  Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our second quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Walt will provide his commentary on our first half performance and discuss our outlook for the full fiscal year. As usual, our comments this morning will focus on adjusted results, please see the reconciliation table contained within our press release for additional details. We are pleased to report a strong second quarter with total revenue growth of 21%, driven by 6% increase in organic volume a 14% increase from the IMS and Eschmann acquisitions and 1% positive pricing impact. Foreign currency was neutral to revenue during the quarter, gross margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter increased 160 basis points to 14.1% gross margin was positively impacted by favorable product mix pricing, productivity and foreign currency somewhat offset by higher material costs and inflation. The EBIT margin expanded 60 basis points to 14.9% of revenue, the improvement in the EBIT margin was driven higher organic volumes improved gross margins and slightly lower R&D expenses, somewhat offset by higher incentive compensation expenses as compared with the prior year. In total, the second quarter, year-over-year impact of the higher incentive compensation expenses was just over $5 million which has allocated to each of the three segments as we normally do. The impact on segment operating margins in the quarter is somewhat muted, by positive items within the healthcare segment, but it is not offset within the Isomedix or Life Sciences segment. The effective tax rate of the quarter was 36.7% compared with 35.2% last year, during the quarter we had unfavorable discreet items, impact our effective tax rate. We continue to anticipate a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 35% which does include the assumed renewal of tax extenders. If the tax extenders are not approved, it could negatively impact our adjusted earnings per diluted share outlook for the full fiscal year by approximately $0.03. Even with a higher tax rate net income increased 24% to $40.6 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared with $32.6 million or $0.55 per diluted share last year. Moving on to our segment results Healthcare had a very good quarter growing 27% in total of which 8% was organic. Healthcare service revenue grew 64% driven by acquisitions and 10% organic growth. Consumable revenue increased 13% all of which was organic; lastly capital equipment revenue grew 9% of which 4% was organic with growth coming from both our infection prevention and surgical businesses. Healthcare backlog at the end of the quarter was $117 million a reduction of about 12%, despite our current level of backlog in Healthcare our outlook is bolstered by a strong pipeline for capital equipment. In addition we have been successful in reducing our manufacturing lead times, which allows us to fulfill orders on a timelier basis. Healthcare operating margins increased 200 basis points to 12.9% of revenue, the increase in operating income year-over-year was driven by volume, product mix, pricing and productivity offset by higher material costs. Life Sciences revenue grew 1% in the second quarter. We did experienced continued strength in our consumable franchise with revenue growth of 14%. Service revenue grew 4%, while capital equipment revenue declined 15% during the quarter. We continue to anticipate that it will be a challenging year for capital equipment sales within Life Sciences. Our full-year outlook for Life Sciences capital equipment revenue in a mid single-digit decline due to reduction of orders by both pharma and research customers. Backlog in Life Sciences end of the quarter at $46 million, and is in line with historic levels. Life Science’s second quarter operating margin of 22.4% of revenue is down slightly from the prior year, mainly driven by higher incentive compensation costs. Isomedix had another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth driven by increased demand from our core medical device customers. Isomedix operating margin was 28% of revenue a decrease of 160 basis points as compared to the prior year caused by higher quality and regulatory expenses and an increase in incentive compensation cost. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a $147.4 million of cash and $620 million of long-term debt. Our DSO is at 60-days, a one-day improvement as compared to the prior year. Our free cash flow for the first half of the fiscal year was $69.2 million an increase of $36.2 million compared with the prior year driven by working capital improvements and lower capital expenditures. Capital spending was $13.2 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $27.4 million. With that I will now turn the call back over to Walt for his remarks. Walt.
Walter M Rosebrough: Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. Since Mike has reviewed our quarterly results I will spend some time discussing our first half performance before turning to our full-year outlook. Our commentary on the first half is not all that different from the story for the second quarter. I would say that overall we are hearing more optimism from our healthcare customers on procedure volumes and hospital spending in recent months, which is benefiting our results in both Healthcare and in Isomedix. For the first half, we had revenue growth of 17% driven by Healthcare and Isomedix with Life Science about flat year-over-year. Within Healthcare, in addition to the acquisitions, we delivered mid single-digit organic revenue growth with increases in capital equipment, consumables and service. In the consumables franchise, we had growth across the board and particularly in our instrument cleaning chemistries such as Prolystica and our research sold product for high level disinfection in GI department. In addition we had nice gains in consumables relating to our growing installed base of our V-PRO brand hydrogen peroxide sterilizers and our in US Endoscopy GI products. From a Healthcare capital equipment perspective, we had mixed performance in the first half with double digit growth in infection prevention capital and flat performance in the surgical franchise. On the infection prevention side we again saw a good performance from our core products categories, steam sterilizers, washers and V-PRO. In fact, we have a new addition to our V-PRO family of products that we are excited about. We are pleased to have recently received FDA clearance to market V-PRO 60, the smallest of our line of hydrogen peroxide sterilizers. This product utilizes the same proprietary consumable as the rest of the V-PRO line, but has a smaller footprint and lower price point. We are just launching the product and remain optimistic about the continued success of this entire product family and the related recurring revenue stream. As you know, capital equipment shipments tend to vary from time-to-time and we are experiencing that in our surgical business. We are a bit behind our expectations for the first half of the year, but we are expecting a strong second half for that business, both sequentially and year-over-year. Our Healthcare service business is benefiting from the acquisition of IMS of course, but even beyond that our standard service business had shown high single-digit organic growth in the first half. Our integration plans with IMS continue to go very well and we are seeing signs of revenue and cost synergies coming through somewhat faster than we anticipated. We've recently adopted the IMS name for the five acquired businesses combined into our specialty service business unit. As a result, we have taken a $5.6 million non cash charge for reduction in valuation of the spectrum trade name in our GAAP earnings for the second quarter. This one-time non cash charge has been adjusted out of our earnings. In Life Sciences, we've had a similar story for some time now with a challenging environmental for capital equipment and continued revenue growth in consumables and in service. As Mike mentioned, we anticipate that the demand for Life Science capital equipment will remain challenging for the balance of the year, but we do expect a stronger capital second half compared with both last year and our first half. We believe that our performance today is a function of decreased overall demand versus competitive factors. Isomedix has had a solid first half growing revenue 8% as we continue to fill recently expanded capacity particularly in the northeast. Our capital expenditure plans for the full-year reflect continued investments to expand Isomedix capacity in order to meet increased demand from our core medical device customers. These projects are moving along as planned. We’ve made nice progress expanding our EBIT margin to the first half of the year and particularly in the second quarter, which as allowed us to exceed our expectations for earnings so for this year. As a result, we are revising our outlook for earnings for the full fiscal year to the upper end of our previously provided range. We now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share for the full-year in the range of $2.86 to $2.91. We are maintaining our revenue expectations of 15% to 17% growth for the full fiscal year. Although our Life Science capital revenue is not what we anticipated to the first half of the year and will likely fall somewhat sort of our original expectations for revenue. To be clear our total company outlook for the full fiscal year excludes any impact from the expected acquisitions of Synergy Health. Before I open the call to Q&A, I want to take another moment to touch on our recently announced proposed acquisitions of Synergy Health. We are excited about the combination of these businesses and we are working on our Form S-4/Proxy filings which we expect to submit the SEC shortly. While we are still early in conversations we have received positive input from shareholders on both sides of the deal as well as from our customers who are pleased to see two good companies coming together. This is a long-term strategic deal that we’ve been considering and working on for sometime and it’s driven by our desire to create value by expanding our service offers in the U.S. and through accelerated international growth which happens to have some tax advantages. I reiterate that we continue to expect to achieve both the annual pretax cost savings of $30 million or more and to reduce our effective tax rate to approximately 25% of our earnings for the combined businesses. With that, I will turn the call back to Julie to open for Q&A.
Julie Winter: Thank you Wal and Mike for your comments. We are now ready to begin the Q&A session. Jane would you please give the instructions and we will began.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. You may ask you question.
Matthew Ian Mishan – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great, thank you for taking my questions.
Walter M Rosebrough: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Ian Mishan – KeyBanc Capital Markets: You guys are having double-digit growth in healthcare consumables I’m just curious how we should think about growth rate going forward for that growth?
Walter M. Rosebrough:  Matt, as we’ve talked about before we have the consumable business. Most of our consumables are a function of procedure volumes in hospitals for hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers and procedural care units. And so the underlying growth rate is a function of the growth rate of those procedural volumes and we have been seeing that picking up. And then the second piece of the conversion is around either new products or product extensions that we’re bring to that market and clearly we’re seeing that particularly in the US Endoscopy space, what we’ve long-said that we expect double-digit growth in that arena and again in the V-PRO consumable space where we have seen double-digit growths in that arena. So we’re still looking to see kind of that marketplace for procedure growth in the mid single-digits maybe a little stronger these days seems to have picked up some. And then additional for the new products we bring into the marketplace.
Matthew Ian Mishan – KeyBanc Capital Markets: So just a follow-up on that procedural volumes are improving into your back half and you continue to win some new products low double-digit is somewhat sustainable maybe for the next year or two?
Walter M. Rosebrough:  Matt, don’t give product volume forecast that we certainly are not doing forecast next year or two. I think our total forecast in that mid single-digits growth is I think the best place to start and if we see a significant pickup we may see a pickup from that. But I think we’re not changing our long-term view at this point.
Matthew Ian Mishan – KeyBanc Capital Markets: All right and on IMS, I believe you had guidance out there, when you made the acquisition for 10% margins through the course of the year. And it sounded if the cost synergies and maybe some of the revenue growth is coming in a little bit faster. Could you update your expectation and what you think the margins for IMS would be this year?
Walter M. Rosebrough:  Yes, again I don’t think were going to get in detail on the product line but you are correct, the original guidance we gave plus we would be improving those margins over the course of the year and we are ahead of our forecast at this point in time. It’s not huge numbers but its very good sign that we will be at a minimum meeting our original forecast.
Matthew Ian Mishan – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, and then Synergy mentioned in that release that move in forward with another supplier of cobalt. Could you add a little bit of color on that, does anything changed on the minority in front?
Walter M. Rosebrough: First of all Dr. Steve did his normal good job in his conference call and discuss things and I’m just going to leave comments about their business with his comments which are public of course and he did comment that they are pursuing other sources of cobalt. We have not had any significant change in our relationship or orders mainly on at this point in time.
Matthew Ian Mishan – KeyBanc Capital Markets: All right. Thank you very much.
Walter M. Rosebrough: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
David L. Turkaly – JMP Securities LLC: Great, can you hear me?
Walter M. Rosebrough: Certainly, Dave, good morning.
David L. Turkaly – JMP Securities LLC:  Good morning. Related to a question here 1% positive price impact in the quarter, so your Healthcare business, so I was wondering is that across-the-board price related or is there anything you could kind of single out there for that positive price?
Walter M. Rosebrough: I would say generally speaking in this business we look over the long-term, getting inflation minus one is kind of the norm and we got inflation minus one which is kind of the norm and so there is nothing that I would point out one spot versus another.
David L. Turkaly – JMP Securities LLC: Okay, and then I guess quickly to the Life Science side, I guess you mentioned demand is sort of the fact that’s impacting the most, what could change that, do you need a new product cycle there or what would change a year from now that would maybe make that mix go back to positive?
Walter M. Rosebrough: Yes, first of all on Life Science, the mix is very positive right now, because consumables continue to grow and that’s a very attractive business in Life Science, but on the capital side your question is absolutely correct. And as you know the pharmaceutical industry has consolidated and continues to consolidate. When they do that even though they may run more product, they don’t necessarily need more equipment to run that more product. And so I think that’s largely speaking what’s been going on now for several years in the Life Science system. So I think as the pharmaceutical guys finish that convergence if you will, you will see more demand. We are also seeing as is not surprising, we are seeing our service business staying strong because the long you keep old capital the more service it requires. So there is a little bit of a trade-off there between how much service you do and how much capital you buy. And I would clearly seeing that trade, but we do have some products underdevelopment in that space and as we release those we do expect to see increase demand, but I wouldn’t characterize it as anything out of the ordinary if you will, that because it’s more of a market issue. And we have seen on the research side which is the other place where we saw capital in the Life Science business. On the research side we did some – I'll call it some signs of life and we are seeing some signs of life, but its not become any significant pattern and so that market has been down significantly for four, five years now.
David L. Turkaly – JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Keush with Raymond James. You may ask your question.
Lawrence S. Keusch – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just a quick question, I think if we look at the first half reported numbers and the implied numbers for the second half given the guidance it would appear that Isomedix would decelerate in growth from current levels and conversely Life Science would have to increase from current levels to sort of make the overall guidance. So is the best way to think about that is perhaps flip-flopping around where we should think about Isomedix seeing some acceleration and Life Science continue to see some challenges here.
Michael J. Tokich: Yes Larry, this is Mike. I would say in Life Sciences we've already talked about the challenges that we've had and we've been down I think 17% in total for capital equipment. We do not anticipate being down 17% for the full year, we are anticipating that to be mid single-digit decline for the full year, so we are going to get some rebounding on the capital equipment within Life Sciences. So that is one area that again we will see a little bit of reversal and then Isomedix obviously Isomedix is doing very well, they are grown 8% for the year and most of the time the back half of the year is a little bit of a bigger struggle for them just from a comparability standpoint, but obviously we still believe that there is mid single-digit growth in that business.
Lawrence S. Keusch – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, perfect. And then Walt, I guess I just wanted to ask you and come back on two questions regarding the synergy acquisition. I guess the first one is could you talk a little bit about the outsourcing opportunities in the U.S. hospitals segment for sterilization and I guess what makes you think this is obviously native today, but what makes you think that it’s a model of outsourcing these services can get bigger in the U.S. and then I have a follow-up.
Walter M. Rosebrough: You know Larry, I would say a couple of things, as you know we do some outsourcing work already in our IMS business and we are clearly and we've been passing that business along if you will, because often when hospitals are looking to outsourcing, they look to STERIS and we are one of their if not biggest suppliers in that space. Now I am talking about outsourcing of CSDs not outsourcing in general, but when you are looking at central sterile departments. We are one of the biggest players in this space and often one of the biggest suppliers in the space we do a lot of work with them already to help them design their centers when they’re putting them together. And so we’re in a consultant to the mode with them as it is. And they have often asked us to consider taking on some outsourcing. And we basically have been passing that business to IMS for the last five, six, seven maybe longer years and so IMS is in that business. Synergy in my view adds the I’ll call it the final step in the outsourcing that is doing the outsourcing offsite as opposed to the type of consulting we do. And then they do a broad as well. So to me it’s a product extension as well as growth in the outsourcing opportunity. I do think that we are hearing more and more from hospital customers that this is something they are interest in. And something that they would be considering doing and as they group up regionally it also adds some impetus to that thinking. And as we’ve talked before it’s not clear that I mean I don’t believe 100% hospitals will outsource their CSDs. But it doesn’t take very many to be a pretty significant business and that’s what we view the future being.
Lawrence S. Keusch – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay terrific. And then just as an extension to that maybe just help us think about and broad brush strokes to extend that you can the economics for a hospital with having the central sterilization in-house versus outsource.
Walter M Rosebrough: You know that varies widely and again – when getting into the detailed economics I think we probably shouldn’t be going there at this point in time, but when you look at in general what the facilities are looking for when they are considering outsourcing its either one or two things typically. Either they are looking for an improvement in the quality of that process in which case it is not in common for them to spend more to outsource because they are dissatisfied with the level of quality from their process. And so they are either looking for consulting help or management help or even complete outsourcing help to improve the quality of that service or they are looking for a reduction in the cost in that service. Obviously the Nirvana is when both can be done but my experience is it’s commonly one of the others more the driver. And so that – what their needs are really determine kind of the economic situation with the individual facilities.
Lawrence S. Keusch – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, and then lastly I think Mike in the first quarter call, you provided the acquisition impact on EBIT margins and unless I missed it could you provide that for this quarter?
Julie Winter: We did last quarter Larry, you’re right. This is Julie. Last quarter, it was a bit of drain, this quarter was actually neutral.
Lawrence S. Keusch – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Walter M Rosebrough: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Erin Wilson – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking for my questions. The healthcare capital equipment strength that was encouraging where there any large one-time orders that drove it or was it relatively broad based. Are you seeing that trend continue in the current quarter? And how would you characterize purchasing behavior of your customers, is it higher end equipment compared to more standard equipment, any sort of color that would be helpful. Thanks.
Walter M Rosebrough: Sure. Good morning Erin. A couple of comments I guess you have kind of track back to the first part of this calendar year which is our Q4. And we clearly saw and we have talked about this. We clearly saw on the first couple of months of that calendar year hesitancy to release capital equipment. So most hospitals in our experience were forecasting that they would spend telling their people they would spend putting in their budget that they would spend about the same or maybe point or two more than they did the previous year. But many, many of them had that spending on hold to see how the whole they see anything was going to workout in first several months of the year. Probably we started seeing mid February-ish timeframe then releasing those capital spending holds. And really since then, I would say it’s been for a lack of better terms business as usual. And we have been saying that pretty much for two or three years now. It’s not some big spike in capital spending at least from our perspective nor is it a dearth of capital spending. We did have a little bit of pause in that January first half of February timeframe in terms of people placing orders, they also – they were going to if their bosses let them. But they were on hold. And pretty much that released over the last several months. And so the business has been I would characterize it as solid. I haven’t yet seen data on this from broad-based data. But we do see a lot of customers in our visitation programs and in other things we do with customers. And I would say generally the last couple of months, people have been in our view more optimistic about their volumes, whether they are full or not, both outpatient and inpatient but particularly their residual volumes. And that tracks well with what we’re see in Isomedix, right. We are seeing volumes in Isomedix which is medical devices which means somebody is doing something. And then – and it also tracks with what our consumables are showing. So it seems to us that volumes are up, there is always a lag time between volumes up and capital spending, but they do tend to be correlated over the long period. So we are a bit more optimistic I that our original feelings refracted I don’t think we see this as a surge in capital equipment, but we’ve had cautious optimism and we continue to maintain that. I don’t think there is any huge mix variation, hospital customers are not moving upscale or moving downscale in any broad way that I see. So I think that’s pretty much normal.
Erin Wilson – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great, thanks. And can you speak to the reprocessing market your potential to expand into this market and what sort of opportunity or changes you are seeing in that space, could this be a meaningful opportunity for you in the U.S. and abroad?
Walter M Rosebrough: Erin, I need to be clear on what you mean by reprocessing, because there are – I’ll characterize it is two broad based kinds of reprocessing. The first is devices that are clear to be single-use devices that been our reprocessed – that a I would call it surge or single-use device reprocessor does to turn that device into potentially a multiple use device. So you do whatever work is required, they go and get a 510(k) in order to do that, so it’s a regulated business and they do that reprocessing. I suspect you are talking about the synergy business where they have taken, they’ve outsourced the work for SterilMed a division of J&J. And to the extent J&J sees that as a good opportunity which they seem to. And it is clear that synergy is doing that work for them on a contract basis and they see there is an opportunity and they’ve been clear that they do, they see that it’s a growth opportunity and we would concur. But in terms of us being in being the single-use reprocessor the entity that goes out and gets the 510(k)’s and works with the FDA and works with the OEMs. We think the guys doing that who are typically OEMs now, most of the people in that are historic OEMs and we think they are well suited to do that and we don’t see any reason to head there in that space, but if we can do work for them either some physical work and/or some cleaning and disinfecting and sterilization, it’s obviously something that fits our strength, so that’s how we characterize the I'll call it SUDs market or single-use disposable reprocessing market. The counter to day is the surgical – what we do in IMS now which is the surgical equipment device if you will surgical instrument and scope reprocessing where you are taking your device, its suppose to be a multiple use device, its was clear to be a multi – it is a multiuse device. And we are doing what needs to be done to keep it in good shape and that is something we are very interest in, we think we have very good capabilities with the combination of the five businesses we've purchased, we think we have very good technical skill and so we do see that as a real opportunity for growth for us in that arena, certainly in the U.S. in the longer term probably overseas.
Erin Wilson – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks so much and should we still expect a filing in the next couple of weeks as it relates to the Synergy Health acquisition?
Michael J. Tokich: All this technical detail its hard to know the exact time, but we are still thinking days and weeks, not weeks and months.
Erin Wilson – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great, thanks so much.
Michael J. Tokich: You bet, Ann.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lake Review. Your line is open.
Jason A. Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: Good morning.
Julie Winter: Good morning Jason.
Jason A. Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: Looking at the company now, it will have a larger percentage of revenue derived overseas with the Synergy acquisition. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing as far as the level of spending for the hospitals overseas as well as potential synergies from the combined company STERIS and as far as the synergies you are seeing overseas, you mentioned some domestically, but just looking for overseas revenue Synergy potential as well.
Walter M. Rosebrough: Sure. I'll break that into two questions if you will and we are clearly – Synergy Health as appose to synergies, Synergy Health is clearly much more non-U.S. based and that was one of the real advantages we saw in the combination is it increases our footprint outside the U.S., we've talked many times we've grown our OUS business organically faster than our U.S. business, just what happens the acquisitions we made tended to be more U.S. so we are pleased, we've been looking for things OUS on the acquisition front and had been working on those for some time and we are pleased to be able to be able to do that with Synergy. So we clearly see that as one of the significant advantages is having a broader OUS footprint and particularly in the AST business or what we would call Isomedix business. In their AST business they have work to get into the faster growing markets as well, not just in Europe, they are very strong in Europe, but they’ve moved into the for lack of better term emerging markets and we see that as a really opportunity. So full stop that was one of the significant reasons for the deal.  Secondarily, we do expect to see many of those markets in the emerging markets if you will grow faster than the U.S., or European business. And as a result, we see that as an opportunity, we also see opportunities where they have strength with customers to help us do a better job selling things outside the U.S. or they have good strength with customers and we would expect to help them in the U.S. where we have good strength of customers. So the cross revenue synergy, well I think is what you are describing there is something we think will happen. Those are almost always longer term affairs that doesn’t usually happen time zero and so that’s why I talk about this as a strategic long-term acquisition because of the revenue synergies almost always take longer to accrue and particularly when you are talking about cross national revenue synergies as opposed to in the same general geography. So we do expect that to take longer. The other – the cost synergies we’ve been clear and that is filed and in short we’ve committed that we expect that to be $30 million or more and we continue to expect that.
Jason A. Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: And just some commentary on the level of hospital spending in those markets overseas?
Walter M. Rosebrough:  Yes, we’ve seen I guess it’s interesting, our business is actually been stronger in Europe this year than in the previous years and I think that’s a little counter trend. I think we’ve see more weakness there. We’ve been stronger than the market I think in Europe in the last few months or at least relative to our previous year. I do think particularly in the Eastern Europe we’ve seen some softening across the board Life Science and Healthcare. So that’s kind of the broadest way to say and I would not – I would – it seems to us that the European markets are backing off a little bit vis-à-vis the U.S. market in terms of market demand. The other piece of that is when you put the Japanese – the Japan, the Asian markets and the Latin America markets we’ve seen a slip and we’ve talked about that in the first quarter. Our Latin American markets have softened a bit relative to our history and our Asian markets have grown a bit, so they pretty much offset each other in total growing, but the Asian markets offsetting the Latin America. And then as most people know the –we put our, when we talk about Europe, we talk EMEA which includes the Middle East markets and the Middle East markets are strong.
Jason A. Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: And then looking at Europe, do most hospitals outsource their sterilization needs or is there a still a large opportunity within the hospitals?
Walter M. Rosebrough:  It is mixed and it depends on the country, the UK is really where this phenomena got legs. There’s been outsourcing in the U.S., there’s been outsourcing in different parts of Europe, but where really got legs in grew was in the UK and synergy is really one of the driving forces, one of the reasons that occurred in my opinion. And so there is opportunity, but generally speaking I think we’ve seen more activity in the southern countries in Europe then we have in the other Northern countries in Europe as a general statement. But if you look at in terms of the amount that’s placed that’s definitely the case, so but there is potential upside in that over the longer-term.
Jason A. Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: Thank you.
Walter M. Rosebrough: You bet.
Operator: Our final question comes from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Your line is open.
Mitra Ramgopal – Sidoti & Company, LLC: Yes, hi good morning. Just a couple of questions, coming back to the IMS acquisition, it looks like from a revenue standpoint it’s running well ahead of where the business was when you bought it. I was just wondering if it’s really the strength of the underlying business or are you already able to start levering that the top line.
Walter M. Rosebrough: Yes.
Mitra Ramgopal – Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay.
Walter M. Rosebrough: IMS had a nice business and they were planning to grow double-digits and I think they would have grown those kinds of numbers on their own. And we have clearly seen an ability to as I commented earlier the cost synergies are coming at least as quickly as we expected and really probably more quickly than we expected and we are seeing signs of revenue synergies that are more favorable than we expected.
Mitra Ramgopal – Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, thanks and also just in terms of use of cash I know you’ve always generated tremendous free cash flow in the past and have allocated it in terms of share buybacks increasing the dividend et cetera. But given the recent acquisitions and increased leverage on the balance sheet is the use now going to be towards maybe reducing debt asset acquisitions or you still looking to occasionally repurchase shares and also increased the dividend.
Walter M. Rosebrough: Yes, again we’ve been I think consistent for 6.5 or 7-years on our allocation of cash and that allocation is in rank order we don’t expect to cut our dividends, and we generally expect to grow them. Secondly, we’ll invest in the organic growth of the businesses we already have. Thirdly, we’ll look for acquisition opportunity in adjacent markets, and fourthly look at doing share buybacks if the first three opportunities don’t use the full cash that we have on hand and need to have for future of the first three. The one thing we did change when we announced this acquisition is because our leverage ratio is running up will be we think around 2.8, 2.9 leverage ratio. We do see reduction of that leverage as a lever that’s a head of share buybacks in general. So we would expect to be deleveraging before we did any buybacks, but I would still put the first three in the appropriate order. And you have to look that in the long-term, on long-term basis.
Mitra Ramgopal – Sidoti & Company, LLC: Absolutely. Thanks again for taking the questions.
Walter M Rosebrough: You bet.
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I will turn the call back for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: This concludes the second quarter conference call. Thanks everybody for joining us and your interest in STERIS.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our first quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Walt will provide his commentary on our performance. Let me now begin with a review of our first quarter income statement. Total revenue grew 12% during the first quarter driven by a 3% increase in organic volume and a 9% increase from acquisitions pricing and foreign currency were both above neutral to revenue during the quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter increased to 160 basis points to 41.5%, gross margin was positively impacted by favorable product mix and foreign currency somewhat offset by higher material costs and inflation. EBIT margin expand 110 basis points to 13.6% of revenue. The improvement in EBIT margin was driven by higher organic volumes and improved gross margins offset by lower EBIT margin attainment from our recent acquisitions which was anticipated and negatively impacted EBIT margins by 50 basis points. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.8% compared with 36.7% last year. During the quarter, we did have unfavorable discreet items, impact our effective tax rate. We anticipate a full year effective tax rate of approximately 35% which includes the assumed renewal of the tax extenders which have not been reflected in our Q1 results. Even with the higher tax rate, net income increased 23% to $32 million or $0.54 per diluted share compared with $26.2 million or $0.44 per diluted share last year. Moving on to our segment results, Healthcare had a very good quarter, growing revenue 17% in total of which 4% was organic growth. Healthcare service revenue grew 43%, driven by acquisitions and strong organic growth, consumable revenue increased 12% while capital equipment revenue grew 1%. Healthcare backlog at the end of the quarter was up 4% from the prior year levels to $125 million, an increase of 13% sequentially. Healthcare operating margins increased 220 basis points to 9.8% of revenue. The increase in operating income year-over-year was driven by volume, product mix and productivity somewhat offset by higher material costs. Life Sciences’ revenue declined 2% during the quarter, strong performance in both consumable revenue, which grew 6% and service revenue which grew 9% were more than offset by an 18% decline in capital equipment revenue. As you already know, capital equipment tends to vary quarter by quarter within this segment. Backlog in Life Sciences end of the quarter at $46 million, an increase of 3% compared with the prior year. Life Science’s fourth quarter operating margin of 20.4% of revenue is down slightly from the prior year reflecting the decline in revenue. Revenue for Isomedix increased 6% in the quarter to $51.2 million, expanded capacity contributed to revenue growth within the segment as well as increased demand from our core medical device customers. Isomedix operating margin was 31.7% of revenue an increase of 50 basis points as compared to the prior year. In terms of STERIS’ consolidated balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a $157.9 million of cash and $658.7 million in long term debt. Our debt to EBITDA ratio now stands at approximately 2.2 times well within our covenant maximum of 3.25 times providing us liquidity to invest in the business. Our day sales outstanding improved by two days to 62 days at the end of the quarter. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $23.1 million, an increase of $12.1 million as compared with the prior year. Capital spending was $23.3 million in the quarter, while depreciation amortization was $20.4 million. With that I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt?
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter call. Mike has covered the financials, so I will focus on a few qualitative highlights from the quarter. We are pleased to start a new fiscal year with strong results that are in line with both our expectations (inaudible). As you would expect in the first quarter of our fiscal year, sequential organic growth has slowed somewhat but we are still delivering solid revenue growth along with the results of our recent acquisitions. Our healthcare segment had strength in both consumable and service revenue and flat capital equipment sales. In the consumable franchise we had growth across the board and in particular instrument cleaning chemistry such as Prolystica, (inaudible) high level disinfection chemistry for GI departments. The new necessary products in our U.S. endoscopy business and the consumable and sterility assurance products that are related to our growing installed base of V-PRO hydrogen peroxide sterilizers. On that note, we have received FDA clearance for use of our V-PRO verified biological indicator with most of J&J Sterrad hydrogen peroxide sterilizers during the quarter. We continue to be optimistic about the success of our V-PRO equipment and the related consumables. Our service business in healthcare is also growing. In part, from the IMS acquisition that closed in May. Revenue from IMS accounted for about two-thirds of our healthcare service revenue growth in the quarter but our organic growth was nice as well. Our integration plans are well underway for IMS and we are successfully integrating our specialty service businesses. As you know, we are expecting both revenue and cost synergies in this business and we are seeing indications of both. Beyond the IMS acquisition, we saw strong specialty service organic growth as well as an increase in insulations from the high level of capital equipment shipped in the fourth quarter. In healthcare capital equipment, our shipments were bit softer that we anticipated in the quarter as organic revenue was down slightly. However, with the very strong shipments we experienced last quarter and our backlog showing growth both sequentially and year-over-year, we believe this to be timing. We continue feel that the hospital of capital spending remain stable as we have said for several quarters and that our shipments will pick up over the course of the fiscal year. On the Life Science side of our business, we had another strong revenue quarter for both consumables and service which has helped us maintain our operating margins, offsetting net growth our capital equipment shipments were lower than we had anticipated. As you know, capital shipments in Life Science are particularly lumpy, this the consecutive quarter without year-over-year growth. In particular, we have seen some softness in the former side of the business where there are economic issues impacting growth for the industry, especially in Eastern Europe. However, we have seen orders picking up for the past several weeks and our backlog is back to historic levels. As a result, we expect sequential improvements in the business. For the year, we anticipate that shipments will improve but overall capital equipment will remain under pressure causing total Life Science revenue growth to be headed somewhat. We expect the strength in service and consumables to offset any weakness in capital from margin prospective. Isomedix revenue continues its growth pattern posting 6% revenue growth in the quarter. This reflects filling in capacity we have added in the past couple of years due in large part to continued demand from our core medical device customers. As you already know, we are planning to add additional capacity in this segment as volume has somewhat outstripped our long term expectations. From a total company prospective, we did a good job of maintaining gross margin sequentially holding steady at our yearend level despite substantially less volumes. As we anticipated the impact to the IMS acquisition is somewhat dilutive to operating margins in the quarter although in total we did see nice year-over-year improvement. We have work to do to get to our full year anticipated 15% margin rate which is just as we planned at the beginning of the year. Our first quarter is on our plan to meet that target and we believe we are well positioned to continue to do so for the balance of the year. And of course we are very pleased that our people produced adjusted earnings per share at $0.54 for the quarter, an increase of 23% over prior year. This is a great start to our year and we have increased confidence in our ability to meet our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.78 to $2.91. With that I will turn the call over to Julie to begin the Q&A portion of our call.
Julie Winter: Thank you Wal and Mike for your comments. We are now ready to begin the Q&A session, so Jane would you please give the instructions and we will get started.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Just for the modeling purposes to start, what was the healthcare capital equipment year-over-year minus Eschmann?
Walt Rosebrough: The organic healthcare capital equipment was down about 6% Matt, that excludes Eschmann.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc: Eschmann is the only adjustment.
Walt Rosebrough: Right, it’s the only adjustment.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc: And if I remember correctly I think the backlog you reported for that business at the end of the last quarter was up 5%, can you kind of walk through little bit of delta between the backlog that you reported at the end of the last quarter and may be the overall result in the quarter?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, you are correct. The backlog was up in the fourth quarter, 5% year-over-year and we ended the first quarter up 4%, it’s about $15 million in total backlog increase.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc: No, I was talking about, I am sorry if I wasn’t clear, I was talking about the 6% decline in capital equipment sales in the quarter versus the backlog actually ending up at the end of the previous quarter up of 5%? Whether there is some timing differences or some orders delayed, just a little bit of color on that?
Walt Rosebrough: I would not say that there were significant timing delays or it is we got to sit down and do the actual math, it’s like an inventory problem, so exact same math but backlog is up for the quarter and shipments were down a bit for the quarter but again mathematically it’s just a matter of filling in time those data but there was no significant what I would call, any significant change in order pattern or any significant change in delays and shipment for the quarter. We were just off a bit versus prior year and slightly behind our expectations and that’s not unusual, several million dollars can move either way pretty easily. So nothing that I would call significant which is why we think there are capital forecast for the year is still steady.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc: Okay. And then on healthcare side, you were the lead manufacturing and in sourcing initiatives were those net costs in the quarter or net savings?
Walter Rosebrough: I will have to get on the detailed map but I think on net it's about a wash, if you compare it to last year though, that's the savings.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc: Okay. And just lastly on Isomedix, was there any downtime or extra cost associated with the FDA warning and can you give the update on how that’s progressing?
Michael Tokich: We have continued to do routine reporting with the agency to correct any deficiencies that they view have occurred or are occurring and there are increased costs which we have put into both our plan and then to our actual. So we do anticipate spending significantly more in the quality side of that business but in terms of – that we did occur some of that cost in the quarter and we did – and we indeed anticipate incurring more but those are bills cost are assumed or put into our plan and are offset by increased deficiencies due to the growth in the business and utilizing the capacity. So the numbers you see include those costs.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc: Right. Thank you very much.
Walter Rosebrough: And in terms of disruptions, there was no disruption in the quarter. We actually did have a couple of cobalt loadings which does cause a little lessening of revenue but it is typical for us to have cobalt because we have a number of plants. It's just we had a little more than normal in this most recent quarter.
Michael Tokich: And Matt just to give some context we are talking about single digit millions here of that cost increases.
Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Turkaly with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Dave Turkaly - JMP Securities: Thanks. I am sorry I missed it very end of that last question but the material cost that you have added in your commentary color there and then I think you mentioned inflation as well. Any other specifics that you can point to?
Walter Rosebrough: Those are the two major drivers that we have seen both materials some of that being chemicals and then on the inflation just normal inflation as, it’s probably couple of percent, it's just general inflation raises kick in and the like year-over-year.
Michael Tokich: Yes, I wouldn't characterize anything radically normal inflation as you know oil has picked up a bit in the last quarter. So anything that's oil related may have a little pick up and then we are seeing some commodities picking up a little bit but again it's not anything that's a ramping inflation.
Dave Turkaly - JMP Securities: Great and then IMS closing, I know the operating margin is somewhere around 10 and I think you guys thought you get up to 15, Frank, how quickly do you think that can occur?
Walter Rosebrough: All of the improvements in the IMS integration will not fully be materialized for a body team once I would say that when we look at integration plan that's roughly the timing of the completion, full completion integration as is often the case, some of those occur relatively quickly which they are just as we would plan. Some of them take longer and that's indeed what's going on. This is generally not an integration where we were looking at for example having two factories, you pull one factory and you only have one. This is largely we expect to see the results of the cost side of the integration. We expect to see the bulk of that occurring as we grow into our service force. So because it's geographically related about half the business is heavily geographically related, as we add more sort of this into geography on a percentage basis, we have to add less people. And so largely we are expecting this to be revenue growth kind of growing into our own skin if you will the various organizations. There is a piece, however, that we are seeing quicker which we anticipated seeing quicker which is we both, now there were five or six businesses here and all of them outsourced some portion of the business, some of them tended to be stronger scope prepare, some of them tended to be stronger and instrument repair and they were in many cases, outsourcing a portion of the work in the area they tended to be less strong. And now we are outsourcing to each other. So we have captured, we are capturing and will continue to capture more of that margin where as opposed to outsourcing to a third party, we are outsourcing if you will to ourselves or we are insourcing to ourselves that piece we are picking up more rapidly. The other piece will take more time.
Dave Turkaly - JMP Securities: And if we look at that, if some of the businesses run around the 15 rate, I mean is that the limit where they can go or do you think now that given that you have more scale that sort of you look at those deals together and think that hey, we can get there operating margin there, I don't maybe into the 17%, 16% range from sort of that 15 base?
Michael Tokich: We appreciate the confidence. We like to walk before we run 10 to 15, we think it's pretty good approach and we will work on the balance after that. And as a general statement as you know I like businesses to be over 15. I started to get little handsy in this kind of space I get handsy where they get upwards to 20 or over 20 but we do not see a constraint on that objective. We will walk before we run.
Dave Turkaly - JMP Securities: Last one, thank you and Isomedix, you mentioned capacity are you at full now in terms of where you stand versus what you built out?
Walter Rosebrough: The answer is no. It is geographically differential if you will. We have certain plans, sort of pretty close to capacity. We have certain plans that have ways to go. Some of that is because of recent capacity adds and so you can't make a general characterization is all of Isomedix will add capacity but we do have room to grow in certain of our facilities, we have facilities that are fairly full. And part of what we do is we work with our customers to the extend we can if we have a less full plan and we can move some of their businesses to one of those, we do that as long as geographically appropriate. But in general, we are fuller than we were let's say two years ago or so. And we are approaching capacity and certain of those factories but that's why we are adding capacity in the near future. So we generally would not want to ever get to where we are running full capacity because then we have no room for growth. We try to put the capacity in place ahead of the growth.
Dave Turkaly - JMP Securities: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens. Your line is open.
Chris Cooley - Stephens: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?
Walter Rosebrough: Very well Chris. Thank you.
Chris Cooley – Stephens: Super. Hey I just want to drill down on a couple of items if I may. I know you don't like to give single product guidance but when you look at the healthcare capital orders that you were able to realize during the course of the quarter and then what comprises the backlog? Could you kind of characterize maybe just broadly where you are seeing maybe stronger demand or demand is more in line with the expectations from the capital perspective and then similarly, what do you think is taking place that's allowing your orders to pick backup on the Life Science side. I realized again that business is historically very lumpy. But three quarters in a row down what gives you some confidence that turns in the coming quarters? Thanks so much and I have got one follow up if I could after that.
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. I am going to break those into two questions Chris. On the first, in the healthcare side, I wouldn't characterize any significant change in mix in healthcare one versus the other in terms of products. Now we do have, as you might expect sometimes we have new products coming and what we do our people might slow down a little bit on the sale of the older one our customers may slow down on the purchase of the older one waiting for newer one and we are always releasing products in kind of all of our families. So there maybe some minor variations going on there but as a general statement I would say relatively speaking the IPT segment has been strong, part of that is driven by the particular strength in hydrogen peroxide sterilization, so V-PRO has been quite strong. So there maybe a little tip that way for that purposes. Our washers had been very strong. They have kind of softened a little bit and our sterilizers have picked up but I would not characterize anything that's kind of is overwhelming strength or weakness and things do have been flow a little bit across the product lines. Now this is a little bit or memory reach but we were very strong in surgical a couple of quarters ago. I remember it and we have kind of gone back to the mean and that's the way things tend to run. So again there is nothing that I would say mix-wise, I think the product that I would point out. We have seen mix in geography. North America has stayed very solid for quite some time now as we have said. We have seen kind of a back and forth across the ocean that is our European business has picked up nicely, MEA has picked up nicely for now a fairly long time, six to nine months, so I would say that they have been strengthening and whereas year or two ago, they were showing weakness. We have seen the Asia-Pacific market and the Latin American market trade places and that's not particularly unusual that there are smaller businesses, so we do give more variation there. Last year we were talking about great Latin America was and how weak Asia-Pacific was. Right now we would say Asia-Pacific is stronger and Latin America is weaker but those are relative statements and nothing that I would consider out of the ordinary. So in healthcare, yes there is some movement around but it's what I would call normal movement. On the Life Science side, we have clearly seen the pharma guys the last year so backing off a bit and particularly Eastern Europe and there is a lot going on these Eastern Europe these days and there is we are seeing some more consolidation in that space. So we have seen some reduction there. And the good news is we have actually seen the research market starting to pick up a little bit and research has been non-existed, I am over stating a little bit for fact but research has been very dead for a long time. We are talking not months but years. And that seems to be actually picking up a little bit. So we are feeling better about that. And then on the pharma side, because these orders are longer term in nature, we do have visibility that and we just have seen a number of orders coming in recently on the pharma side and we are seeing some more pipeline. Lastly, we have some new products in that area that are coming which we are confident. So if you put that all together, that's what creates our view of the future on the Life Science capital side. Although we do think it is still under pressure. It's not where we would say the healthcare space is. But again the converse is the consumable service side has been quite strong. It's not unusual that people don't buy new stuff, they have to service the old stuff. So there is some increase in that as a result of that my view but that would be I think pretty decent summary Chris.
Chris Cooley – Stephens: Okay. That's great. I really appreciate the color. And if I could just squeeze one more kind of big picture question in, you guys are doing great job on the leverage story here clearly have additional capacity from a credit perspective. Help us and you have increased – sort of in the morning of course to penny for the quarter now. So help us just think a little bit about capital allocation and in particular you have done – you have clearly rolled up the service business on the healthcare capital side of the opportunities to grow abroad and maybe not so much from an inversion standpoint but just to maybe offset or hedge domestic growth just kind of help us think about how you are thinking about the capital structure in the forward growth outlook as a result of maybe using capital or not using capital. Thanks so much.
Michael Tokich: Sure Chris. I would say we have not changed our view of how we allocate capital that is we do. We protect the dividend and we intend to grow the dividend. We intend to, provide funding for the businesses we are already in to grow and defend and grow those businesses. Thirdly we look for acquisition and in looking for acquisitions we look at two factors. The first is that it return the cost of capital that we are comfortable with and the second is that we compare to buying back our own stock and so we look at both those factors we are making those decisions and then lastly if we have not exhausted our capacity we look at purchasing back our own stock and as you guys know I guess the modest shift is four, five years ago, we had less opportunity on the acquisition side and more opportunity on the buy back stock side. So we did that. The last year, year and half, we have seen more opportunity on the acquiring businesses that fit our business and less as a result less on the stock buyback that we will make those decisions exactly the same way and you never know what you can and can't get done on the acquisition side but we do have a robust pipeline, we still think we have opportunities that there. In terms of the international versus U.S. we have grown interestingly enough, our ratio of revenue in U.S. versus O.U.S. has been roughly constant the last five or six years as because the organic growth O.U.S. has been faster than inside the U.S. and we have done more acquisition inside the U.S. We have done some deals outside the U.S. Eschmann is the most recent another one but we would but certainly consider acquisitions outside the U.S. we do have those in our pipeline as well as those inside the U.S. We don't radically favor one versus the other. If you look at what's the total market and what's the business and how does it fit and the strategic fit to us is the number one criteria.
Chris Cooley – Stephens: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Erin Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks so much for taking my question. And Ed this just follow-up with the last question but I saw I guess a news yesterday about a partnership with an Italian sterilization company and I know my Italian is not very good but if you can provide some greater detail on that or is that a new opportunity an update on the existing relationship. And what's incorporated into your guidance as it relates to this opportunity and I guess broadly speaking, what you consider your near and long term opportunities overseas?
Michael Tokich: Sure the company you are discussing with Service Italia. It's a relatively small it's small investment for us. You are correct it is a as a combination of the two things it is a historic relationship that Service Italia has purchased services and goods from us for a number of years. So we have dealt with them for a very long term. And they have been a good customer of our. So we are doing two things simultaneously, the first is we are clearly expanding that customer relationship so they are going to be purchasing more of our equipment and services and then secondly we will be potentially entertaining doing some joint venture type of work with them as it relates to hospital outsourced sterilization of reusable surgical equipment. And so we are looking, it’s an exploratory issue at this point in time. We do expect to do some business I don't think you will not see material change in the next 12 to 24 months as a result of this which is why we didn’t make an announcement it's not material for our earnings rate or holdings. It is material for them which is why they didn’t make an announcement but it's an interesting opportunity for us. We will be again gaining some business and we are also be find and learn understand more about that side of the business.
Erin Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And can you provide or I guess you already provided some color on this already but what's embedded to into your guidance for at all this speaking as it relates to underlying utilization trends or procedure volumes at this point?
Michael Tokich: We if you look kind of generally speaking, we are still seeing what we think are single-digit kind of underlying growth rate if you will pretty much across the board for our as long time we are talking about North America now, pretty much across the board in all of our lines. So that's kind of our expectation and so far in terms of what we are seeing in terms of share value amount not revenue necessarily because revenues change but we think we are still seeing orders of magnitude that level of volume.
Erin Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Larry Keusch - Raymond James: Hi good morning. Walt, so for the 15% target for operating margin for the year, obviously you start of the first quarter very nicely at 13.6% but certainly that implies some acceleration through the year and so I am just curious about sort of how we should think about that getting IFC understand the fourth quarter should be the largest of the year given the historic seasonality but it also implies that we probably need to move up to 15% in the next couple quarters and so I would like to sort of do get sense to that and then remind us there are lot of factors this year that that impact that margin about what really drives it from the levels where we are now towards that 15% for the year?
Walter Rosebrough: Sure and I will step back and say from beginning, we don't provide quarterly guidance. And so I am not going to do so. Here in the annual when we laid our plan out at the beginning of the year, we did say that our best expectation was it would be similar to or mirror our last year's timing and so we don't have a difference of views on that today. That first quarter came in pretty much as we expected and we kind of expect similar things going forward. So we don't have a change of view at all there. In terms – and it is mathematically correct, you can't start below the average and get to the average unless you get the average, unless you get above it. So that's true but if you were back and looked at our previous years, you would see that there – that we have had a ramping during the course of the year and then actually we moved up year-over-year too. So in both ways to look at it we are on a north bound express way and so we intend to continue that. Part of the issue is purely volume that is the back half of the year is stronger than the first half of the year, when that happens, our fix cost don't rise and so there is a bit of timing question and we don't amortizes our plans and equipments and all that on a per use basis it's on a per day basis. So that creates a part of it. The second part we have talked about is we bring IMS in and integrate with those other businesses we expect to see margin expansion there and then the third significant piece is we have continued down on our insourcing path and we fully expect to see significant reductions in our cost as result of that insourcing and that we see more into the year to the beginning. All three of those areas we think that we are on the pathway that we are literally on our plan, we are on the pathway to get where we expected to go. So we fully expect to achieve those. But those are probably the biggest issues that we need to – those are biggest issues we need to in order to meet the plans we have in place.
Larry Keusch - Raymond James: Okay. That’s great and Walt just a couple of other quick ones but along that line with that explanation, you did indicate in your prepared remarks that you felt more confident today in the ability to hit the yearend numbers of those three sort of factors that you mentioned, volume, IMS, insourcing et cetera, are you more confident in all those that makes you say that or is there something that you see today that is more specific to one of those that can give you that greater confidence and then I have one other question.
Walter Rosebrough: Yes I would say the answer in general is yes that is since all three of them are kind of headed down a year – a plan and year as pathway and if I were off any of those three, I would be less confident the fact that I am on the three makes me more confident. So it's true pretty much for us to board but in terms of I suspect in terms of any one item when we bought IMS we bought our IMS now we have been running IMS for while that's coming out looking like we thought it would and that's always a little bit of a pig in a poke, any acquisition no matter how much you think no matter how much you do due-diligence, there is something in the book, bit to it and we are finding that what we purchased is what we expected the purchase and the early on indications both on the revenue side, the customer acceptance side, and on the cost side we have not seen anything that detours us from our original thinking and that's always a comforting fact even if it's only couple of months.
Larry Keusch - Raymond James: Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly on I think I heard the contribution from Eschmann in the quarter but I was wondering if you could also help us understand the contribution from IMS particularly since you closed it intra-quarter.
Michael Tokich: Yes from a revenue standpoint, there were about two thirds of our total service improvements. Service grew 43% total sales so they were two-thirds of that on the revenue side. And then basically by the time they got to the bottom line they were in roughly they were as expected 10% margin area which we anticipated would occur.
Larry Keusch - Raymond James: Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.
Jason Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: Good morning. How would you characterize the new product pipeline in healthcare currently versus how it was the same time last year?
Michael Tokich: I wouldn't characterize it any different at all. We had a number of products that we were bringing to market and we have more so I wouldn't characterize it any different at all.
Jason Rodgers - Great Lakes Review: That was it. Thank you.
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I will turn the call back for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: This concludes the conference call. Thanks everybody for joining us and your interest in STERIS and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

 With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure again to be with you this morning to review our fourth quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Walt will provide his commentary on the year, including an overview of our strategic initiatives along with our outlook for fiscal 2015.
 As Julie already stated, our comments this morning will focus on adjusted results. Please see the reconciliation table included in our press release for additional details.
 Let me now begin with a review of our fourth quarter income statement. Total revenue grew 9% during the fourth quarter, driven by a 7% increase in organic volume, a 1.6% increase from acquisitions and a 30 basis point improvement in pricing. Foreign currency was neutral to revenue during the quarter.
 Gross margin dollars increased 10% in the quarter due mainly to the increase in revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter increased 30 basis points to 41.5%. We had positive impact from volume and price. This was somewhat offset by the continued organic expansion of our Spectrum instrument repair business into new territories throughout the United States, which takes time to bring to full margin.
 The in-sourcing projects we have been discussing with you this year were neutral to gross margin in the quarter, as expected. The significant increase in volume improved EBIT meaningfully as a result of operating expense leverage to $86.5 million in the quarter. Our EBIT margin at 18.6% of revenue increased both sequentially and year-over-year during the quarter.
 The effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.8% compared with 30.3% last year. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of last year was lower, primarily as a result of discrete item adjustments, including the settlement of prior year tax audits and the recording of the federal R&D tax credit. Even with a higher tax rate, net income increased 30% to $54.2 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared with $41.5 million or $0.70 per diluted share last year.
 Moving on to our segment results. Healthcare had a very good quarter, growing revenue 12% in total. Included in that growth are several smaller acquisitions that we made during the quarter, which Walt will cover in his remarks. Healthcare capital equipment revenue grew 13%, consumable revenue increased 5% and service revenue grew 16%. 
 Even with the strong shipments of capital equipment in the quarter, Healthcare backlog was still up 5% from the prior year levels to $110 million. Healthcare operating margins increased 410 basis points to 17.7% of revenue. The increase in operating income year-over-year was primarily driven by the increase in volume, as well as operating expense leverage.
 Life Sciences revenue declined 1% during the quarter. Strong performance in consumable revenue, which grew 9%, was more than offset by a 7% decline in service revenue and a 5% decline in capital equipment revenue. The decline in service revenue is primarily due to tough comparisons with a very strong fourth quarter last year.
 Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $44.4 million, a decline of 8% but remains at a level consistent with historic backlog levels. Life Sciences fourth quarter operating margin at 18.9% of revenue declined slightly on the lower volume.
 Revenue for Isomedix increased 8% in the quarter to $49.4 million. Expanded capacity contributed to revenue growth within this segment, as well as increased demand from our core medical device customers. 
 Isomedix operating margin at 28.7% of revenue, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the prior year. Remember, this business has significant fixed costs, so additional volumes benefit margins substantially.
 In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $152.8 million of cash and $493.5 million in long-term debt.
 We anticipate funding the IMS acquisition with borrowings under our credit facility. Immediately following the close of the acquisition, we anticipate an increase in our debt-to-capital ratio from 32% to approximately 39% and an increase in our debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 1.6x to approximately 2.2x, well within our coveted maximum of 3.25x. The current interest rate on our credit facility is approximately 1.5%.
 Due to the timing of shipments in the quarter, our accounts receivable balance was $313.7 million, which has slightly impacted our DSO. Our DSO is currently at 71 days. We do, however, expect to get back to normal levels within the next quarter.
 Our free cash flow for fiscal 2014 was $128 million compared with $140.4 million in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow, which was anticipated, is primarily due to payments of our annual incentive compensation program, which did not occur in the prior year, as well as the impact of strong working capital improvements in the prior year. Capital spending was $21.6 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $20 million.
 With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter Rosebrough: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to finish the year so strong and with another year of record earnings. We have made great strides toward our strategic objectives over the past couple of years and are excited about the direction we are heading. Our company has been reinvigorated by the investments we are making to grow organically and through acquisition, which enable us to provide even more value to our customers, our people and our shareholders.
 Our 10% top line growth for the year was primarily driven by North America for all 3 business segments, as well as nice growth in our EMEA business in Healthcare. We expanded operating margins by 50 basis points, despite the medical device excise tax and while investing in R&D and in-sourcing. Full year adjusted earnings per share were a record $2.48.
 Turning to the individual segments for a moment. Our Healthcare people grew revenue 12% for the year, with strength in the United States and in EMEA. In particular, capital equipment product families, including V-PRO sterilizers, instrument washers, OR integration systems and European products performed especially well during the year, contributing to a 6% increase in capital equipment revenue, excluding the SYSTEM 1E shipments in both years. 
 Consumable revenue grew 17% and service revenue grew 23% for the year.
 Many of the investments we are making fall within our Healthcare segment. And as a result, Healthcare operating margin improvement was somewhat lower than might be expected in a year of double-digit revenue growth. The positive outcome of that, of course, is that Healthcare stands to benefit in the future from the investments we have made in in-sourcing, new products coming out of R&D and growth in synergies that we expect from our recent acquisitions.
 Life Science had another strong year of consumable growth with formulated chemistries again leading the pack. That growth was offset by a 4% decline in capital equipment revenue and a 2% decline in service revenue, resulting in overall growth of only 1% for the segment. Once again, Life Science has done a good job of managing product mix and expenses and was able to generate a 100-plus basis point improvement in operating margins for the year despite this modest growth.
 Isomedix revenue grew 8% for the year, which was all organic and reflects the filling of the capacity we have added in the past couple of years, due primarily to continued demand from our core medical device customers. Reflecting the strong growth, margins expanded nicely in this segment to end the year at almost 30%. Our plans for fiscal 2015 include additional investments to expand capacity in this segment, as volume has somewhat outstripped our expectations.
 From a business development perspective, we had a bit of a hiatus after our purchase of US Endoscopy and Spectrum TRE over a year ago, but we picked up steam again in the past several months. We have added 2 businesses to our specialty service unit and also bought a company based in the U.K. I'd like to spend a few moments on each.
 First, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired the assets of Florida Surgical Repair, an instrument repair business based in Florida for about $6 million. In the fourth quarter, we bought the assets of Life Systems, an endoscope repair business located near St. Louis, Missouri for approximately $25 million. 
 Net of tax benefit, we paid approximately $22 million or around 1x sales for Life Systems and utilized our credit facility to fund the deal. Given the size and nature of these businesses, the integration into our specialty services unit is well underway, and their results are included in the service component of our Healthcare segment.
 Outside of specialty services, we also added Eschmann Holdings Limited, a privately held U.K. company, during the fourth quarter. Eschmann designs and manufacturers a range of surgical and infection prevention products and brings a strong direct channel in the U.K. with a recognized brand name, as well as distribution around the globe. Eschmann will be integrated into our Healthcare segment. Utilizing cash held in the U.K., the purchase price in pounds converted to about USD 40 million or approximately 1x sales. For the fourth quarter, Eschmann contributed about $7 million in revenue for the Healthcare segment, of which $5 million was capital equipment and the balance was services. 
 Finally, on the first day of our new fiscal year, we announced a definitive agreement to purchase IMS for approximately $165 million, plus $10 million for real estate. Reflecting the present value of the tax benefits, the purchase price reduces to approximately $140 million.
 IMS brings strength in endoscope repair, as well as larger sales presence, particularly in the Southeastern United States. We anticipate closing the acquisition very soon. And as a result, we have included IMS in our earnings outlook for fiscal year 2015.
 Keep in mind that IMS profit margin percentages are somewhat below our current service businesses, which will impact our margin percentages for the year. Our anticipation is that we will generate long-term cost synergies, as well as growth in the business that will benefit margins in the fiscal year 2016 and beyond.
 Internally, we continue to make progress in our in-sourcing projects and expect to generate about $4 million in cost savings in fiscal 2015 as a result. That is a turnaround of about $10 million, as we invested nearly $6 million in fiscal '14. We continue to make meaningful progress and expect to generate additional savings into the foreseeable future.
 In addition, we announced a targeted restructuring program in March that includes the closing of our Hopkins Production Facility, as well as other actions. We anticipate approximately $10 million in annual cost savings as a result of these restructuring actions, which will be spread equally between fiscal '15 and '16.
 It's important to note that these cost-reduction initiatives are not completely additive to the bottom line. Efforts to improve our efficiency will help us achieve our long-term goal of growing the bottom line double-digit annual percentages over the long term. These efforts are some of the many ways we work to offset inflation in the business. We expect to continue our practice of generally raising prices lower than general inflation, thus passing some of our cost improvements through to our Healthcare customers. That is one of the ways we intend to deliver growth in revenue and profit in line with our long-term aspirations.
 Moving specifically to our outlook for fiscal 2015. We anticipate another year of double -- I can't speak, double-digit top and bottom line growth, fueled by solid organic growth and acquisitions. We expect revenue growth of 15% to 17% for the year, with mid-single digit organic growth.
 To be clear, this organic growth excludes the impact of IMS and Eschmann. With margins slightly lower than our corporate average in both of those acquired businesses, we anticipate these deals will have a slightly negative impact on operating margin percentages, which we expect to improve as we generate synergies over time.
 We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.78 to $2.91 for the year. We expect that Eschmann and IMS acquisitions will contribute approximately $0.15 of that EPS for the full year.
 For your modeling purposes, we believe that earnings timing through the year will be roughly the same as in fiscal year 2014. That would indicate approximately 40% of earnings will be generated in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. This split is being driven by the timing of R&D spending, the timing of cost savings from our in-sourcing projects and the addition of IMS, which will have significantly less impact in the first half of the fiscal year.
 We are pleased with the way our people performed in fiscal year 2014, and we look forward to our prospects in fiscal '15 and beyond. 
 With that, I will turn the call back to Julie to begin Q&A. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A session. So, Jane, would you please give the instructions, and we'll get started? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. 
Matt Mishan: I think just the first question is you have really robust sales growth for 2015, but the margins look a little flat. Can you talk about some of the differences between the sales growth and flattish margin assumptions? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. Matt, I think in my comments I mentioned that some of the acquisitions that we are making, particularly the last 2, have lower margin percentages than our average margin percentage. So they are somewhat bringing that margin percentage down. Of course, they're adding dollars to the bottom line, but they're not adding the percentages to the bottom line. That's the bulk of the reason. We're also seeing a higher growth, obviously, in the Healthcare unit than, for example, in Isomedix. So once again, since the Healthcare unit is a lower-margin business in total and then the Isomedix business, by definition, again, that tends to, in total, bring the percentages down. But the dollars are growing nicely. 
Matt Mishan: The second question, I think you saw a really good sales growth in international this quarter, big difference from the previous quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what changed quarter-over-quarter? 
Walter Rosebrough: A lot of the capital equipment answers are timing. And so just like we see in Life Science, our international businesses are relatively smaller than the North American business. So they do bounce around a little bit more timing-wise. I'll say that to begin. Well, we are seeing some pickup in the EMEA, Europe, Middle East, Africa markets. And so they had a very good quarter, but they also had a solid year. I think we've mentioned last time that we've seen more pressure in particularly Asia-Pacific markets and some of the Latin America markets, somewhat due to political issues and some due to currency issues, primarily. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. 
Lawrence Keusch: So, Walt, you obviously have been active within the Spectrum instrument repair business. I guess, I had 2 questions there, and then just one follow-up. Again, now that you've got IMS, help us understand how you're thinking about growing that business organically versus inorganically. And maybe you can also share some thoughts around the endoscope repair segment of that because it sounds like you are getting your toe into that one and maybe just some thoughts around the market and the opportunity. 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. I'll step back a little bit and say the Spectrum family, if you will, was -- did have their toe and maybe half their foot into the endoscope repair business. So it was a real piece of that business, but it was more predominantly instrument repair business. And IMS and Life Science are the exact converse. That's one of the reasons we like the combination is they have a much larger piece of their business in the endoscope repair side of the business and bring a lot more capabilities than we had in the endoscope repair business. And conversely, they also did some instrument repair. Although it's a much smaller piece of their business, but we have more capabilities, if you will, than the IMS or Life Science business. So we're bringing the strengths of the 2 businesses together so that both can do both, if you will. And a lot of it is around capability. So we believe the capabilities that are housed in the Spectrum businesses that we started with in the instrument repair area are very good and will enhance the offerings of the other 2 companies. And conversely, we think that the scope repair, both capacity and capabilities, are stronger in the Life Science and IMS side. So we very much think that, that combination creates more opportunity, really, for our customers, and then that relates to the opportunity for us. We do think that business -- both businesses are nicely growing, certainly in the high single digits, probably in the low double digits. And so we think there is significant organic growth possibility in that business, as our customers, largely hospitals but -- and others that use endoscopes, as they work to lower their cost. We believe by doing a nice job in repair and some things that they don't do, naturally, that we can actually grow our business, at the same time, reduce their overall costs. And that's the real genesis behind that business and business model, and we feel very good having more capacity on both sides of the house. So -- and I do think -- I think your comment suggests what we also believe is -- we've done a lot through acquisition, and that's based in the last 1.5 years, 2 years. Clearly, the acquisition side will slow down dramatically, relatively speaking, and the organic side will need to pick up. And that's what our plan is. 
Lawrence Keusch: Okay. Terrific. And then just quickly for Mike. If I have the numbers right, I think you're looking for free cash flow for fiscal '15 to be up about 6%. So obviously, less than net income growth. And again, I note that CapEx is up. But if you could just walk us through what are the drivers of the free cash flow generation for fiscal '15, and I suspect that the CapEx increases are in part due to the acquisition, but any thoughts would be great. 
Michael Tokich: Yes. So our -- as you had mentioned, Larry, the CapEx is planned to increase, as we are anticipating some new projects from our Isomedix, continue that expansion. Obviously, the acquisitions are going to require some capital investment also. So that's a big portion of it. We're not going to be able to give -- so that's actually a negative from a working capital standpoint. We believe we will get some adjustments in receivables, as our receivables are considerably high at the end of the year. We believe we'll get back to a more normalized level in the first quarter of next year. But from an inventory standpoint, we believe we'll be anticipating to be about flat, so we're really not going to get any improvement. Although you would imagine, we will get improvement because we're not adding inventory, even though we're adding these acquisitions. So that is not getting us additional working capital improvement that one might expect with the acquisition. So between CapEx, AR and inventory are the 3 main drivers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. 
David Turkaly: Just given the strength on the Healthcare side, I'd love to get your current thoughts on sort of yes, I guess, the capital equipment environment in general, anything on the ACA. I mean, it was a big number for you guys. So any more color on that front would be helpful. 
Walter Rosebrough: My comments on that are going to be very much like my comments have been probably the better part of the 1.5 years, maybe even 2 years. That is as we look out -- or actually, if you look at our backlog and as we look out, we continue to see buying patterns in the range of flat to slightly up. So I would not call this a robust capital equipment environment, but I also wouldn't call it a bust capital equipment environment. I think most people are flat to generally up. Now a quarter ago, when we had this conversation, we did mention that we saw the first part of this year, particularly January, that a number of customers, even if you go back into December, I guess, a number of customers had put capital on hold. So even though they said their capital budget was going to be flat to slightly up, they were holding on to the money until they saw how things were kind of working out. I would say in general, we've seen more of our customers releasing those holds than not. So I would say we're kind of in a status quo flat to low-digit improvement type of opportunity set right now. But flattish would be the right term. But we -- again, we haven't -- it's not a bust nor do we see a boom. 
David Turkaly: And then as a follow-up, I guess, if we look at this year, majority of even the growth in earnings came in this fourth quarter, which is a big number for you guys, as you kind of predicted. Are we thinking that '15 -- I know 60% in the back half, but in terms of earnings growth as well, I mean, fourth quarter as strong as this? I think it's something like 37% or close to 40% of the earnings power of the year came in the fourth quarter this year. I imagine that it may smooth out a little. Would that be fair? 
Walter Rosebrough: We don't, as you know, don't give quarterly guidance. But our best estimate is kind of the pattern we have this year. I can assure you we would rather see that flattening back into the third quarter. So if we have our druthers or if we can make it happen, we'll be trying to flatten it. Because as you saw last of this past year, we kept our factories running steady by building inventory in Q3, so we could ship the appropriate products in Q4. We would much rather build it and ship it as soon as we can and build it and hold it until we need to ship it. So we'll be working toward that end. And to the extent possible, we would rather see it be flat. But the first quarter is going to be weak relative to totals, if you will, because the IMS acquisition is not in. The 2 things we've done early on, it's not what you would call integration cost. It's just the cost of learning and doing and changing and all that. I guess, it is an integration cost, but you don't get capture -- it doesn't capture that way. But it will capture as cost. So we're expecting a little lower earnings in those businesses, as we're sorting things out, and then improvements over the course of the year. As you say, we have a lot of earnings in Q4 this year. We would certainly prefer that not be the case next year. 
David Turkaly: Last quick one. You mentioned 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA post the close. What is the -- I mean, I guess, what is the capacity? Where can that go based on the covenants as they stand today? 
Michael Tokich: Yes. Dave, the maximum covenant we have from a debt to EBITDA standpoint is 3.25x. So we still have some dry powder, if you will, a couple of hundred million of dry powder to continue, if need be, with the expansions. 
David Turkaly: And you said that the rate on that was 1.5% on the credit facility? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, true. We're about -- our credit facility is about 1.5% from an interest rate standpoint. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens Inc. 
Christopher Cooley: Just a couple of quick ones, if I may, here towards the end of the call. Walt or Mike, could you just walk us through kind of, from an execution standpoint, what has to happen with these most recent acquisitions to get their margin profile back up in line with the Healthcare and kind of the timing of how we should think about realization of those activities? And then just as an offshoot to that, you guys have been extremely busy this fiscal year. And so when you think about the business and kind of the long-term targets here, what kind of operating margin structure do you now kind of foresee as obtainable when we think about kind of longer-term objectives? 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Chris. I'll answer first the question on the how you get the margins up in the specialty service businesses, and there's a couple of factors. The first is we expect to see these businesses grow fairly robustly. And so it's not like we think we're going to go out and do massive layoffs to capture the gains. We think we can capture the bulk of the gains by letting -- by organizing the business more efficiently and letting the volume come to the people that are already there. So as a general statement, I would say that's the -- our general view is that we have a good group of people and we have plenty of them, generally speaking. We just need to organize in such a way that as the volume grows, we don't have to add people. Specifically in the field, particularly on the field service side of that, when you're growing and you have to add someone geographically or you add a unit to a geography you haven't been in, it is very inefficient at the beginning of the time you add it and then it gains efficiency over time. And so we're going to get 2 wins here, and that is first of all, we will get some automatic areas where we have people that are -- who we would have otherwise been starting up into a region possibly, and then -- and we already have people from the other company there. So we can cross-sell across the product lines that the 2 companies sell, without having to take on that first step of the geography process. So that's one. I'll call that one general way that we should get some efficiencies. The second general way is we have multiple laboratories around the country across the businesses, where we do a lot of this repair work. And we have been unable -- on both sides of the business, I mentioned that IMS is traditionally more scope repair and Spectrum is more instrument repair. Both businesses outsourced a portion of their opposite work to third parties, and so we will be able to bring in what the scope repair that we did some outsourcing in from the Spectrum side into the IMS business. And we'll be able to bring some of the instrument repair that was outsourced by IMS into the opposite side. And so we will capture those margins into our own businesses. And as we grow that volume -- it's not volume like a revenue volume, but it's volume of internal work volume. As we grow that, we expect to capture efficiency. Now that isn't going to happen tomorrow morning at 9:00. It will take time. But I would expect over the course of a couple of years, we will have that nicely captured. And, Chris, I think you had a follow-up question, and I've lost it. 
Christopher Cooley: Just long-term margins. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. We've talk about that a lot. And my view is I'd like to see those swing over 15% and creeping toward 20%. And occasionally, we get over the top of that, but that's tough. But I certainly like it to get to -- in that 15% range, and we've got -- we have a ways to go now because we're taking on some business that we think is growth business and it's great opportunity. But it will shrink our margin percentages on the Healthcare side, which, in total shrinks it somewhat. But we think we can grow those back and get back to those kind of numbers. 
Christopher Cooley: That's great. If I could squeeze maybe 2 other quick one and maybe for Mike. You mentioned there should be some incremental investment in Isomedix. Could you kind of help us think about timing of those investments so we can just think about the cash outflows and then also kind of stage -- how's that staged in our own minds kind of when that capacity could come online to drive incremental growth in the out year? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, certainly. Obviously, with our increased capital expenditures, we anticipate spending some of that cash to actually start expanding some facilities. As we've talked about in the past, it usually takes about 18 months or so to get a facility online. So if we start middle of this year, we probably will not have any impact from an opportunity standpoint to add more capacity through Isomedix until fiscal '17. But the cash outlay will be between now and the end of this fiscal year when the bulk of it at least will be spent. 
Walter Rosebrough: And, Chris, I would add, and I've commented on this before that we have multiple ways of adding capacity. You either -- you add Cobalt or you add different vessels inside current facilities or you add on to facilities or you grow new facilities. All those are ways we do it, and we're constantly doing all of those things. Occasionally, you see kind of a onetime blip because we have to go out and do a brand-new facility. That's the ones that put more pressure on earnings in the short run and they're very nice in the long run. So and -- but we're doing all those all the time. We're looking at all the different ways we can to do that, and we expect to continue that going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Erin  Wilson: Great. I saw there was an early termination notice on FTC this morning on the teaser [ph] as it relates to the IMS transaction. Is this an earlier close than you were anticipating in your guidance assumptions? 
Walter Rosebrough: So we had in our guidance, we expect it to be closing very soon, as I mentioned earlier today, and we continue to expect to close very soon. 
Erin  Wilson: Okay. So no meaningful change to your guidance there? 
Walter Rosebrough: No meaningful change. 
Erin  Wilson: Okay. And then on Isomedix, do you anticipate any changes to contract terms or ordering patterns with the potential SteriGenics-Nordion  transaction? And how would you just characterize your relationship there and your relationship with Reviz [ph] as well? Are these contracts generally structured? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. As we've mentioned a number of times the contracts we have with suppliers are long-term contracts, and so we typically will have 2 or 3 years contracts. So I'll call it for lack of a better term, the supply of Cobalt that we have coming in is contracted out for 2- or 3-year period, and it includes relative volumes and relative prices. So we generally do not expect to see disruptions in contracts -- or in our supply chain in the short to mid-term period. Over the longer term, of course, with SteriGenics potentially purchasing the Nordion business -- of course, that's all public. And as you know, publicly, they have said that they're going to need to go through the appropriate regulatory channels, I suspect, in both the U.S. and in Canada. And we'll just have to see how that works out going through channels. And clearly, we're evaluating every possible avenue for our supply chain as we always do out -- particularly out in the long run. 
Erin  Wilson: Okay, great. And an update on your international business with the recent U.K. acquisition, do you plan on building more of these services to have presence in overseas or in the U.K.? And broadly speaking kind of what are your longer-term opportunities there? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, clearly, Eschmann was a move to grow our business in the U.K. It's a very well-known company, good presence, good brand name in the U.K., good direct sales force. I should maybe have been clearer. The Eschmann business looks a lot more like our surgical and IPT business, that is, it's largely capital and then has a service component. And that service component relates to the equipment that we sell. So they do both surgical equipment and some IPT equipment, and then they have service that goes along with that. We do see that as an opportunity. As you know, about 75% of our business is in the United States. We've actually grown -- if you look at the organic side of the business, we've grown organically much faster outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. But we've -- the business we've purchased have tended to be U.S. businesses. So we've offset our organic international growth rate with acquisitions in the U.S., and that 75% has held roughly similar. We are clearly -- we have been and continue to look outside the U.S. for businesses that fit our pattern and fit what we do. And so we do see that as an opportunity. 
Operator: We have a question from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. 
Jason Rodgers: Looking at your guidance, I wonder if you could provide an estimate for the Healthcare segment growth for fiscal '14 excluding acquisitions. 
Julie Winter: For '15, Jason? 
Jason Rodgers: '15, sorry. 
Julie Winter: Yes. I believe Walt mentioned in his comments mid-single-digit organic growth is expected excluding Eschmann and IMS. 
Jason Rodgers: Okay. And you mentioned new products as a component to growth. Wondered if you could expand on any new products that you feel are noteworthy that either have just been introduced or you're planning to shortly. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. As you know, we don't comment on things that we're going to introduce. We've had really nice work, and I mentioned some of them, on the capital side. We've had nice growth and continue to see nice growth in our washer line. We basically redone the washer line. We basically redone the washer line in the last 12 months, and so that's been a nice business. We have, again, a relatively new line in our operating room integration business, and they've had very nice growth the last 12 months, and we expect to see that continuing. The -- on the surgical side, you may recall that we introduced an orthopedic product, an orthopedic table during last year. And as is always the case with capital equipment, it kind of take some time to pick up and get people to understand what's out there. So we are now seeing some good growth in that business. So that's I think on the capital side -- or the one I should say, the European product lines, both the EMS systems and their lights and tables have grow nicely. So we've had a good set of good run in those product areas. On the consumable side, again our ICC business continues to grow. The Prolystica general family of businesses continue to grow nicely. The US Endoscopy, which comes in on the consumable side of our business, they have continued what we would hope they would do, which is continue their pattern of developing new products and growing about 50% of their growth the last -- these last 12 months has been from products introduced in the last couple of years. And we expect that to continue going forward. So they have a number of new products that are coming into the market. So it's generally across the board, and there's a little bit of rotation. You can't do everything all -- you can't do each product all the time, but we generally kind of rotate through the products and make sure that we're keeping them fresh and keep new products in front of our customers. So we continue to expect to do that. I failed to mention V-PRO in the consumables, that go with V-PRO. That's also been a very strong growth for us, so we expect to see that continue. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Just quick questions. Walt, I believe you mentioned the pace of acquisitions will be slowing down. And I'm just wondering if the question of you have so much on your plate, you need to integrate right now or are there just fewer opportunities out there. 
Walter Rosebrough: I was speaking specifically about acquisitions in the specialty service space. And that is -- we felt that we needed a certain set of capabilities to be able to have a good -- very good spot to provide great value to our customers. And we feel that we've gathered that sort of capabilities now. So it's not to say that we wouldn't do opportunistic acquisitions in that space. If they came up, we would. But in terms of feeling like we needed to do some other significant component to have a good package, we don't really feel that way. So that -- I was really directing my comments there. Now we do have some significant integration work to be done obviously, but it's largely in that specialty service space. Eschmann is a relatively small business. It will fit nicely into our capital business in Healthcare. So I don't see that being a large integration problem. The real integration is occurring in the specialty services space. So we would feel that we have capacity to do other acquisitions outside of that space. I think we're going to let those guys sort that work out. They've got a lot of work to do. We'll let them sort that out. In the next little bit, we'll be looking predominantly in other areas. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And then just as a quick follow-up there. Given the Eschmann acquisition, the potential you're seeing on the international front, if you had to take sort of a longer-term look, how do you see the mix of business changing in terms of international versus U.S. from where it is today? 
Walter Rosebrough: We've been saying forever that we expected the international business to grow faster than the U.S. business. We still feel the same way, particularly -- and I would characterize it as we expect to see the non-industrial world, if you will, business grow faster than the historic industrial world business, Healthcare in general. And we have been and would continue to follow that trend. But as opportunities come up where we're already strong, the U.S. and now even more so in Europe, we clearly would really take those opportunities. Because even though those markets will not grow as rapidly as the OUS business, I'll call it, even though they won't grow as rapidly, they're still growing business, they're a very solid business. And we want to maintain our significant presence and be able to create value for the customers in that business. So some of it we'll be opportunistic based on what is available and some of it we'll be directionally for the direction. And we clearly are working to grow that business and organically have been growing the OUS business faster since we bought things that tend to be in the U.S. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back for closing remarks. 
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for joining us, and have a great day.

Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie. Good morning everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our third quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Walt will provide his perspective on key elements of the quarter and review our outlook for the full fiscal year. As usual, my comments this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please see the reconciliation table included in our press release for additional details.
 Let me now begin with a review of our third quarter income statement. Total revenue grew 7% during the third quarter driven by a 5% increase in organic volume, a 1.5% increase from acquisitions and a 50 basis point improvement in pricing. Foreign currency was neutral to revenue during the quarter. During the quarter, we experienced double digit revenue growth in the United States offset by an 8% decline in international revenues.
 Gross margin dollars increased 6% in the quarter, due mainly to the increase in revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter was flat at 40.4%. We have several factors impacting gross margin in the quarter. Medical device excise tax continue to reduce gross margins by 50 basis points year-over-year. On top of that, we had anticipated that our in-sourcing projects would be net P&L neutral in the third quarter; instead, we incurred almost $2 million in expense during the quarter.
 For the full year, our expectations now include approximately $6 million of insourcing expenses, about double from what we anticipated last quarter. In addition, gross margin during the quarter was impacted by approximately $1 million due to organic investments we have made to expand our Spectrum instrument repair business into new territories throughout the United States. The increase in volume did improve EBIT by 8% to $62.5 million in the quarter. EBIT at 15.4% of revenue increased both sequentially and year-over-year driven by increased volume offset by higher R&D expenses, which increased $1.2 million compared to the prior year.
 The effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.9% compared with 36.4% last year. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was higher than our typical operating rate, primarily as a result of discrete item adjustments and our inability to recognize the potential tax benefits of operating losses in certain international locations. As a result, net income increased to $34.9 million or $0.59 per diluted share compared with $34.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share last year.
 Moving onto our segment results. Healthcare had a good quarter, growing revenue 8% in total and 6% organically. Healthcare capital equipment revenue grew 4%. Consumable revenue increased 6% and service revenue grew 15%. Service organic revenue growth, which excludes Spectrum, was 10% in the quarter, driven by strength in the United States. Even with strong shipments of capital equipment, healthcare backlog increased double digits sequentially and year-over-year, ending the quarter at a record $156 million. Healthcare operating income increased 5% to $37.5 million in the third quarter. The increase in operating income year-over-year, primarily driven by increased volume somewhat offset by the medical device excise tax, increased R&D expenses and investments in both in-sourcing and Spectrum as discussed earlier.
 Life Sciences revenue decline 1% during the quarter. Strong performance of consumable revenue which grew 8% and 2% growth in service revenue were more than offset by a 10% decline in capital equipment revenue. As you know, capital equipment shipments within this segment tend to vary from quarter-to-quarter. Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $48.5 million; a decline of 2% compared with the prior year, but remained at a level consistent with historic backlog level. Life Sciences’ third quarter operating margin of 18.9% of revenue is down slightly from the prior year.
 Revenue for Isomedix increased 13% in the quarter to $49.2 million. Expanded capacity contributed to revenue growth within the segment. In addition, the prior year includes business disruption from Hurricane Sandy, making the comparison versus prior year somewhat easier. Isomedix’s operating margin was 28.6% of revenue, an increase of 300 basis points as compared to the prior year. Remember, this is a high fixed cost business, so the additional volumes benefit margin substantially.
 In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $157 million of cash and $475 million in long-term debt. For your modeling purposes I do want to point out that we have paid down $70 million of private placement debt, which matured throughout the fiscal year, using a combination of cash on hand and our existing credit facility. By doing this, we should be able to reduce our interest expense by approximately $0.5 million in the fourth quarter based on current short-term interest rates.
 Our accounts receivable balance of $267.7 million is up from the prior year due to increased volumes. DSO, however, has improved by 1 day and is currently at 62 days. We remain comfortable with our current leverage profile of debt to total capital of 32% and debt to EBITDA of 1.7x. Our free cash flow for the first9 months of fiscal 2014 was $82.1 million compared to $117.1 million in the prior year. Similar to last quarter, the expected decline in free cash flow is primarily due to payment of our annual incentive compensation program, which did not occur in the prior year, as well as the impact of strong working capital improvement in the prior year. Capital spending was $17.7 million in the quarter while depreciation and amortization was $19.6 million.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us to review our third quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year.  
 As you have heard from Mike, we had another good quarter, although it was not as strong as we had anticipated.  There are a few reasons for that which I will address in my comments. Mike has already reviewed our segment, so I’d like to touch on a few broad highlights. From a geographic perspective, we had very good growth in the United States, where revenue grew 12% in the quarter. This reflected double digit organic growth in all 3 segments and we are clearly very pleased with that performance. Within healthcare we were also pleased to see strength on an organic basis in the U.S. across all product areas: capital equipment, consumables and service. We continue to see a stable to modest growth business outlook in the U.S. and our strong third quarter shipment bubbles and record backlog in healthcare at the end of the quarter reflects that strength. 
 Outside the U.S., we faced challenges in several markets that have hindered our revenue growth and profitability. This is due to weakness in certain countries that have historically been strong for STERIS. Much of Southeast Asia and certain countries in Latin America have been particularly hard hit this year from a STERIS perspective. Some of the issue is the general economic dynamics within the given countries and regions and that is compounded by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and of the euro, which makes our products more expensive than local market competitors. This currency movement has been generally true in both Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. In terms of our overall profitability, currency has had a negative impact of about 2% on both the Q3 and the year-to-date profit performance, even though it has had negligible impact on revenue.
 Turning to our business development efforts, we have now passed the 1-year anniversary of the US Endoscopy acquisition and the business continues to meet or exceed our expectations. During the third quarter we also hit the 1-year mark for Spectrum which is also doing well. As we have told you from the announcement of the Spectrum deal, we plan on growing this business through a combination of organic growth and M&A. We’ve begun to invest in organic growth by adding trucks and staff in additional regions. This investment has had a modest impact on our profit, and will until those new assets and people generate enough revenue to cover their cost which generally takes about a year. In addition we made an acquisition during the quarter in this space as we acquired a regional player in the Southeastern United States on December 31. We paid about $6 million for that business.
 Our pipeline for M&A remains full. Our BD team has been busy looking at a number of opportunities. Of course, we’re generally not able to dictate the timing of those projects, but we are working to continue our strategy of expanding into adjacent markets through business development.
 From a profitability perspective, Mike has already covered the main issues in the quarter. I'd like to expand a bit on our insourcing projects before moving on to our outlook. We continue to believe our insourcing projects will create the value we expected. These are not trivial projects. In hindsight we were a bit aggressive in our timeframe plan and have had a few glitches that have slowed our progress. As we discussed last quarter, one issue is the hiring and training of the appropriate skilled labor needed in our facilities. While we've made progress on that front, we’re still not yet where we planned to be. In addition some of the design issues of insourced products and parts have taken longer than we planned. Finally, some of the projects required changes in building and equipment, which have experienced some delays. We have every confidence that we will complete these projects and generate the improvements in cost, quality and delivery as expected. We continue to believe that we will see $8 million to $10 million in annual cost savings when the projects are complete. It is just taking us a bit longer to get there than we anticipated. For those looking on to our FY '15 year, we still expect to achieve the $4 million to $7 million in pretax cost savings next year from these efforts that we discussed last quarter.
 Moving on to our outlook. We are expecting a record fourth quarter in both revenue and profit and anticipate that the full year revenue growth will be within our prior 8% to 10% range at approximately 9%. As I have mentioned already, this is largely a result of the strength in the U.S. business. However, we feel it is prudent to trim our earnings per share outlook for the full year to reflect the impact of a higher effective tax rate, the decline in international results and continued investments in in-sourcing in Spectrum. We are adjusting our EPS guidance for the full year to be in the range of $2.42 to $2.49 compared with the previously provided guidance in the lower half of the range, $2.47 to $2.60. Absent the impact of the medical device excise tax, this revised guidance would have us at 6% to 9% growth above last year’s results. Although not quite where we had hoped to be, still a solid year when the impact of the device tax and currency movement is taken into account. We continue to be encouraged by our progress as well as the long-term prospects of our business. 
 For modeling purposes for the fourth quarter, I'd like to add a few comments. First, we are anticipating expansion of both gross margin and EBIT margin, driven by organic top line growth and careful cost control. Clearly the majority of the leverage in the quarter will come from SG&A. In particular, in the fourth quarter of last year we incurred substantial expenses related to our annual incentive compensation program, which we anticipate being meaningfully lower this year given that our 100% bonus target is in line with the top of our original EPS range. In addition, as Mike mentioned, our non-operating expenses have benefited from paying off higher-rate debt over the last 2 quarters. All that being said, we know we have a lot of work to do to deliver on our expectations for the quarter and we feel positioned to do so.
 With that, I will hand the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A session. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. We’re now ready to begin the Q&A, so Jane, would you please give the instructions and we’ll get started. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. 
David Turkaly: It looks like in Healthcare, a good performance and even pricing overall for you guys positive. I guess I can't help myself now that we're into this ACA, and the calendar changed, any new thoughts there on the capital spending environment? I know your backlog is large, so I'd imagine – I mean any update in terms of how you see things playing out this year and next? 
Michael Tokich: I'm certainly not going to try for next year. But for this year, I would say we are generally experiencing similar kind of trends as we were last year. That is most of our customers, when we talk to them, are saying that they're going to be spending about the same in capital for our type of equipment that they did in 2013, or maybe up a little bit, a couple percentage points, very similar to our conversation last year at this time. Having said that, we have heard from a number of customers that they are going to – even though their plan is to do kind of flat or up a couple percentage points, that they're going to hang onto a few of those dollars early on in the year to see how things work out for them, and so we’re seeing some people being more cautious at the front end of the year. The counter of that is we've actually seen several of those people who said they were holding on starting to release funds. So at this point I'd say it’s too early to call. I think hospitals will be a bit cautious going into this year. But we’re already seeing them beginning to implement their plans. And you're right, we do have a solid backlog right now which is a good thing to have at this point in time. 
David Turkaly: As a quick follow-up, you mentioned M&A and the pipeline being slow. How broad do you envision that Spectrum business becoming? And what kind of coverage do you have today? Are there a lot of opportunities specifically in that area for you guys to get larger? 
Michael Tokich: Well, we believe that there's a lot of opportunity. First we think that business is a growing business, and then second, we think we can grow within that business. We do have parts of the country where we’re geographically stronger and parts of the country where we’re geographically weaker. And like all service businesses it is somewhat local, and so we think we have opportunity there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. 
Lawrence Keusch: Well, I just want to make sure that I’m understanding one aspect here. You mentioned that -- or Mike may have mentioned it, on a pretax basis you’re still anticipating the same amount of savings associated with the insourcing programs, but at the same time you obviously spoke to delays and issues that cropped up as you kind of put this all together. So what allows you to catch up to get to where you thought you were going to be in that? How do we get comfortable with that? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, I would say it would not be a fair characterization to say that we will catch up. That is, and I’m going to separate 2 conversations, one is where we will eventually be and the other is when we will eventually be there. So far in the work that we are doing, we are – for the -- I’ll call it the percentage of work that’s complete, the number of parts and/or products that we have completed, we are seeing the expected level of savings in those parts and products. And so we’re not seeing anything that discourages us from feeling that the ultimate savings objectives and for that matter, quality and delivery objectives will not be met. The issue is -- and this percentage is not at all correct, but let’s say we thought we were supposed to be 40% down the path today or 50% down the path today, we’re only 20 or 30% down the path today. So we will be slower than we originally expected and that slowness creates – there's front end costs that we load in. We've purchased machinery which we’re not appreciating which is not -- some of it not running at full capacity or the capacity we expected. We have spent money in order to do the work and we’re not receiving as much benefit as we expected. So it’s strictly a matter of kind of the percentage of amount of work we have done and we’ve -- probably it's a bit more work than we thought originally to get that amount done. But the percentage of work that we have done compares to the percentage we thought we would be. So we’re not at all dissuaded from our view of $8 million to $10 million, it’s just a matter of when it comes in the door. And our expectation still is that relatively speaking we’ll be in that $4 million to $7 million range for next year; this calendar year, our fiscal next year we'll be in that $4 million to $7 million range. We’re not feeling like we’re going to off of that. But so I think -- I hope I’ve been clear on kind of the ultimate objective which will be later than we originally expected, and the timing of that objective. But in terms of the actual work that we had done to-date, we are seeing the kind of improvements that we expected. 
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, that was really helpful, and then just 2 quick financial questions. So again I just wanted to make sure that I’m clear, as you think about the fourth quarter that you are suggesting that you do anticipate gross margin being higher but to get to the implied EPS that you’re talking about, the majority of the leverage is going to come from SG&A, that’s one question? And then also on the effective tax rate given where you are for the 9 months and what you’re suggesting for the year end, the fourth quarter tax rate implied would be lower than the kind of first half of the year which I’ll call more normalized, and again I just wanted to make sure I’m thinking about that and if that’s true, why would that be the case. 
Michael Tokich: Yes, let me address the tax issue first. Most of that differential that we have seen is due to specific discrete item adjustments which has caused our rate to be higher in the third quarter. And we anticipate favorable discrete item adjustments in the fourth quarter which is going to cause our rate to be lower, to give you some perspective there as to why we believe your thinking is correct on the tax rate. And as far as improvements in the fourth quarter, obviously the biggest one that Walt talked about is our bonus and that is about a $5 million impact, year-over-year reduction in SG&A expense versus higher SG&A expenses in last year’s fourth quarter. So that is the big improvement, in addition to the volume that we anticipate coming through which should help our gross margin both dollars and percent in the fourth quarter. 
Walter Rosebrough: I used that word loosely, when you said improvement, as it relates to our bonus, but we are a pay for performance company and we have that culture. And last year we had an exceedingly strong finish and so we were above our bonus levels, our 100% level. This year we hit what we had told you we were going to hit.  We will be below our 100% bonus level. So the differential is something under 100% for this year versus something over 100% last year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley, with Stephens. 
Christopher Cooley: Could you help me out just briefly first on the margin side? Specifically what I want to better understand is the operating margin for life sciences in the quarter. Strong growth there in both consumables and service with the lower capital component. I would have thought that the operating would have been higher. Can you just kind of walk us through the puts and takes there and I guess what’s implicit and why it snaps back in the fiscal 4Q? And kind of along those same lines, with Isomedix it’s pretty much in line with expectations for us. But I'm wondering if we can get that business back up over 30% again or at 30%? Is that just a function of utilization? And I've just got one follow-up. 
Michael Tokich: Yes, Chris, in regards to the Life Sciences operating margin, I mean last quarter we set a record operating margin of almost 22% or so and we said that, that is not something that we believe is sustainable. We believe that upper teens in this business is where our sustainability lies. And your point is well taken about capital, but it really is the mix as every quarter we have different products that are selling and those products tend to have higher or lower gross margins generating that. So it’s really all about the mix within this quarter and the lower volume compared to the prior year that is driving that EBIT margin percent a little bit lower. 
Walter Rosebrough: And I guess the follow-on to Isomedix is Isomedix will wax and wane somewhat as we bring capacity on and fill that capacity. And we did again set kind of a high watermark earlier in the year. And we are going to as always -- we used to have kind of larger chunks of capacity coming in and out, we're trying to have those capacity increases or improvements build more ratably over time. Every once in a while you have to build a whole new facility and then you see significant capacity cost early on. But we always strive for improvements in our margins. But I think Isomedix was getting – is getting right up there. It is worth mentioning that they have significant capital expenditure exposure, so they need to have those good margins on an ROS basis to have appropriate capital returns, which they do have. But we’re pushing pretty high watermarks on Isomedix right now. 
Christopher Cooley: Understood. And then if I could just follow back up on the insourcing discussion. Appreciate the prepared remarks and that you still expect to see the $4 million to $7 million in pretax cost savings from related initiative there in fiscal ‘15. But what I wasn’t clear about was if there was a updated timeline and when you thought you could actually bring this project to completion? And I know you don't want to give ‘15 guidance yet, but can you give us maybe some color around a little bit of a delay here but when you think you might bring this to a close? 
Michael Tokich: Sure, Chris. And I think I spoke about this last quarter if not the quarter before a little more broadly about what we’re kind of loosely characterizing as this project. It’s really not this project, it’s really kind of the way forward for us and that’s the first point. The second point is that this is not a project; this is 6 or 7 projects, some of which are across multiple plans. And so some of those projects are dependent on each other and some of them are independent of each other. And so there's not a real answer to the, when will the project be concluded. Now what we have described to you all in terms of the orders of magnitude spending and the orders magnitude savings, we’re clustering those several projects into a project if you will. But we’ll start new ones next year, next year, next year, I'm sure. The order of magnitude of these are fairly significant which is why we group them together and look for that $8 million to $10 million savings. Some of them are coming kind of to conclusion right now and others are continuing. I think now we would say obviously the $4 million to $7 million, since that’s roughly half of what the objective is, we should expect that we’re about half complete in this coming – our current coming fiscal year, and then the balance will come in the following year. I would think that all or virtually all would be completed in the FY '16 timeframe. Certainly we would be expecting that $8 million to $10 million to be almost all captured if not all captured in that FY '16. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson with Merrill Lynch. 
Erin  Wilson: Could you speak to, I guess the factors impacting the gross margin in the quarter? It was a little soft in light of the seemingly capable product mix. Has there been in any meaningful changes in how your customers are purchasing your product? Is it shifting more to GPOs or what have been the dynamics on that front over the past year or so? And how should we expect that to trend over the next 3 to 5 years? 
Michael Tokich: Erin, I would say there's been no radical change in percentage of business being purchased in GPOs or by GPOs, there's been no significant change in pricing, per se. I think this – and I'm talking now about healthcare, I think where you’re primarily pointing. And if I remember right, our healthcare pricing was up about 0.5 point for the quarter. That’s not unusual kind of number. So I don’t think that we’re seeing any radical shift there. I think most of our products, by far, the vast majority of our products have been on GPO contracts for years, if not decades and we have been working with all of the major GPOs for years, if not decades. It's unlike, I will say unlike, what I'll call the classic physician preference type of medical devices where many of them have not been significantly impacted by GPO pricing and GPO interaction. That’s virtually unheard of in our 85%, 90% of our product. We are almost always under some form of contract. So I don’t know of any significant change this quarter versus last. So the only differences would be those of mix and volume and the factors that drive the change in gross margins on the healthcare side. 
Walter Rosebrough: In addition, I just want to add that the insourcing and Spectrum investment are all healthcare in gross margin. 
Michael Tokich: And also we put the med device tax in gross margin. Some companies put it in OpEx so you have to pay attention to that. But we’ve discussed all those before, but those would be the drivers as opposed to any kind of, I’ll call it general change in contracting and pricing. 
Erin  Wilson: Okay. Got it. That’s helpful. On guidance, it's still a pretty broad range for the fourth quarter. What are kind of the key risks or kind of points of upside that gets either the high versus low end of that range? I know you spoke just a little bit but I’m just trying to get more confident in -- or what gives you confidence, I guess in the ramp up in the fourth quarter. 
Michael Tokich: The range is relatively large for a 1-quarter guidance. We agree with you and the reason for that, it’s also one heck of a big quarter in terms of the performance we’re expecting. I would say the single -- if you took a single point in question, the single point is volume. We have a very big volume keyed up for the quarter. And when you see a backlog as high as ours is, that is not surprising. So the backlog is high, the volume is high. The biggest question will always be in the last 3 weeks, does this customer who had this $3 million project that he supposedly wanted on March 15, all of a sudden their project is 4 weeks late, therefore they want it on April 15. And so the biggest single issue, and that’s true in the capital business, it's true in both Life Science and healthcare. On a percentage basis it's more true in Life Science because they’re smaller, so one big $3 million order changes their numbers a lot. On healthcare, one $3 million order changes it not so much on a percentage basis but it still can drop $1 million or $1.5 million or $2 million to the bottom line depending on what the products are. So it is purely a matter of volume, almost exclusively capital volume that we would expect to be the driver of that question. And as I said, how the hospitals act in their first quarter of this year, with ACA is our fourth quarter. So we put a little more range of uncertainty around that, although again, from everything they’re telling us, we think the calendar year will probably turn out about right. So that’s at a high level. And there will be other bits and bobs, what happens in currency, what happens on a couple of other issues but I would say the big driver is volume. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Greg Halter with Great Lakes. 
Gregory Halter: Wonder if you can update us on the share repurchase program, looks like there was maybe $5 million or so in the quarter, but just wanted to get an update there. 
Michael Tokich: Yes, Greg, for the year we’ve spent about $22.5 million and that is about just over 515,000 shares that we bought. And of that about $4 million or just below 90 million shares were bought in the quarter – or sorry, 90,000, yes, not 90 million, sorry. We have $89 million left on the authorization in total that was granted by the board a couple years ago. And again remember, we’re trying to offset any dilution from the option, grants and exercises, I mean that’s really our main purpose right now with our share repurchase program. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And relative to the tax rate and your indication of not being able to use I think some of the operating losses in certain international locations, any idea when those could be realized or utilized? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, the one nice thing about it, obviously we’ve made a decision that this year we will not be able to use them which is different than our original plan, obviously, as we’ve increased our expected tax rate for the year. The 2 areas that the valuation allowance are put on, we have valuation allowance in a couple different entities. Most of those are indefinite lives so we don’t have a risk of losing those, so as we improve our operations in those foreign entities, we will be able to get really a double benefit as we do get income from those operations and we will be able to use the deferred tax asset here, to also offset the -- and improve the effective tax rate. 
Michael Tokich: And I would even add further, Greg, that it’s not like we had these huge NOLs in these countries, these are relatively small NOLs, so it’s not an overwhelming task to get those back. 
Gregory Halter: If you had to put a percent on the 2 components that you mentioned for the 40%, approximate 40% of tax rate, the discrete items and then these operating losses not being able to use, what kind of percentage would you attribute for each of those? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, about 1/3, 2/3, percent-wise. 
Gregory Halter: Two-thirds for the discrete items? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, I would say definitely 2/3 for the discrete items. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And on the insourcing, I believe last quarter while you may have mentioned that you’ve been having some difficulty as a lot of people have in obtaining welders, skilled labor issues and so forth, just wondered if you could update us on what you’re seeing in that regard. 
Michael Tokich: That’s exactly right. That was one of the -- in one of the projects that was one on the delaying factors, and we have had – we've made progress in hiring both types of people, both welders and skilled laborers, machine operators really. And we’ve had success adding those people but we continue to add more so -- or want more and need more and add more. So we’re still behind where we’d like to be, but we’ve made progress. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And relative to your backlog… 
Michael Tokich: I might mention, Greg, we consider all 3 of those items discrete item adjustments. So the characterization, the breakdown of those are all -- they were all temporal discrete item adjustments. And so kind of the breakdown of why they were discrete item adjustments is a bit arbitrary. So there's -- all these apply back to longer periods than the quarter and so we’re taking them in the quarter and that’s why we don’t expect to see a similar number that's in the next quarter for example. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And that was back on the tax rate, correct? 
Michael Tokich: Back on the tax rate. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And moving to the backlog. Is it at a record due to Steris not being able to deliver anything or is the demand running ahead of shipments? 
Michael Tokich: No, it’s demand ahead of shipments and/or oftentimes, Greg, we have -- basically our business is in 2 buckets; one we call it replacement and the other is big projects. And the big projects almost always had a future delivery date out 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, those kind of things. And the replacements tend to be more, ship it when you can or ship in a month type of products. And so it’s a mixture of those and that’s what creates the shipping schedules. But we have been ramping up our facilities to be able to ship the numbers that we’re talking about. And we did have -- we have had over the 1.5 months, some of our facilities a little weather delay kind of issue, so we’ve had a couple little shutdowns. I’m talking like a day or 1.5 days because ice or snow or power, like everybody’s having these days. But other than that, we’re not seeing any significant difference. 
Gregory Halter: Any comment on new products on the horizon that you may want to talk about here? 
Michael Tokich: I'm sorry? 
Gregory Halter: Any new products on the horizon that you may want to update us on? 
Michael Tokich: No, we don’t -- as you know we don’t talk about products going forward. Anyway we have -- we are very pleased with our products that we have in the marketplace now. We’ve updated our sterilizer line, it’s doing nicely; we’ve update our V-PRO products, they are moving nicely. On the US Endoscopy side, that’s a business where private development is a key to their success and if you look at the products that they've put out in the last couple of years, they are doing very nicely. They’re probably 40% to 50% of the growth of that business. So kind of across the board we’re feeling good about the products that we have out there. As always, some better than others, but as a general statement we like our product development, what we have in the market and we have more coming. But nothing that I would kind of point out as a single point home run at this point. 
Gregory Halter: All right. And one last one, I believe that we had an estimate for capital expenditures of about $90 million for the year, fiscal year, is that still on track? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Greg, that is still our estimate, $90 million for the year. 
Operator: We have another question from Chris Cooley. 
Christopher Cooley: Just 2 quickies here. Mike, could you maybe give us some color on the tuck-in acquisition. This is a lot smaller, obviously, than Spectrum or TRE. I’m just trying to get a feel for the multiple and kind of what you got with that. And then maybe from a bigger picture standpoint from Walt’s perspective, you had a great quarter when you looked at capital and you have a record backlog as we go into the fiscal 4Q. Yet capital spending trends really aren’t changing much, at least from what we can see here, new builds aren’t increasing. Can you just maybe -- and you touched on this a little bit in the prior caller, but are you seeing any change in the mix between maybe replacement or competitive bid? Just trying to get a feel for the underlying drivers in the short term for demand. 
Michael Tokich: Sure, Chris. The first question about the tuck-in, that is exactly what it is, it is a tuck-in regional player in the space that Spectrum is in, and it is a nice tuck-in to that. They had a strong market presence in that region and we were able to work it out with the owners who are staying with the business that we would purchase the business and bring it in for the Spectrum family. So it’s a pure Spectrum tuck-in. For businesses this size, we don’t get into the multiples, but I can say it was certainly in the range of what we paid for the Spectrum acquisition. So ballpark similar. But it's $6 million, so it’s not a big business, relatively speaking. The second question you asked about capital spending in general. And I think I’ve tried to answer it and I’ll try to be more clear. In terms of the year going forward, it appears to us from the best information we have that hospitals will be spending something on the order of flat to slightly up in total capital spending. And so not -- this isn't a 10% growth year go forward capital spending. It looks more like again, flat to maybe couple of percentage points. And then the follow-on is do think -- it wouldn’t surprise us if we see a little bit of hesitancy in their first quarter, in terms of order rates and as a result may see a little slowdown in orders. We haven’t really experienced that to-date although there have been people who have projects who have said, hey, we’re going to hold on for a couple of months, see how things go before we make the final commitment. We’re still planning on doing it. And we’ve actually seen a couple of those release those orders where they were holding on and they're feeling confident enough that they’ve gone ahead and released. So it’s a little bit of a mixed bag. But at this point, we don’t call it any different than we called it last year at the same time. I think that’s pretty much it. And we will, obviously, be watching that because it’s important. And we’ve had -- just we’ve had a very nice kind of back half for the year in order rates. So we've got a good backlog to go into that, which you like to have if there's a little softness in the quarter. It’s nice to have some backlog going in. In terms of replacement versus project, I wouldn’t characterize it as competitive or not competitive. We think everyone is competitive. It’s just that the large projects come in lumpier portions. But the individual orders and the large projects, we haven't seen a radical change in those numbers in the last 1.5 years. They kind of moved around during the crisis, we saw the projects hold up and the replacements go away during the financial crisis 2, 3 years ago and then they’ve kind of moved back into their normal alignment. 
Operator: We have a question from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Just following up on that first. Walter, you say the mix that relates to new build outs versus renovation is still around that 60-40 level? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. And again, when you look at the healthcare backlog level… 
Walter Rosebrough: [indiscernible] other way, renovation is more than 60% and new build out -- we don’t really break it that way. We break into is it a big project, because a new tower or a gutted and redone tower to us is the same kind of project. It’s a big project, there's usually lot of dollars involved, there's lot of effort involved. So we kind of look at it as large project versus relatively small in 2 table orders and 2 light orders that kind of things. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. No, that’s good. And again, coming back to the backlog levels that we’ve seen in healthcare. It's clearly, I think about the highest we’ve had in about 3 years. Is it really a case where you’re really encouraged in terms of what you’re seeing with the overall capital spending environment in hospitals, et cetera, starting to be a lot freer with their budgets? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, I’m encouraged when they say they’re going to grow 10%. And they’re not saying that, I’m just not discouraged because they’re not saying they’re going to go down 10% or 20%. I think they’re saying we're staying the course of about what we spent last year and maybe up a couple percentage points. So it’s not like – it's not a gangbuster look in the short run, but nor is it a gloom and doom look. So I'd say we're in the middle. But relatively speaking to what capital can as you know when uncertainty rises, capital can slow down, and at this point we're not seeing it. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. And finally just on the international front, and I know you said sales were certainly a little soft because of lot of country-specific issues. Is there anything you can do in terms of sort of offsetting that or is this pretty much you just have to take a wait and see approach? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, I mean of course we work to do better in the countries that are having issues. But I mean if you just kind of think through what's going on in Venezuela, Thailand, Egypt, Argentina, those countries have significant economic and/or political disruption. And since most healthcare is run by government entities or much of healthcare is run by government entities, that can impact particularly capital spending. It may not impact the routine spending as much. So people are still going to the hospital, but folks may not be -- governments may not be deciding to spend a lot of money on capital when they are under significant pressure. Because most governments, as you know, capital is not treated -- capital is treated as an expense so their budget is kind of a cash budget and/or they may have cash issues. The secondary, the piece that pushes that even further is the fact that they are -- is that their currency have fallen. And where we have the areas that I mentioned in Latin America and Asia Pacific, they have fallen versus the dollar and the euro. Since we tend to manufacture things in the U.S. and Europe, that raises our cost relative to either their ability to pay and/or to local manufacturers. So that puts the pressure on our business. But of course, our job is to find ways to lower our cost and have products that are better and look for the opportunities where they apply. That’s what we are doing and intend to do. 
Operator: I am showing no other questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back for any closing remarks. 
Julie Winter: Great. Thanks, Jane, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and have a great day. 
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q2  (2013-10-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the STERIS Fiscal 2014 Second Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At the request of STERIS, today's call will be recorded for instant replay.
 I'd now like to introduce today's host, Julie Winter, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.

 With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you with this morning to review our second quarter financial results. As usual, my comments this morning regarding total company and healthcare results will be based on adjusted figures. Please see the reconciliation table included in our press release for additional details.
 Let me now begin with a review of our second quarter income statement. Total revenue grew 14% during the second quarter, driven by a 10% increase from acquisitions, a 3% increase in organic volume and a 1% improvement in pricing. Foreign currency was neutral to revenue during the quarter.
 Gross margin, at 40.3%, represents an increase of 90 basis points over the prior year. The increase is driven by 140 basis points from acquisitions and 60 basis points from price. This increase was somewhat offset by our investments in in-sourcing along with the medical device excise tax, each of which was approximately $2 million.
 EBIT improved $7.8 million in the quarter. EBIT at 14.3% of revenue increased both sequentially and year-over-year. Year-over-year, EBIT as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points as gross margin improvements were somewhat offset by higher R&D expenses.
 R&D expense in the quarter increased $3.7 million compared to the prior year and includes almost $1 million related to a disallowance of foreign R&D government subsidies. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 35.2% compared with 29.4% last year. The prior year tax rate is lower due to the timing of discrete item adjustments. As a result, net income increased to $32.6 million or $0.55 per diluted share compared with $30.9 million or $0.53 per diluted share last year.
 Moving on to our segment results, healthcare revenue in the quarter grew 17%. Healthcare capital equipment revenue grew 3% including a negative 1% impact from our SYSTEM 1E year-over-year unit sales decline. This is our final quarter to be impacted by the SYSTEM 1, 1E transition.
 Healthcare consumable revenue increased 26%, driven by both acquisitions and organic growth. Consumable organic growth during the quarter was a positive 3%. Service revenue grew 34%, driven by both acquisitions and organic growth. Service organic growth during the quarter increased 6%. Healthcare backlog increased double digits both sequentially and year-over-year, ending the quarter at $133 million. Healthcare operating income increased 14% to $30.3 million in the second quarter.
 The increase in operating income year-over-year was primarily driven by the acquisitions and increased volume. This increase was somewhat offset by the medical device excise tax, increased R&D expense and investments in in-sourcing.
 Life Sciences revenue increased 7% during the quarter. Consumable revenue had another good quarter of growth, up 8%, while service revenue was flat. Capital equipment revenue grew 13% in the quarter and, as per usual, capital equipment shipments within this segment tend to vary from quarter-to-quarter.
 Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $47.8 million, a decline of 6% compared with the prior year but an increase of 7% compared to the first quarter. Life Sciences' second quarter operating income set an all-time high at 24.1% of revenue. While we are pleased with this quarter's operating margin rate, it was unusually high, as we experienced a very favorable gross-margin mix within Life Sciences' capital equipment business.
 Revenue for Isomedix increased 7% in the quarter to $47.4 million. Isomedix operating margin was 28.9% of revenue, an increase of 30 basis points as compared to the prior year. During the quarter we did have success in filling our expanded capacity. However, at the same time, we did have several chambers offline during the quarter for maintenance purposes and did experience higher repairs and maintenance costs, both of which did have a slight drag on our operating margin in the quarter.
 In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $164 million of cash and $509 million in long-term debt. We remain comfortable with our current leverage profile of total debt to capital of 34% and total debt to EBITDA of 1.7x.
 Our free cash flow for the first 6 months was $32.9 million compared with $67 million in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow is primarily due to the payments of our annual incentive compensation program, which did not occur in the prior year, as well as the impact of strong working capital improvements in the prior year. Capital spending was $25.4 million in the quarter while depreciation and amortization was $17.8 million.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. Now that you've heard an overview of our results from Mike, I will spend my time focused on a few highlights and our outlook for the year.
 As we told you in August, we believed that our first quarter results were largely a matter of timing and not a change in underlying demand or sustainability and profitability. We are pleased to report results today that reflect those views with substantial improvement sequentially and strong indicators for our second half.
 As we have said for some time now, we continue to see generally stable market trends in the United States and believe the market is growing modestly. Our healthcare segment delivered organic growth in line with the market and the businesses we acquired last year continue to meet or exceed our bottom line growth expectations in aggregate. We continue to be very pleased with the trajectory of the acquired businesses.
 As Mike mentioned, we had a good quarter for healthcare capital equipment, with shipments growing 3% and, at the same time, we closed the quarter with a double-digit growth in backlog. As expected, we saw double-digit growth in capital equipment revenue in the United States.
 In addition, our organic Healthcare Consumables franchise returned to growth, increasing 3% year-over-year. It does not appear to us that we will see a surge of consumables business to cover the softness we experienced in the first quarter but we appear to be back on the growth path we expected. We continue to forecast growth in consumables both sequentially and year-over-year for the full year.
 Life Sciences and Isomedix both had another quarter of good growth and strong margins. Our capital equipment and consumable business in Life Science continues to show strong sales in the pharmaceutical space and Isomedix continues to grow into their recent capacity expansions.
 Looking out to the second half of our fiscal year, we continue to believe that we will deliver top line growth in the range of 8% to 10% for the full year. Our strong backlog gives us a good start on capital equipment shipments and our people in the field indicate that our expectations for consumables and service can be achieved.
 From an earnings perspective, we are pleased to see that the majority of the headwinds we experienced in the first quarter have abated, as expected. However, do mostly to the timing of investments for our in-sourcing projects, we now anticipate that earnings will fall in the lower half of our previously provided range for this fiscal year.
 Let me expand on that a bit. While we have made substantial progress on in-sourcing this year, our original expectations were that costs incurred in the first half of the year would be fully offset by savings in the second half, to get us to a neutral position for the full year. We now anticipate that instead of being neutral, our in-sourcing work will have a net cost of about $3 million to the P&L this fiscal year.
 More specifically, we now anticipate that we will continue to have net expenses in the third quarter and only modest savings in the fourth versus our prior expectations of savings in each quarter. We remain confident that we will achieve or beat the anticipated cost savings in the longer term but we now think that the bulk of the savings will get pushed into fiscal 2015 and 2016.
 An example of the delays we are facing is the challenge of finding enough of the appropriate skilled labor in one of our in-sourcing facilities. We have about 15% of the positions open that we expected to be filled by now. And we cannot in-source additional components until those people are hired and trained.
 Looking longer-term, our early results support our belief that the in-sourcing projects will generate savings of $8 million to $10 million per year and improve the quality and delivery of our products, as we expected. But we now believe we will see the full benefit in fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2015, we anticipate generating between $4 million and $7 million in savings from these projects. Although a little behind our original plans, this is still a great return on the investments we are making and the right strategy for the long term.
 In closing, we are pleased with the sequential improvements in our business and the progress we have made integrating the acquisitions from last year. While we clearly have work to do to deliver on our expectations in the second half of this year and into fiscal 2015, our organization is dedicating to doing so. In particular, we anticipate good growth in the U.S. and Europe and better leverage of our P&L to drive margin improvement.
 With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A. So, Jane, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Konstantin Tcherepachenets with Raymond James. 
Konstantin Tcherepachenets: I guess maybe if we can just start with, can you comment on what are you seeing growth rates from your U.S. Endoscopy business? And also talk kind of what growth are you seeing from the specialty services business that you guys acquired last year? 
Walter Rosebrough: Konstantin, we're not going to give detailed numbers on product lines or segments, as normal, but we anticipated double-digit growth in both of those businesses and we're seeing that, both in revenue and earnings. 
Konstantin Tcherepachenets: Okay, that's terrific. And then the second question is, as a follow up, as you guys think about your M&A strategy and I think, Walt, you have articulated that you kind of -- I think there's a desire to kind of take the specialty service business kind of from regional to a more kind of national business. Can you just provide us an update in terms of rollout of that strategy? And maybe you can just update us on your latest thoughts on M&A? 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. We've said consistently that the place we want to do M&A first is in support of the businesses we already have as opposed to stepping outside and looking for the next, I'll call it expansion, for lack of better terms. And so we clearly are focusing on not just specialty service business, not just the endoscopy business, but we're focusing in all of our businesses, each of our units is looking for opportunities. But just as we had said, and you've articulated, we are interested in making acquisitions in that space to the extent that people are willing to sell. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Erin  Wilson: There seems to be sort of a rebound in organic growth for the consumable services business, I guess compared to what we saw in the first quarter. Can you speak to the underlying trends there? What was related to overall procedure volumes, new products? And how should we think about the quarterly progression going forward? 
Walter Rosebrough: Erin, as we told you last quarter, we were a bit confused ourselves about what was going on last quarter and we thought it was a temporal activity, either stocking up or stocking out, more than any kind of significant change in trend. And now we are -- feel even more firmly that was a case. We had a pretty strong fourth quarter and a pretty strong second quarter and the first quarter seems to -- you just have a temporal fluctuation there. But we did -- as you know, we were in the first quarter, particularly on the consumable side, and our thinking was when we looked out, we didn't see a change in things, significantly, so -- and now we're back to that level. But we're seeing modest growth in market growth in that area. We're not seeing double-digit growth in procedures or those things. We're seeing, I would call it, flat to modest increase growth in the marketplace. And we're trending with that growth rate. 
Erin  Wilson: Okay, great. And now that you're 1 year off on the acquisition of US Endoscopy, are you starting to see some of the revenue synergies materialize? Or how do you -- or do you have any sort of meaningful even just anecdotes as to the synergistic relationship between the 2 businesses and how that is progressing? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, in terms of our expectations with US Endoscopy and with the specialty services business, we are seeing what we expected. That is, the I'll call it the modest, back-office synergies have been realized and we are beginning to see some modest revenue synergies between the businesses. And really there are potential synergies across all 3 businesses, our historic business, the repair business that we acquired and the US Endoscopy business. But to get into any details, it's still -- as we expected, it's still relatively modest and a lot of what we did was buy into a business that we thought had good growth and good new product development and they continue to do that. So they're on their plan. We have seen some modest synergies, cross synergies on the selling side. But it's nothing I would point to specifically. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Just a few questions. First, Walt, the in-sourcing projects, will they be completed by the end of fiscal 2014 or will there be additional projects that you will be looking at going forward? 
Walter Rosebrough: The projects that we have, as I've mentioned before, it's -- we characterize them kind of in 2 or 3 projects but it's really a series of components and parts and projects in multiple plants. It will not be concluded in fiscal 2014 and, in my view, it won't be concluded in '15 or '16 either, but there will be additional projects that we have not counted on or given forecasts on. I would expect those generally to be smaller in nature and kind of add-ons to the things we're currently doing. But I would say, time wise -- I'm not 100% certain on these projects but I would say the preponderance will be done in -- completed the work in fiscal' 15 and we maybe phasing some of that in yet. We will be phasing some of that in '16 as you -- as we're able to build different things -- you don't just convert everything all at once. You take them a part at a time or a product at a time and build those through. So the implementation of that will carry into '15. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. That's helpful. And so the savings numbers you cited earlier, the $8 million to $10 million in, say 2016, that's not necessarily a net figure? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. We would consider that a net figure for those specific projects. If we added projects in the future there would be another set of netting that I can't comment because I do not yet know the cost or the savings. But you can be assured we're not going to do them if we're not -- we may have some investment in the short run but we would not be doing if we're not going to see more significant savings relatively quick. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Right. 
Walter Rosebrough: We see these as very fast returning projects. Inside a couple of years for some of these big projects. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay, thanks. And moving on to international. I know if we look at, say, the mix of revenue, it's down a little in the first half versus what we have seen in the past. Is that something more reflecting of what's going on, for example, in foreign markets? Or does it sort of indicate more a focus towards domestic? 
Walter Rosebrough: No, I would not at all characterize it as us focusing more toward domestic. We continue to believe that the developing countries will be a source of significant revenue for us. And international will be a source of significant revenue. We have seen, in the capital business specifically, our U.S. and EMEA business has been doing what we expected this year. But the business outside U.S. and EMA, which are of course our larger markets, we've seen some softness, both in Asia Pacific and in Latin America. We think that is somewhat market based. Their economies have not been running as rapidly as they were a couple of years ago. So part of that is, I think, general economy in those spaces. But I also think part of it, since we are predominantly U.S., European manufacturers shipping into those markets and particularly the dollar has strengthened versus most of those markets the last 12 to 18 months, we've also seen some pressure based on that. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And finally, on the capital equipment side in the U.S. Are you sort of seeing similar interests as it relates to, say, new build outs or is it more towards renovations? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. That mix for us is generally kind of a 60:40 mix and we haven't seen a radical departure. That maybe a little bit more toward large projects. It's kind of been bouncing around but I'd say, if anything, a little bit toward large projects at this point. But not something that's radically significant. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Greg Halter, Great Lakes Review. 
Gregory Halter: Yes. Couple of questions here. Good morning and congrats on a good results. First one is on the R&D. Mike, you had made some comments about $1 million or so. Can you explain that a little further? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, certainly. We had almost $1 million of foreign R&D government subsidies disallowed. And what that is really based on is the foreign government that we submitted for subsidies for came back and actually believed that the R&D products that we submitted were more engineering-type changes rather than strictly innovation-based in their view. And so they disallowed that subsidy for us. And this is over a couple of year period of time, that subsidy. So going forward, we believe we have limited to no further exposure on this type of disallowance. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. So that $1 million was an increase in the R&D expense, correct? 
Michael Tokich: Correct, yes. So the subsidy had been received and we had to subsequently payback that subsidy that we received. So it increased the R&D expense for the quarter. The easiest way to think about that, it's kind of like a discrete tax adjustment. I mean, that's really the easiest way to think about it. It's just that it doesn't come through on the tax line, it comes through in the R&D line. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. Thank you. And even excluding that, let's say its $12.5 million, I think that's a record for your company in terms of dollar spent. Obviously, as shareholders and so forth, people like to see the return there. I just wonder if you could comment on if you expect that number to remain at that type of level and what kind of products are coming out of the effort? 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. Couple of things, we've already mentioned it, that we're in that kind of 3% range. Two things have occurred in terms of both the raw dollars and the percentages, is US Endoscopy in particular has a significantly higher R&D spend as a percent of their revenue and have a faster turn of new products. And that's what we bought and that's what we want to continue. So part of that is -- and it's absolutely natural in that business and the business they're in and we expect that to continue. So that's shifted the percentages up a little bit. And we do -- we have increased R&D spend and we've done a lot the last several years to refresh our line and we have a number of new products coming out in the future. We don't comment on what's coming but we have introduced, fairly recently, a new set of steam sterilizers. We have worked on a number of our other products, which we see coming out the next 6 to 18 months. So we have picked up R&D spend a little bit in the base -- on a percentage basis. The balance of the percentage increase is really -- I'll call it a mix shift to US Endoscopy. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And we've covered the company since, I think, February of 1994. So it's a long time. And I can recall back 8 to 10 years that the Life Science business was something that I think there were even some divestitures in and you were trying to get out of that in some respects. And I just wondered what has changed to give you such a high profit margin now? I know the 24% you said is all-time high and the mix is favorable and so forth. But wonder whether or not -- first, what has changed there? And whether or not that's sustainable in your view? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, I would break it -- there's multiple things that have happened over the course of that timeframe but I would break it into 2 or 3 things specifically. The first is, and we've talked about this maybe 5 years ago, when we were having most of the conversation, is we were doing a lot -- the Life Science business is not as standard, in general, as the healthcare business. That is, every sterilizer might have some slightly different modification because you're putting it into the assembly line or the line of the company -- of the pharmaceutical company or it's a very heavily used item. So they want it engineered specifically for their purpose. Some of these things are the size of our room. And so it was a very heavily engineered business and we were not doing a good job of capturing the engineering. We were doing a good job of capturing the cost, if you will, but of the design and changes and engineering, we were not doing a good job of that 4, 5, 6 years ago. And as a result, we were under-pricing our products. We have a stopped doing that and so we now price appropriately for the work that we do for the specialty-built items, these large, specialty-built items. So that's one thing that we have done. The second thing we've done is we have quit chasing business that is pure, low-end business. And the third thing we've done is we've improved -- now I'm talking on the capital side, we've improved our plants significantly. Now most of those plants are shared with the healthcare business and so it is the healthcare business is the predominant or the large user of those factories. But as we've improved those factories and you've seen results from those factories in the healthcare business, too, but that drops through very quickly on the Life Science side. And then the second major -- other major area is on the Chemistry side. We have increased our chemistries -- the mix of our product has moved toward chemistries and, to some extent, service but certainly on the Chemistry side. And the Chemistry side is a more profitable business. So we've had a mix shift over those 4 or 5 years. We do believe that, if you look at our -- don't look at this quarter but you look at the year, we believe those are sustainable kind of numbers. You look at the quarter, we had heck of a nice quarter. We had very heavy positive mix, if you will. But yes, we do think that those kind of numbers are sustainable and we've been investing in that business and continue to invest to grow that business as opposed to, you are correct, 6, 7, 8 years ago, there were a lot of people suggesting we might want to think about exiting the business. We don't think that's appropriate. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. Well, not now, that's for sure. Keep it up. 
Walter Rosebrough: We didn't think so 6 years ago. We feel much more strongly about it today. 
Gregory Halter: And do you expect any changes in your tax rate going forward, around this 35% level? I know it bounces around quarter-over-quarter but generally? 
Michael Tokich: Yes. I mean, Greg, we've been in the range, 34% to 35%, which is what we think for the year will remain in our forecast. Now longer term, obviously, the more international growth we can get the more profitable we can get outside of the United States. Obviously there are possibilities to reduce that. But right now, for this fiscal year, 34% to 35% is where we're forecasting. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And any update on the share repurchase program of the company? 
Michael Tokich: Yes. During the quarter, we actually bought a little bit of shares. We bought just over 321,000 shares for a total of about just under $14 million. And then for the year, we've got about 427,000 shares for about $18.5 million. So we still have about $93 million left on our authorization. But again, we are just buying a little bit at a time here. Again, our preference would be to invest in our business or do M&A rather than continue with a larger share repurchase. 
Walter Rosebrough: Right now, we're buying shares in effect to offset dilution from the company's stock-and-option program. So at a high level, that's kind of what our thought is, as long as we see the M&A and -- investments in the business and M&A, which we think dominate that third option. 
Gregory Halter: All right. And on the in-sourcing, you've indicted some issues with skilled labor and so forth. Is that things like welders or how would you characterize that? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. You're exactly right. It's machinists, welders, skilled manufacturing people. Not assembly labor, that's very easy to come by. But skilled workers, like machinists of various types and welders of various types. That's correct. 
Gregory Halter: All right. And one last one... 
Walter Rosebrough: And we don't see that being a -- this isn't a 10-year -- it's a 10-year problem for the country. We don't think it's a 10-year problem for us. We think we will work our way through that. It's just taking a little longer than we thought. 
Gregory Halter: You got Lincoln right down the street. You need to call on them. 
Walter Rosebrough: They are good friends of ours. 
Gregory Halter: Last one is... 
Walter Rosebrough: Actually, they're probably better -- they probably think of us better because we're the customer, right? 
Gregory Halter: One last one for you. Any changes in competition that you'd like to note? 
Walter Rosebrough: I can't think of any significant change that we would note. 
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back now for closing remarks. 
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for joining us and have a great day. 
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q1  (2013-08-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. Welcome to the STERIS Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I’d now like to introduce today’s host, Julie Winter, Director of Investor Relations. Ma’am, you may begin.

 With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is again my pleasure to be here with you this morning to review our first quarter financial results. Following my remarks, as usual, Walt will provide further perspective on the quarter. My comments this morning will focus on our adjusted first quarter results.
 However, before I start reviewing our first quarter results, I would like to remind you that our adjusted net income this quarter excludes a $9 million tax benefit associated with a deduction for U.S. tax purposes related to our European restructuring effort. This deduction is based upon the IRS completing its fiscal 2012 tax year audit. Our adjusted net income also excludes just over $3 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs. Please see the reconciliation table included within our press release for additional details.
 Let me now begin with a review of our first quarter income statement. Total company revenue grew 9% during the first quarter, driven by a 13% increase from acquisitions and a 1% improvement in pricing, offset by flat organic volume and a 4% decline from our SYSTEM 1 and 1E franchise. Foreign currency was neutral to revenue during the quarter. Gross margin in the quarter declined 80 basis points to 39.9%. The positive gross margin impact from our acquisitions of approximately 110 basis points was more than offset by an approximate 90 basis point decline from our investments in in-sourcing and the negative impact on gross margins from the decline in SYSTEM 1E revenue. In addition, we incurred approximately $2 million from the Medical Device Excise Tax and had unfavorable mix in our organic business during the quarter.
 EBIT for the quarter declined $3.1 million to $46.1 million. EBIT as a percent of revenue for the quarter was 12.5%, a decline of 210 basis points from last year due to the gross margin impact I have just described as well as increased spending on research and development and a $2.2 million negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates as the dollar weakened compared to both the euro and peso.
 The effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.7% compared with 33.5% last year due to the timing of discrete item adjustments in both quarters. We expect to return to a more normalized tax rate, included in our guidance, over the course of the year. As a result, net income was $26.2 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared with $30.9 million or $0.53 per diluted share last year. The $0.09 per diluted share variance is driven by a $0.04 impact from lower operating income, a $0.02 impact from higher interest expense, a $0.02 impact from a higher tax rate and a $0.01 impact from an increase in diluted shares.
 Moving on to our segment results, Healthcare revenue in the quarter grew 13%. Contributing to the quarter, our acquisitions drove both consumables and service revenue up 40% and 34%, respectively. Capital equipment revenue, excluding the negative impact of our year-over-year SYSTEM 1E unit shipments, declined 1%. Including the SYSTEM 1 unit shipments last year, capital equipment revenues declined 11%. We believe the decline in capital equipment revenue is a matter of timing, not changes to market conditions, as our Healthcare backlog in the quarter increased by 21% to $120.2 million. Healthcare adjusted operating profit was $19.7 million in the quarter. Several factors which I already discussed are impacting Healthcare’s operating margin, including the Medical Device Excise Tax, increased spending on research and development, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the timing of insourcing investments and unfavorable organic mix.
 Life Sciences revenue declined 1% in the quarter. Consumable revenue had another good quarter of growth, up 8%, but was more than offset by declines in both capital equipment and service revenue of 7% and 2%, respectively. Backlog in Life Sciences ended the quarter at $44.6 million, a decline of 6% compared with the prior year, but remains at a level consistent with our historic backlog rates. Life Sciences operating margin increased 130 basis points to 20.9%, driven by improved gross margins mainly due to favorable mix and continued operating leverage. Revenue for Isomedix increased 5% in the quarter to $48.2 million. Isomedix operating margin was 30.5% of revenue, a decline from their very strong first quarter last year, but a nice improvement sequentially as we continue to fill our recently expanded capacity.
 In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $165.8 million of cash and $513.7 million in long-term debt. We remain comfortable with our current leverage profile of total debt to capital of 34.6% and total debt to EBITDA of 1.8x. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $11 million compared with $45.7 million in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow, which we anticipated, is due in part to the payments of our annual incentive compensation program, which did not occur last year, as well as the impact of strong working capital improvements in the prior year. Our full year free cash flow outlook remains unchanged at approximately $145 million. Capital spending was $21.7 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $18.3 million.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter Rosebrough: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us this morning. Now that you have heard an overview of our results from Mike, I will spend my time focused on our profitability for the quarter and our thoughts on the rest of the year. First of all, we believe that our first quarter results are largely a matter of timing versus a change in underlying demand or sustainability of profitability. In particular, we continue to see generally stable market trends, good performance from the businesses we’ve recently acquired and solid Healthcare orders and backlog. These trends give us confidence in our ability to deliver revenue and earnings in line with our annual guidance.
 With that said, let me quickly cover a few highlights. Our overall revenue growth of 9% was driven primarily by strength in Isomedix and the businesses we acquired last year. While Life Science revenue declined slightly, they delivered another quarter of impressive margin expansion, and we believe Life Science will finish the year in line with our expectations.
 As we approach the anniversaries of the acquisitions we made last year, we are pleased with both the performance of the businesses and the progress we have made from an integration perspective. Of particular note, U.S. Endoscopy has continued its strong track record of growth with new products, specifically, products like the Raptor grasping device, the Infinity biliary sampling device, AquaShield CO2 and the Oracle EUS latex-free balloon, and we are leveraging our existing customer relationships to expand our specialty services businesses as well.
 As we told you at the beginning of the year, we anticipated that our earnings for fiscal ’14 would be more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year than usual. This was primarily due to the timing of R&D spending, as well as the timing of startup costs for our insourcing investments versus the savings that will be generated later.
 In addition to those expectations, we have experienced a timing issue with shipments in the Healthcare segment in our first quarter. The combination of those events led to a lighter-than-anticipated quarter, but we anticipate these trends to reverse. Let me expand a bit on that. First, this is the last quarter we have a comparison issue with SYSTEM 1E, which continued to reduce our reported growth in Healthcare capital equipment during the quarter.
 As you heard from Mike, excluding SYSTEM 1E, our Healthcare capital equipment revenue was nearly flat. Though we expected to see growth in capital equipment shipments, excluding S1E, our order rate remains strong and our backlog grew by 21%, which gives us confidence that it was a matter of shipment timing. The other challenge with Healthcare gross margin percentage this quarter was the product mix of our revenue, which offset the margin percentage gains from our recent acquisitions.
 We had 2 issues from a mix perspective. First, our organic consumables business was lower as a percentage of our overall revenue. In addition, we had a mix issue with our -- within our capital equipment shipments. As happens from time to time in capital business, we ship more of our lower-margin capital equipment in the quarter than our higher-margin equipment. However, when we look at our backlog in Healthcare, we see a better mix of higher-margin capital equipment going forward.
 When we look at the rest of our decline in profit, we had 3 additional headwinds that all hit in the quarter, most of which we believe will be eliminated by the end of the year. Those headwinds include: first, our insourcing investments, which we believe will reverse and actually generate savings towards the end of the year with negligible total full year impact; we had negative foreign exchange, as Mike mentioned, which, at foreign exchange rates at the end of June, are anticipated to reverse in the second half and becomes slightly positive for the year; and the Medical Device Excise Tax, which anniversaries in the fourth quarter.
 In addition, we planned higher levels of R&D spending this year, which we saw in the quarter. While we anticipate some easing of that spending on a percentage basis, we will maintain closer to 3% of revenue throughout this fiscal year, as we had planned. We are excited about the private development projects currently underway, and we look forward to sharing more information with you once we are ready to launch those products.
 While each of the items creating year-over-year variances that I just mentioned is fairly small in and of itself, combined together, they had a meaningful impact on our profit in the quarter. To assist in your modeling, however, I will mention that over 1/2 of the difference between consensus and our EPS results was planned, and the balance is more than explained by the unexpected uptick in tax rate, FX exchange rates, lower-than-expected shipments and mix. As I’ve already noted, we believe we will make much of that up in the second half and are naturally working to achieve our original plan. As you all know, we manage this business for the long term and are willing to invest to produce long-term earnings growth. We do not want to overreact to short-term blips in our performance as long as we believe that the investments will pay off and that we will overcome any headwinds in a relatively short time, and we believe we will.
 Looking out at the rest of our fiscal year, then, we continue to believe that we will deliver top line growth in the range of 8% to 10% and earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.47 to $2.60. We continue to be encouraged by the reception of our new products, like V-PRO maX, the iQ 3600 Integration System, the award-winning European XLED light, new lines of steam sterilizers and washers and a new orthopedic surgical t
 table. We have a good pipeline of product development projects behind these. While we anticipate sequential improvements in margin in each quarter, we expect the most significant improvement in Q4. As for the longer term, we believe the investments we are making now will contribute to our goal of double-digit profit growth going forward. Reflecting that, our Board has approved a 10% increase in our dividend from $0.19 to $0.21 per quarter.
 With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to begin Q&A. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. We are now ready to begin the Q&A. So Jill, would you please give the instructions and we’ll get started? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James. 
Konstantin Tcherepachenets: This is actually Konstantin for Larry. So I guess I just want -- Walt, I just wanted to understand. So clearly, it sounds like about 1/2 of the difference in the EPS miss relative to the street is just the street getting the gating wrong? But can you talk about the other, the essentially the other $0.06 difference? How much of it was really just kind of I guess really kind of a surprise essentially in the quarter, and can you just explain really in maybe more detail what drove it? 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. Yes, you are correct in your original assumption that -- actually, it’s a little over 1/2 that was a difference between where we were thinking we would be in the quarter and where the street was. And as you know, we don’t give quarterly guidance. So that’s not completely unexpected. We are usually closer than that together, but this time, we were a little further apart. But on the differences, I would say, almost by definition, all of the differences versus our plan, which is a little less than 1/2 of the $0.12, almost all of the differences are unexpected. That is, FX does what it does. We didn’t expect it. The tax rate, the IRS and we determine things at a time. And when they come -- we never know exactly when they are going to come. And so it was unexpected vis-à-vis the quarter. For the year, we think it levels out. And then the balance is really the shipments and mix, and that was unexpected when we set our plan, so -- but the flipside of that is our backlog grew $20 million, and that was unexpected too. So that’s why we have confidence that, that reverses. 
Konstantin Tcherepachenets: Yes, okay. That makes sense. And then just on your commentary regarding that the consumables, I guess, the growth of the consumables was lower this quarter than you expected. Can you just -- maybe just provide more color on that? Is that just driven by lower healthcare utilization? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. In any short-term period, that’s always a difficult question to answer, because the hospitals use things and then they choose to stock up and not stock up and all that. So we see some variation due to the way they choose to order. And that sometimes lags or leads their usage. So it’s a little difficult to answer, but we clearly -- as most people have said, the rates in hospitals slowed down a bit, actually particularly in the fourth quarter of last year, as I recall. We've seen it a little stronger than that. And so it could just be a temporal thing. Right now, we are not concerned about the overall direction of that business. 
Operator: Our next question is from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Erin  Wilson: Did you quantify the consumables organic growth, I mean, I guess x U.S. Endoscopy? And can you explain a little bit about, I guess, was it a less profitable mix there? And then can you also explain the capital equipment trends, fundamentally speaking, in the industry and why there was the, I guess, shipment mismatch? 
Michael Tokich: Erin, it's Mike. We had minus 4% in our organic consumables business reflected within Healthcare. I don’t know, Walt, you want to... 
Walter Rosebrough: There were 3 other questions. I got the first one and the last one. There are 2 other questions, I think. The last one, Erin, in terms of capital, we are seeing nothing different than we have been saying now for probably close to a year, 6 or 9 months anyway, close to a year. That is, we are not seeing extraordinary increases in capital spending in North America, nor we are seeing decreases. They are running at what I would call solid rates, steady state to slightly up. And that’s reflected in our order patterns over this last 6, 8, 12 months, and so it’s strictly a matter of when the timing of shipments.
 And what we have seen again, and this fluctuates a little bit, we have seen a little bit more increase in large projects as opposed to replacement work in that, and so those large projects are defined shipment dates usually out -- almost always out further than replacement work. So we just have some projects, some larger projects that are sitting out a quarter or 2 as compared to where we were a quarter ago, and that’s how the backlog tends to grow because the order patterns are up, and they are up sequentially, but they are not up nearly as much as the backlog reflects. And Erin, I am sorry. I missed the middle question, I think. 
Erin  Wilson: I was just talking about sort of the mixes, the consumables business? 
Walter Rosebrough: Inside the consumables, there is not significant mix issue. It’s really the mix of consumables versus -- and really, if you look at it, we traded a little bit, the mix of consumables versus the mix of service. Our service business grew nicely, and it has a little lower profitability than our consumables business. And again, we don’t think either one of those is some change of trend. It’s just, in a quarter, those things happen. 
Erin  Wilson: Okay, got it. And on the U.S. Endoscopy deal, where do you stand as far as the cross-selling or potential synergies there? Are they starting to materialize? 
Walter Rosebrough: The primary reason, of course, we bought U.S. Endoscopy was because it was an area that we wanted to get into and we wanted to have a channel into that business. And they gave us channel and product. We clearly have that, and so we are seeing that. We are seeing modest synergies, but those are the kinds of synergies we expected to see. The more important thing is we are continuing to see solid growth and solid product development cycles. And so they are doing very well vis-à-vis what our expectations were and what our plan is for them. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Goldman. 
Robert Goldman: First, I just wanted to follow-up on an answer you just gave. Mike, you had mentioned the organic consumable sales were down 4%. Does organic... 
Michael Tokich: Healthcare and, specifically, organic. 
Robert Goldman: In Healthcare. 
Michael Tokich: Yes. 
Robert Goldman: Does organic mean you've stripped out U.S. Endoscopy from that calculation? 
Michael Tokich: That is correct, yes. So it’s just -- it’s the rest of our Healthcare business less the acquisitions and less SYSTEM 1E impact. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. Now I could understand timing issues on CapEx. I have got a more difficult time understanding why a 4% decline in the organic consumable business doesn’t represent some change in the marketplace or in your sales. Could you take us through that? 
Michael Tokich: Bob, we do see variation. And for example, last year, if you look through the year, we had 3 quarters that looked kind of similar and 1 quarter that had an off-tick. And we've -- and then it went back up, and we've -- if you go back year-over-year, every year, we see that. We don’t see -- the reason I suggest it is we don’t see any fundamental cause for that. And sometimes there is timing. We go both through distributors and we go -- and hospitals make decisions about when they buy, so sometimes we see blips in timing. At this point in time, that’s our view. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. On cash flow, there is the obvious ramp-up in capital expenditures. Two questions on that. One, could you just remind us again what the ramp up is for, and how you see that helping Steris? In other words, is it cost savings from whatever you are doing on the CapEx side? And then also, as we look past fiscal ’14, where does CapEx start to fall down to? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, let’s talk 2 things. The first is, the most significant variation or difference quarter -- year-over-year in cash flow was the management incentive program, not capital spending, and that’s because we didn’t pay one the year before because, as you know, 2 years ago our performance wasn’t what we expected. So that’s the biggest variation when you're looking different -- differentials. Now in terms of capital spending, we have picked up our capital spending. You have to remember, there is multiple reasons for capital spending. The first is Isomedix, and as we have said, we have continued to grow our capacity in Isomedix. And capacity is a twofold equation. It is the physical facilities as well as the cobalt [ph] that we purchase. And we expect to see that continuing to grow modestly as we continue to grow the business, and so that we will continue to see in line with growth of the business. So that’s one section.
 The other significant area, as you mentioned, is that we are investing in our plans to do more insourcing of products that we are making, and that is -- there is twofold. One is, some of those are literally insourcing of a product itself that is someone else's that was manufacturing for us historically and now we are going to manufacture ourself, and the other is components of products. And we are doing both. And as we mentioned, we were spending about $20 million over the course of a couple of years, and we were getting significant annual savings for doing that.
 This year, the front end of that -- and it's not just capital costs, Bob, because you see that in increased depreciation, of course, but you also see the project expense that we are going through and the changeover from when you switched from a vendor from Part A to Part B. There's changeover costs. There's a number of things that we are incurring in those expenses. We’re incurring the bulk of those expenses in the first half of this year, and we experience good returns in the back half of the year from doing that and then -- but more importantly, out in the future years, we expect to see $8 million to $10 million of profit improvement as a result of that or cost reduction as a result of that. I think we've said about $8 million you should expect next year, and then the other couple of million dribble out the following year. 
Robert Goldman: Great. And then just 2 other number things, if I can. First, again on CapEx, should we assume this $90 million rate for 2014 that you project, is that sort of where CapEx will be for the next several years? 
Michael Tokich: Bob, that’s a tough call. Plus or minus $10 million or $15 million, I would say yes. Plus or minus $2 million, I don’t know. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. And then the final question is, obviously, one way to avoid gaps between the analysts and your own internal projections on earnings is to give us a bit more, to the extent you can, guidance on the gating. Would you be comfortable to give us some sense of what the second half earnings might be as a percent of the total year or something like that to get us all a little better in line with what you guys are thinking? 
Walter Rosebrough: Bob, at this point, doing half and half is equivalent of doing quarterly guidance for the next quarter, but I understand your view and, as I've said, we clearly -- historically, we’ve done, I think, a pretty good job of matching up. This quarter, we did not match up very well, and that’s our responsibility. I should have been clearer in my communication with you all. But on that, we've said in our statements that the bulk of what we missed in the first quarter we expect to make up in the second half. And that’s not something we would expect. Generally speaking, we are not going to pick it up in the second quarter. So that’s one guidepost I can give you, and the other is we gave a 42-58 split at the end of the year -- or last year -- or at the beginning of this year, excuse me. At the beginning of this year, we gave a 42-58 split because we knew we were going to be investing more into the first half and getting the benefit of that in the second half. We would be slightly under that today if we were reguiding. I don’t think we will give a number there because, again, that -- you get too many coordinates and I'm giving quarterly guidance, but we are not going to make that $5 million up this year, so plus or minus and so -- excuse me, we are not going to make the differential, which is slightly under $6 million, up in this coming half. As a result, this coming half is going to be lighter than the 42-58 that we gave you earlier. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes Review. 
Jason Rodgers: I wonder if you could provide some detail on the insourcing spending, what the amount was this quarter and what do you expect it to be for the next few quarters? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, right now, Jason, what we’ve just outlined before is that the combination of insourcing and 1E decline was about 90 basis points impact on gross margin. Obviously, we anticipate, as Walt said earlier, that will continue through the first half. So we’ll probably spend some of that again in Q2 and then, obviously, start generating savings throughout the remainder of the year, most likely the bulk of that in the fourth quarter also. So you can anticipate some additional spending next quarter and then some savings in third quarter, but most of the savings generated to become neutral for the year in the fourth quarter. 
Jason Rodgers: And then looking at the tax rate, what do you expect it to be for the remainder of the fiscal year? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, we still think, even though we had some discrete item adjustments this quarter, which were unfavorable, we still think and anticipate the range in 34% to 35%, as is in our guidance. 
Jason Rodgers: And finally, did you mention that you expect FX to be neutral on your results in the second quarter? 
Michael Tokich: On that, the way we handle FX in our forecast is we are not foreign exchange forecasters, so we literally take the forward rates at the end of the quarter and apply them to our forecasts. And if you do that, taking the forward rates as of the end of June, it actually does reverse and come slightly positive, so it turns from the negative that you saw in this quarter to slightly positive. 
Jason Rodgers: That’s slightly positive for the second quarter? 
Michael Tokich: No, for the year. 
Walter Rosebrough: No, for the full year. 
Michael Tokich: So it’s positive -- it overcomes what we lost, again, if those rates stay the same. Now your forecast of U.S. dollar versus all of these currencies, if it's any better than the forward rates, use that one. We don’t try to do that. 
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Cooley with Stephens Incorporated. 
Christopher Cooley: Could we start off -- I just want to go back to Healthcare, and specifically the operating margin there. Could you talk a little bit more about the product mix? I understand the Med Device Excise Tax, but that kind of increase in R&D spend, you talked about FX and insourcing all weighing on that, but I really want to drill down on mix, kind of what you saw in terms of the quarter versus maybe what we’ve seen historically and are there any changes off of that mix that you sold in during the quarter as we think about consumable sales going forward? And I've got a couple of follow-ups. 
Walter Rosebrough: Chris, we saw mix -- as we mentioned, the consumables are a little off, and we think that's a temporal issue. And that -- so there wasn’t mix within consumables. So it’s not that issue, it's just the fact that there was less consumables, which [indiscernible]... 
Christopher Cooley: I’m sorry, I meant the mix on working capital. 
Walter Rosebrough: Where there was a mix within products was in the capital side, and on the capital side, again, it just so happened that what we shift were our relatively lower-margin products and then -- and less of our higher-margin, more of our lower-margin. When we look at our backlog going forward, that goes back to our normal trend, so we don’t believe that this is a trend. It just is a one-off issue. 
Christopher Cooley: And I guess just as a follow-up to that, then, when we think about historical operating margin in -- for the Healthcare segment, last several years have been kind of the 14-ish, low 14s. You're starting off out of the gate a little bit low here. How do we think about profitability for the full year within Healthcare from an operating margin perspective? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, Chris, we are still targeting a total company adjusted EBIT of about 15.5%, and that obviously means that Healthcare has to come back over the next couple of quarters. And we believe it will. Again, it's more timing, but most of that impact from where we are today has to come from Healthcare in order to get us there. 
Walter Rosebrough: And I would add, Chris, all of these items that we talked about, being the investments in the insourcing, the investments that we are making in R&D, these are virtually all Healthcare-related, or certainly the preponderance of the money there is Healthcare-related. And as a result, the savings from those will be Healthcare-related. So, that’s why we believe that we will see the Healthcare profitability move back. 
Christopher Cooley: Makes sense. I just -- 2 quick follow-ups, if I may, and then I will get back in queue. When you provided guidance at the fiscal year end coming into this year, you talked about organic growth contributing 4% to 5% from a volume standpoint on the year for the full year. In the first quarter, clearly, we had flat was -- I am just trying to gauge your expectations versus where we are on the street. For the quarter, were you anticipating more of an organic contribution to growth in the most recent quarter? 
Walter Rosebrough: Two -- I am going to answer it. I think you separated -- I'm going to separate 2 questions, I think, Chris. The first is, for the year, we don’t feel any differently today than we felt 90 days ago in terms of organic growth. And for the quarter, it was indeed unexpected that the quarter in Healthcare came in a bit lighter than our expectation, which we -- actually, we talked about that when we were talking about versus expectations. So we were a little light versus our expectations. 
Christopher Cooley: Understood. And then just last question and I’ll get back in queue. 
Walter Rosebrough: And then almost all of that is contained in the backlog. That’s where the -- that’s one of the reasons the backlog grew. Our orders didn’t change versus our expectations... 
Christopher Cooley: Just the backlog? 
Walter Rosebrough: Our shipments did. 
Christopher Cooley: Makes perfect sense. And then just lastly, on leverage. I believe -- you talked about last year as a pivot year, this year kind of coming back around and focusing on growth. You weren’t really anticipating a lot of leverage to the operating line this year as we started the year. Any change in that view after you've looked at the 1Q and kind of what you are seeing going forward, or still kind of a relatively neutral operating leverage kind of viewpoint as we think about this year before? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, Chris, I would say that we -- our anticipation is the same. It was at 50 or 60 basis points, we would have no change in that. Again, Q1 is one quarter. We still have the bulk of the year ahead of us. So I think we would still maintain that 50 to 60 basis point improvement from an EBIT margin standpoint. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Mitra Ramgopal. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Just a couple of questions. First, on the acquisition front, you’re clearly seeing some nice growth there. I was wondering, as you look at margins, however, if there is room in terms of any cost savings or synergies that have not yet been realized that might be apparent later in the year? 
Walter Rosebrough: The bulk of those, there is -- there will be reduction in expense in those because of the money we’re spending to do the integration, but we adjust that out. So when you look at adjusted earnings, we don’t see tremendous changes in operating margins for that reason. We've pretty much done what we’re going to do. Now over time, like all of our businesses, we look for ways to improve. So they will be looking for ways to improve, just as they have in the past and we will in the future, but I don’t see a step function for that reason. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. And again, I believe, as you mentioned, the 3 acquisitions have pretty much have been largely integrated. I don't know if you could comment on a potential pipeline for future acquisitions, and if it relates to the 8% to 10% guidance revenue growth, if that’s assuming any transactions? 
Walter Rosebrough: The first answer to your question is we do have a robust pipeline. Going forward, we’re looking at a number of things, as we’ve talked about before. First of all, we’re not going to comment on what -- obviously, prior to the time when we would make an announcement. But secondly, the timing of those is often far more dependent on the seller than the buyer, so we don’t have a lot of control of timing. So that’s the answer to your first question. And actually, we are excited about the things we’re looking at. In the end, it comes down to price and how we feel and how they feel. But we like what we are seeing in the marketplace. The second question is -- or answer to your second question is we did not include anything for acquisitions other than those that we’ve already announced in our forecast or plans. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And then as a quick follow-up, as it relates to the capital spending environment, I believe you said things have been pretty stable in the U.S. Any comments in terms of what you’re seeing outside of the U.S.? 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. Outside the U.S., I would break it into roughly 2 camps. Latin America and Europe, we are seeing maybe a little bit of sunshine. Those have been -- particularly Europe has been very difficult. I would say that it's certainly not robust, but it seems like there is a little bit of thawing in Europe. In Latin America, we've had good solid performance there for a long time and we think we’ll continue to see that good solid performance, although it’s not the -- I'll call it maybe the market itself is not the robust growth that it has been. And in Asia-Pacific, we are clearly seeing more pressure as you see those economies slowdown. 
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back for any closing remarks. 
Julie Winter: Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. This concludes our conference call, and we’ll chat with you again next quarter. 
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q4  (2013-05-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the STERIS' fiscal 2013 fourth quarter conference call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce today's host, Julie Winter, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and full year conference call.

 With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time this morning to join us. As usual, I want to point out that we had several items impacting our reported results, all of which are excluded from our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
 As you saw in our earnings announcement, during the quarter, we made a pretax adjustment of $3.1 million to our SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program and class action settlement. By making this adjustment, we have essentially finalized both of these programs as the remaining liability is immaterial.
 In addition, we have expenses related to our acquisitions impacting the P&L. During the quarter, we recorded pretax expenses of $5.2 million for intangible amortization and $650,000 for acquisition and integration expenses, which were somewhat offset by $2.5 million gain for the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration. Please see our earnings release for full reconciliation of as reported to adjusted earnings.
 Turning to our adjusted consolidated results, total revenue increased 14% during the fourth quarter, driven by an 11% increase from acquisitions, 5% organic volume and 1% pricing improvement, somewhat offset by a 3% decline in our U.S. SYSTEM 1 and 1E business. Currency fluctuations were revenue neutral during the quarter.
 Gross margin in the quarter increased to 120 basis points to 41.2%. The improvement in gross margin was positively impacted by the acquisitions and favorable product mix, but was negatively impacted by the medical device excise tax, which reduced gross margin by over $2 million or about 50 basis points.
 Adjusted EBIT for the quarter increased 9% to $65.4 million. Adjusted EBIT as a percent of revenue for the quarter was 15.3%, a decline of 70 basis points. The positive impact of acquisitions and product mix were more than offset by the medical device excise tax and over a 200 basis point decline resulting from our annual incentive compensation program. Recall that last year we did not pay any bonuses as part of our annual incentive compensation program.
 The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.3% compared with 38.2% last year. The lower effective tax rate resulted from favorable discrete item adjustments, including the settlement of prior-year tax audits, the recording of the federal R&D tax credit and other discrete item adjustments. Adjusted net income for the quarter increased 18% to $41.5 million or $0.70 per diluted share as compared to $35.1 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the prior year.
 Moving on to our segment results. Healthcare revenue in the quarter increased 16%. Contributing to the quarter, consumable revenue grew 42%, service revenue grew 29%, and capital equipment, excluding SYSTEM 1E unit sales increased 8% with growth in both infection prevention and surgical products.
 Capital equipment was flat, including SYSTEM 1E unit, due to the replacement program for SYSTEM 1 units in the prior year. Healthcare backlog at the end of the year, excluding SYSTEM 1E units was $104.6 million, an increase of 15% with strength across the business.
 Healthcare operating income was $42.9 million or 13.6% of revenue compared with $39.1 million or 14.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the negative impact from both the annual incentive compensation program expense as well as the medical device excise tax, Healthcare operating margin would have expanded by over 150 basis points.
 Life Sciences revenue increased 9% in the quarter. Capital equipment revenue grew 13%, consumable revenue grew 6% and service revenue grew 8%. Volume growth in capital equipment continues to stand primarily from pharma customers, who have resumed spending on replacement capital equipment.
 Life Sciences operating income was $12.3 million or 19.1% of revenue, representing an increase of 13% compared with the prior year, driven primarily by the increase in volume. Backlog in Life Sciences was $48.4 million at the end of the quarter in line with prior years.
 Revenue for Isomedix increased 7% in the quarter. We continue to experience solid demand from our core medical device customers as well as a positive impact from our acquisition of Biotest, which closed March of calendar 2012. Isomedix operating margin fell slightly in the quarter to 26.4% of revenue, as the increased volume was not enough to offset the margin impact of our recently expanded capacity.
 In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $142 million of cash. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $492.3 million and consists of $410 million from our private placements and $82.3 million from our revolving credit facility. Our total debt-to-capital ratio is 34.3% and our total net debt-to-capital ratio is 27%.
 Our free cash flow, excluding the SYSTEM 1 Rebate program and class action settlement for fiscal 2013 was $158 million compared with $108.3 million in the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow is attributable to improvements in working capital management and an $18 million cash benefit associated with the deduction for U.S. tax purposes related to our European restructuring effort, which I discussed last quarter.
 Our inventory levels had been reduced by over 8% as compared to the prior year, even with the growth in the business and inventory added from the recent acquisitions. In addition, our DSO now at 68 days has improved by 6 days compared to the prior year.
 Capital spending was $23.5 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $20.5 million. Total capital spending for the year came in at $87.4 million, slightly less than we had anticipated. For fiscal 2014, our outlook for capital spending is approximately $90 million.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to spend with us this morning. As you've already heard from Mike, we had a strong finish for fiscal 2013. I will focus my comments on highlights of the year and then turn to our outlook for fiscal '14, and then we'll open for Q&A.
 We entered this past year with anticipation and would be a pivot year for STERIS, with growth rates limited by our challenging comparisons due to the strong capital sales of SYSTEM 1E last year. STERIS people exceeded our expectations for the year, growing revenue 6%, completing 4 acquisitions, providing record earnings per share and making significant working capital improvements.
 Each business segment contributed to our topline growth. Healthcare revenue grew 6% in total or 4% organically, excluding the impact of SYSTEM 1. Healthcare organic growth stem from solid performance across the business with improvement continuing to come from our newer products, V-PRO maX, Vision washers, Prolystica cleaning chemistries and new integrated OR products.
 We are focused on introducing products that increase efficiencies for our customers, and in fact recently launched several new products. Those includes the iQ 3600 OR integration system, a new line of steam sterilizers, CS iQ, the AMSCO 2500 washer and innovative orthopedic surgical table, and an ultraviolet surface disinfection system.
 As with most companies, our European business in both Healthcare and Life Science segment was challenged during the year by difficult market conditions, particularly in Southern Europe. However, our European Healthcare team was able to offset revenue declines with cost savings, so we did not see profit degradation. We expect continued growth challenges in that region in the coming year, but remain cautiously optimistic for the longer run.
 The Life Science team had an outstanding year, exceeding our expectations by growing revenue 8% and expanding profit by 14%. They produced double-digit increases in capital equipment and solid mid-single digit growth in both consumables and service. Their profitability improved with this increase in volume and with favorable product mix.
 And finally, the people of Isomedix delivered 9% revenue growth in fiscal 2013, with 6% organic growth and the rest from our acquisition of Biotest in March 2012. As we've discussed all year, we have expanded capacity in Isomedix and that has had a near-term impact on our margins, as we feel the new capacity. But even with those expansions, Isomedix increased profit by over 8% year-over-year.
 Turning to STERIS total profitability. Our EBIT margin for the year came in as we anticipated at just under 15%, a slight decline from the previous year. This was due mainly to the cost of our annual incentive compensation program that Mike mentioned earlier and the negative impact of the medical device tax.
 Adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 5% to $2.34, which was above our expectation and included the impact of one quarter of the medical device tax. One of the key drivers of going-forward margin improvement is our continuing effort to create a lean business, which is beginning to benefit us.
 One of the opportunities resulting from that effort is insourcing. As you all know, we have major projects underway to insource component production that is currently provided by third parties. These projects are progressing well and the first one is beginning to pay off.
 We spent about $15 million in capital during fiscal 2013 on these projects, and we anticipate spending another $5 million to $10 million more in fiscal 2014. While we are beginning to see cost savings from the first of these initiatives, we are also experiencing the startup cost and depreciation from the others. We do not anticipate that we will see either meaningful savings or significant increased cost in aggregate from these projects in fiscal 2014.
 The savings from the first projects are offset by startup cost from the following work. Beginning in fiscal 2015 and beyond, we anticipate saving $8 million to $10 million per year as a result of these efforts. When we look back on fiscal '13, it was a milestone year for STERIS. We completed the SYSTEM 1 transition and are very happy to have that behind us.
 We continued to invest in new products and quality processes to defend and grow our core businesses. Simultaneously, we continued execution of our strategy to expand into adjacent markets, with the purchase of U.S. Endoscopy, Spectrum and TRE. And we purchased the remaining interest in our OR integration partner VTS Medical.
 These acquisitions are doing well and our integration efforts are on track. I want to personally thank to people of STERIS, including our newest members from U.S. Endoscopy, Spectrum, TRE and VTS for managing through such a busy, but exciting time in our evolution.
 As a result of these activities, we did leverage our balance sheet a bit more, taking on an additional $200 million in debt toward the end of the year. Even with this additional leverage, we are very comfortable that our conservative balance sheet and we have plenty of dry powder for continued growth.
 We substantially improved our working capital management in FY '13, resulting in free cash flow in excess of our expectations. Last, but not least, we increased our dividend double digits for the seventh consecutive year to $0.19 per share per quarter.
 Due to careful execution of our strategies, our people turned fiscal '13 into a year of growth. And we anticipate carrying this momentum into fiscal 2014, delivering revenue and profit growth in line with our long-term targets. More specifically, we anticipate revenue growth of 8% to 10% in fiscal '14.
 As the acquisitions anniversary during the year, we will naturally have a stronger topline growth performance in the first half of the year, and anticipate total organic revenue growth of approximately 4% to 5%. We also anticipate growing earnings somewhat between 6% and 11%, which translates into earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.47 to $2.60. Excluding the medical device impact this year, our earnings would increase double digits versus FY '13.
 For your modeling purposes, let me provide a bit more color. We anticipate their earnings will be split approximately 42% in the first half of the year and 58% in the second half. This is somewhat different from our more typical 45%, 55% split of recent years, as a result of the timing of R&D spending as well as the timing of startup cost for the insourcing project that I discussed earlier.
 From a margin perspective, we anticipate an annualized expense of approximately $10 million for the medical device tax during fiscal 2014, which will be a headwind to our margin expansion. Our EBIT margin guidance of about 15.5% also assumes that R&D spending will increased to a bit over 3% of sales, reflecting both increased spending in our historic business as well as the higher spending rate in acquisitions. In addition, you will want to keep in mind that our interest expense has increased due to the additional debt taken on this past year.
 With these comments, I will hand the call back over to Julie for Q&A. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A session. Operator, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James. 
Konstantin Tcherepachenets: This is Konstantin in for Larry. I guess, if you can just start off on the topline growth. Walt, can you maybe just describe some of the factors that really drove outperformance this quarter. And then just can you maybe provide additional commentary in terms of your organic 4% to 5% growth. And maybe just commentary on the state of the U.S. capital equipment market, during this earning season we clearly heard some mixed messages, and it seems like you guys are actually continuing to have some positive momentum. 
Walter Rosebrough: I'll try to break, I think you had 3 questions there. I'll try to answer them sequentially. First, regarding the growth in Q4. As we mentioned in Q3, we were actually little soft in growth in Q3, and mentioned that the capital, as you know from history, can be a little bit lumpy. And particularly on the Healthcare side, we had very, very strong backlog ending Q3. So we were quite confident, we would have a solid Q4. And in turn we did have good orders in Q4 as well. And so we exceeded our expectations a little bit largely on the capital side, largely in Healthcare. But we also had very strong shipments in Life Science.
 So it was more the capital side of the business, both in Healthcare specifically and Life Science, where we did better than we expected. That would be the high level and it's reflected in our patterns. We ended up for the year, we actually grew backlog in Healthcare a few million dollars. So basically we shipped what the orders we took for the year, which is what you want to do. So we're very pleased with that. I forgot the second question, Julie, if you might give me an update.
 FY '14 organic is pretty well spread across the business. I suppose I can't think of any particular where it's a big spike in growth. So it's pretty well spread across the business. As you might expect the acquisition, first of all, we – of course the acquisitions you get a full year impact. We're still overcoming about $12 million or $13 million worth of S1E mostly in the first quarter, so there is kind of a mix and match there.
 But then the second piece is just the generalized growth. We are continuing to see the growth we expected to see in the Spectrum and U.S. Endoscopy acquisition. And we're seeing low-to-mid single digit growth, we see across the board in our other businesses. So I wouldn't point to anything significant that that's not something we've already talked about. So we're seeing pretty much in line with what we have been saying in the last 6 to 12 months, and not out of line with our long-term forecast.
 In terms of hospital spending - capital spending, there is pressure on hospital capital spending. There is no question about that. In particular, the IT dollars being spent for physician practices put pressure on that spending, so every dollar is scarce. But we continue to see what I would call solid capital spending in Healthcare. We're not seeing some big robust growth streak or a pent-up demand growth streak, but we're just continuing to see solid capital spending, both our backlog and our pipeline coming in so it's just the same.
 We're seeing very similar levels of large project dollars that we've seen, so we have some visibility out of a-1.5 year to 2 years, and we're seeing very similar levels. Although, just as we talked about, I think last quarter or the quarter before, I've forgotten when we discussed this, but we have seen slightly less projects, but the projects are bigger, so they equal out to being similar sized or maybe 2% or 3% greater. So very much in line with what we expected. So that's kind of what we are seeing at this point in time. 
Konstantin Tcherepachenets: And then just last question from me. Do you think longer-term out clearly you're doing insourcing and that should help margin. But can you maybe talk about longer-term opportunity in terms of just consolidating your manufacturing footprint or are there opportunities that can be significant driver of operating margin expansion? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, we have talked about the insourcing piece, and in fact that's really what we're doing with the footprint. As we get leaner, we have space available and we have people available to do more work, and there is 2 ways to solve that problem. One is to grow, which we anticipate doing. But the other one is to bring more of the work in-house, and we clearly are doing that.
 We think we can better quality, better cost and better visibility or I'll call it supply chain visibility, reliability for delivery for our customers. So we're doing all the above. So I would say as a general statement, working to continue to make the business more lean is a way that we can improve our cost position. So that's a general statement.
 The second is, as we're developing products, it's our desire, if you will, we're trying to develop those products. We wanted all products that can create more value for our customers, as we create more value, we should be able to get some price for that. We are in a particularly price sensitive point in time in this industry. So it's not like we're going to see 10% per year price increases while you stretch the imagination. But if you can get a point or 2 of price by creating more value for customers, that's a good deal for both of us. And that's what our intention would be.
 And then, lastly, we do want to continue to watch our overhead cost and spread those overhead cost over larger amounts of business. So just as you've described, it could be plant consolidations, but those more likely occur where we see acquisitions and where there is overlap of facilities or something like that. So that is a possibility going forward and that's something we will always be looking at. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jose Haresco, JMP Securities. 
Jose Haresco: Couple of questions here, so I guess I was just starting to think about next year's guidance for the Healthcare division. Could you parse out the difference between your outlook on capital versus consumables in that business. You also had a very strong Healthcare capital equipment performance this quarter, but as you mentioned they had a really great backlog too. So is it that sustainable or should we dampen that a little bit and wind that in a range of organic 4% to 5% for the capital? 
Michael Tokich: If you look at our projections for 2014 for Healthcare, we are looking at low-double digit revenue growth in total and I will bifurcate that to about mid-single digits for our organic growth, about high-single digits from the acquisitions and then more specifically on the capital it would be in the low-single digits that we'll be anticipating. So we continue to see capital growth, although in the low-single digits for fiscal 2014. 
Jose Haresco: The growth in your acquisitions, it's kind of funny, because most of the hospital [ph] companies in a lot of med-taxes have reported really bad or just unfavorable or not positive trends in patient volumes as we start to look out at the backend of the year. Your numbers in your guidance suggests the opposite, so what's going well in U.S. Endoscopy that seems to be plucking that trend? And I guess, in consumables in general, because it's kind of the trend here with regards to what that business needs to be telling us? 
Walter Rosebrough: One, you have to separate the types of consumables that are being used and you have to remember almost all of ours are linked to procedures, for example, patient days. And so I can't separate those 2 things for you. I'm not familiar with everybody else's forecasts as you are. But clearly we are more procedural-linked, than we are, we call it, inpatient day length. So if hospitals for example shorten their length of stay, but do more procedures, our consumables are more linked to those procedures, so that would be the first comment.
 The second comment again is underlying volume of procedures. We don't see that falling-off in total in significant ways over the course of the year, and so that our growth is linked to that. And specifically on U.S. Endoscopy a lot of those procedures, there are procedures interventions, but there are also a little diagnostic procedures in that arena. And we support a lot of those diagnostic procedures
 And we have a number of new products. So, U.S. Endoscopy growth is largely a function of brand-new to market products that are going from zero to something. And so that zero to something creates growth, and more growth, if you will, then the procedures in total. So that's the long and short story, if you will, of U.S. Endoscopy. I think I have covered what you've asked. 
Jose Haresco: And just the housekeeping, do you think 42% of the earnings would be in first half? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, we did. Jose, I wouldn't call it 42.000 though, we're not that good. 
Jose Haresco: As I think, Mike, you said you told me a long time ago for fiscal '14 would be the first kind of a clean year right, where all the SYSTEM 1 is kind of behind us from an operating perspective. So given that you're projecting the end of year 15.5% EBIT margin, where do we go from there? I mean, recognizing, not going to hold you anything, you already say about the years beyond that, but given that you're insourcing a lot of these components to improve your gross margin, you obviously have anniversary-ed these costs on the acquisitions. I think where does that margin ultimately go? 
Michael Tokich: Jose, I think we've talked about that before, we're always working to increase our margins. We're not always particularly successful in it, but we're always working to do that. I don't think that we're at a peak of margin percentage possibility. This year we're eating more the device tax, so presuming that at least stays flat for us and that we don't see increases in that range. We're working to increase our margins, but we're not planning on kind of step function change, 15.5% to 17%.
 I would like to see this going from 15.5% to 15.8% to 16.1% to pick a number at the end. I do think again in orders of magnitude, these kind of businesses ranges in the 15% to 20% range, I think it's reasonable if you get over 20%, I think you'll probably set up for being greedy and somebody will break you. You're setting price umbrella for lots of competition. And under 15% you should be working to get over. So we're happy to get back in that 15% range, above the 15% range, but we don't see ourselves stopping that. But we are not looking for step function change. We're looking for margin improvement. 
Jose Haresco: Something related to that, now you've been incredibly disciplined about your dividend increases every year. With cash flow improving, is it even fair to conjecture that overtime you might increase that rate of growth or is that something that's not part of your discipline? 
Walter Rosebrough: We are incredibly disciplined about our dividend policy. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Erin  Wilson: Just follow-up on insourcing, are the efforts there following behind your expectation or has anything, I guess, materially changed on that front with your strategy there? And it sounds like you don't have anything incorporated into your guidance in the way of cost savings this year or in fiscal '14, but are the cost associated with that implementation incorporated to the guidance. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Erin. I mean, I'll answer the general question. And hopefully I will pick up the new answers in yours. But first of all, we think the insourcing prices were moving nicely along. And we characterize them as 2 big projects, which it is kind of the way we think about it, but inside each of those big projects are many, many, many small projects. So as you might expect some of them are ahead and some of them are behind, but on balance, we're feeling good about where we are in that process. So that's the answer to your first question.
 Second question is, indeed we are not expecting any material savings or cost this year. Relatively speaking, due to those projects and what that is that we are achieving savings in the lead projects, which is the Mentor fabrication facility. We're achieving savings there. And we'll continue to grow those savings over the course of the year. But at the same time, we're kicking off other projects that have front-in-costs.
 And so what's happening is if you look at the year end total, we think we're going to about breakeven. And so next year we will see the full impact of the Mentor fabrication facility and begin to see the impact of the Montgomery facility, which has the other load of those projects.
 So that's why we're saying this year we think it's about breakeven, next year in $8 million to $10 million. So really next year $8 million is the rough estimate over the longer period. As you get down to '16, '17 we expect that to grow into roughly $10 million of savings. 
Erin  Wilson: And then on capital deployment kind of what's your capacity for incremental acquisitions at this point. And where is your focus there? You had mentioned that dividend, I guess, but particularly as it relates to acquisitions in international? 
Walter Rosebrough: As I said earlier, we feel pretty disciplined about our dividend policy. We don't have any expectation of moving off that. And then after that our next place to put money is in our businesses, both what you would have historically call the core businesses, but now also into U.S. Endoscopy Spectrum, because we didn't buy those businesses to sit on them, we bought them to grow on. And so we will continue to place money towards those, business in their primary businesses, which is why you're seeing the increase in R&D.
 The next piece is acquisitions. We feel very comfortable that we have significant dry powder to do continued acquisitions. And we will be looking in the same spaces of our current businesses as well as in adjacent spaces. And we are not limiting our look to the United States. So we clearly are looking outside the U.S. in that arena.
 We now have the bulk of our integration activities behind us in U.S. Endoscopy, I'd say essentially behind us in U.S. Endoscopy. We're well down the path on the Spectrum integrations. So we're feeling quite comfortable there. So we feel, not only do we have the financial capacity, but we feel that we have the management capacity to continue down that path. 
Erin  Wilson: And any geographies you're focused at all? 
Walter Rosebrough: We probably just would rather not say, I guess, there. Naturally, if there's trade-offs, the "growing markets" are of great interest to us. So as you know the markets in Asia Pacific, Latin America, that are more rapidly growing than others. And so they have interest in that regard, but where we have our base businesses in North America and Europe are also areas that we would consider. So we're not ruling out, if you will, specific geographies, but we are looking for different things in different places. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers, Great Lakes Review. 
Jason Rodgers: Looking at your guidance, I was wondering what you are looking for as far as performance in international market as well as commodity costs? 
Michael Tokich: Jason, I will address the commodity cost. Basically, we're looking at modest or I'll call it inflationary increases in raw material costs. Nothing out of line, nothing unique we're seeing this year versus the prior years. And on international, I could say, generally speaking we're expecting faster growth outside the United States with the exception of Europe and Europe is flat-to-down in our expectations. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal from Sidoti. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Just couple of quick questions. First I'm just wondering on the acquisition front, given the success you are having with your U.S. Endoscopy and Spectrum, how much are you expecting in terms of maybe an EPS contribution with the fiscal '14 guidance? 
Walter Rosebrough: We're not guiding, we're treating those businesses as product lines as we do all our product lines and we don't break the guidance into that group. So they are grouped into the businesses. But in terms of, if you looked at our statements when we did the acquisitions, we're not materially different from those feelings at the time. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And again, given the success you are having with those, has it changed your inclination in terms of being more aggressive in terms of pursuing acquisitions and do you have anything built into the guidance? 
Walter Rosebrough: We have no acquisitions built into the guidance. And I would say as we said last year, we've been looking to do things for the last 2 or 3 years. And sometimes, the people we want to acquire, it's not their time and so we work on their time more than our time, but we continue to pursue. I would say there is no difference in level of intensity. In the last couple of years, if you recall 4 or 5 years ago, we pretty much got out of business. We felt we had more opportunity to work inside our own business, but for the last 2 or 3 years, we have been working on it. We will continue to work down on that path, but we don't control the timing on those deals. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Then just a final quick question on, there is a big picture. I know the medical device taxes obviously hitting you above $0.10 this year, but as you look forward to 2014 and beyond in terms of the overall healthcare environment, are you more bullish in terms of where you are today? 
Walter Rosebrough: I wouldn't say more or less bullish. The good news is, I am going to separate the underlying demand first and then the capital consumable sides of the business.
 First in underlying demand, we have been saying and I think everyone has been saying and understands that the underlying demand is very strong. We are entering the period where the baby boomers are reaching peak healthcare use time between the age of late 50s and 70s. And so that pig is going to the python and I am one of the piglets, by the way, I am a mid-baby boomer.
 And I just had a hip replacement. So I am a classic person in that. And I think you're going to see more and more of that in the next decade. So the underlying demand is exceedingly strong. The question is what the government and other third-party payers and individuals do to reduce the cost of that underlying demand and how they utilize that demand and that is less clear.
 On the capital side, the more uncertainty there is, over a short period, it tends to disrupt capital over long periods. Change is almost always good for capital, because if you change things, you have to rejig or something and that is usually good for capital. So in the current timeframe, I suppose if you were to say vis-à-vis prior the election, when we didn't know if we would be continuing down the path of Accountable Care Act or not, I believe we're more bullish in the short term, because there is less uncertainty.
 The hospitals at least know what they are moving towards. If that changes over the next year or 2, then that will change in the short run. But in the long-run, the underlying demand, we think is very strong. 
Operator: I am showing no other questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back for any closing remarks. 
Julie Winter: Thanks everybody for joining us and have a great day. 
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-02-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the STERIS Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At the request of STERIS, today’s call will be recorded for instant replay.
 I’d now like to introduce today’s host, Julie Winter, Director, Investor Relations. Ma’am, you may begin. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Angie, and good morning, everyone. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to STERIS’s Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Conference Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us this morning.
 As usual, participating in the call are Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO.

 With those cautions, I’ll turn the call over to Mike. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I want to point out that with several items impacting our reported results all of which are excluded from our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
 As you saw in our earnings announcement, during the quarter, we reversed a portion of our original SYSTEM 1 class action settlement liability at the deadline for claims submission was December 31, 2012.
 The total pre-tax reversal was $15.8 million. The remaining liability on the balance sheet for both the SYSTEM 1 class action settlement and the SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program is now $5.5 million.
 Looking back our original pre-tax charge for both the SYSTEM 1 class action settlement and the SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program totaled $129.8 million. At the end of the day it turns out, the customers have utilized or have committed to utilize approximately $75 million of the $129.8 million pre-tax charge.
 Also during the quarter, we recorded a tax benefit associated with the deduction for U.S. tax purposes related to our European restructuring effort. This deduction is based upon the closing of our Swiss manufacturing facility back in the fall of 2011. As a result, we recorded an $8.1 million benefit through our tax provision during the quarter.
 And finally, we have expenses related to our acquisitions impacting the P&L. During the quarter, we recorded pre-tax expenses of $4 million for intangible amortization, $2.1 million for acquisition and integration costs, and $700,000 for inventories step up to fair value. Please see our earnings release for full reconciliation of as reported to adjusted earnings.
 With that, I will now begin with a review of our third quarter income statement. Total revenue increased 7% during the third quarter, driven by a 10% increase from acquisitions, 2% organic volume and 1% pricing improvement, somewhat offset by a 6% decline in our U.S. SYSTEM 1 and 1E business. Currency fluctuations were revenue neutral during the quarter.
 Gross margin in the quarter increased 150 basis points to 40.4%. The improvement in gross margin was positively impacted by the acquisitions and pricing, somewhat offset by a negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
 Adjusted EBIT for the quarter increased $1.6 million to $57.8 million. Adjusted EBIT as a percent of revenue for the quarter was 15.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points due primarily to the negative impact of our U.S. SYSTEM 1 and 1E business. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $34.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share as compared to $0.60 per diluted share in the prior year.
 Moving now to our segment results. Healthcare revenue in the quarter increased 5%. Contributing to the quarter, consumable revenue grew 37% and service revenue grew 28%. Capital equipment revenue declined 17%, primarily due to the ramp-up of SYSTEM 1E units during the prior year.
 Similar to last quarter, the performance of our healthcare consumable franchise reflected a combination of the acquisition of U.S. Endoscopy and growth in other consumables offset by the expected declines in S20 sterilant.
 Service revenue growth reflects the acquisition of Spectrum and TRE, as well as growth in other service offerings. Capital equipment revenue, excluding U.S. SYSTEM 1 unit sales declined 5% with flat performance in the U.S. offset by weakness in Europe and Latin America.
 We believe that the flat performance of our U.S. capital equipment business was a matter of timing as we ended the quarter with $140 million in backlog, excluding SYSTEM 1E, backlog increased double digits both year-over-year and sequentially.
 Healthcare operating income was $35.7 million or 13.2% of revenue, compared with $36.1 million or 13.9% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. The decline in profitability was the result of the expected decline in both S20 sterilant and SYSTEM 1E units in the U.S.
 Life Sciences revenue increased 16% in the quarter. Capital equipment revenue grew 32%, consumable revenue grew 8% and service revenue grew 6%. As we said last quarter, when capital equipment was down in the segment, the capital equipment shipments tend to vary from quarter-to-quarter. We do not believe that we are seeing a fundamental uptick in demand levels, but instead just witnessing the normal ebb and flow of capital equipment shipments.
 Volume growth continues to stem primarily from pharma customers who have resumed spending on replacement capital equipment. Life Sciences operating income was $12.8 million or 19.7% of revenue, compared with $10.3 million or 18.4% of revenue in the same period last year, driven primarily by the increases in volume. Backlog in Life Sciences was $49.6 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of 10%.
 Revenue for Isomedix increased 10% during the quarter. We continue to experience solid demand from our core medical device customers as well as a positive impact from our acquisition of Biotest. Isomedix operating margin fell slightly in the quarter to 25.6% of revenue as the increased volume was not enough to offset the margin impact of the recently expanded capacity, which came online during the quarter.
 In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $155.9 million of cash, the bulk of which sits outside of the U.S. As you may recall, in December, we completed a $200 million private placement transaction. The weighted average maturity is approximately 11.3 years at an average interest rate of 3.3%.
 As part of a deferred takedown, we received $100 million on December 4 and another $100 million on February 4, the proceeds of which were used for the repayment of our existing revolving credit facility debt. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter is $520.9 million. Our long-term debt consists of $310 million from our private placements and $210.9 million from our revolving credit facility.
 Our total debt-to-capital ratio is 36.2% and our total net debt to total -- to capital ratio is 28.4% in the quarter. Our free cash flow, excluding the SYSTEM 1 Rebate program and class action settlement for the first 9 months of fiscal 2013 was $133.3 million, compared with $75.6 million in the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow is attributable to improvements in working capital management and an $18 million cash benefit received from the tax deduction, I mentioned earlier.
 Our inventory levels as anticipated have been reduced as compared to the prior year, even with newly acquired inventory being added. In addition, our DSO now at 63 days has improved by 3 days compared to the prior year. Capital spending was $18.8 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $18.3 million. We remain on track to spend approximately $95 million of capital expenditures for the full year.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Appreciate you taking the time to join us this morning. As you’ve heard from Mike, we had a good quarter. Our growth strategies are beginning to show in our results and we are pleased with our acquired and base businesses. In fact, our overall company performance to date has exceeded our expectations somewhat, resulting in positive changes in our outlook.
 Let me spend a few minutes on several highlights before I discuss our revised outlook for the year. Starting with healthcare, we said in our last call that we continue to see solid trends for our capital equipment business in the U.S. offset somewhat by international weakness. Consistent with last quarter’s comments, we had flat shipment performance in the U.S. compared to a strong third quarter last year and international declines.
 But our overall capital order pipeline was strong and remains so to this day. We continue to believe the overall trend is solid and the shipments are a matter of timing given our order rate, which resulted in a strong backlog at the end of the quarter. On a year-to-date global basis, we are pleased that we’ve been able to grow capital equipment organically in the low single digits, excluding the impact of SYSTEM 1E in the U.S.
 Beyond capital equipment, our consumable and service revenue in healthcare is performing well. Our recently acquired businesses, U.S. Endoscopy, Spectrum and TRE are contributing nicely. Combined these 3 businesses added about $35 million to our revenue in the quarter, performing a bit better than our expectation.
 As an aside, we have decided to brand the 2 acquired specialty service businesses under the Spectrum brand. So that is how we will refer to the combined Spectrum and TRE going forward. In addition to the acquired businesses, we are experiencing low single-digit organic revenue growth in both consumables and in service.
 Rounding out our discussion of healthcare, we completed [audio gap] VTS has been our partner for integrated operating room solutions since 2009 and over that time, we have grown this business substantially. Our partnership has proven to be successful and we are happy to have VTS fully under this STERIS umbrella.
 Our Life Sciences segment had a very good third quarter. Life Sciences capital was up 32% versus last year’s third quarter, balancing up the declines in capital equipment we reported in Q2 and we have solid backlog. As you know, this business tends to be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter so we evaluate our performance over the longer periods.
 When we look at our year-to-date performance, we are in line with our expectation and pleased with our position heading into Q4. Isomedix continues to deliver solid growth, due in part to the capacity we have recently brought online, as well as the Biotest acquisition last March.
 As you’ve seen before with previous expansions in Isomedix, it takes time to fill newly added capacity. As a result, our operating margins dip slightly in the quarter. We anticipate more fully utilizing this capacity over the coming periods.
 Our balance sheet, including our recently acquired businesses continues to strengthen, and our cash flow generation remains strong. We have successfully locked in what we believe to be favorable long-term borrowing rates through our recent private placement. We believe that our outstanding debt levels are reasonable and we have ample cash flow and debt capacity to fund future investments.
 Turning now to our outlook for the fiscal year, we are heading into our final quarter with good momentum in our business and year-to-date results slightly ahead of our expectations. As a result, we are increasing our projection for revenue growth to about 5% for the full year.
 In particular, we anticipate our healthcare segment will deliver higher revenue in the fourth quarter both sequentially and year-over-year to help fulfill that forecast. And we expect that strength primarily from organic growth in North America.
 Reflecting the improved volume, we’re moving our earnings outlook to the high end of our prior range. Our new outlook for adjusted EPS is now $2.25 to $2.35. Since we are actually being impacted in our fourth quarter by the medical device tax for the very first time, we have included our estimate of the $0.03 negative impact from the device tax in our revised outlook.
 Bottom line, we anticipate that we will be able to deliver earnings for the year in the top half of our original range while absorbing one quarter’s impact of the device tax, which was not included in our original guidance.
 With those comments, I will turn the call back over to Julie to begin our Q&A sessions. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike for your comments. We’re now ready to begin the Q&A session. So Angie, would you please give the instructions and we’ll get started. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from that Ms. Erin Wilson of Bank of America. 
Erin  Wilson: Apologies if I missed this, but did you quantify the contribution from U.S. Endoscopy, specifically in the quarter and its integration on track and now you started to see some maybe greater clarity on the potential synergies there and when we should start to see those materialize? 
Michael Tokich: Erin, we did breakout the revenue growth from the 3 units to combine. It’s about $35 million. We are not breaking out the individual units and both acquisitions, or all 3 acquisitions I should say are tracking as we expected, slightly better actually than we expected but not materially different than our feelings or expectations.  You recall that U.S. Endoscopy is not primarily a cost reduction kind of acquisition. We thought that was a good growing business. We do think there is some long-term revenue synergies, but we feel no differently about that acquisition than we have been discussing from the beginning. 
Erin  Wilson: Okay. And then I guess in light of your recent deal activity, which are kind of capacity here for incremental acquisitions and how should we think about your, I guess capital deployment strategy going forward as it relates out to share repurchases and the dividend? 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. First of all, I would say our general strategy on capital deployment has not changed at all. We are first -- first place, we wanted to deploy capital is in the businesses that we already own and run, because we think that’s the safest and best spending as long as there is good places to do it. And as you know this year, we are spending a pretty good chunk of money doing that.  Our second is looking at growth opportunities through acquisition and we would continue to do that. We clearly intend our dividend to -- we’ve been on a path to grow our dividends and we expect to do that going forward and then the last alternative is share buyback.  When I say last alternative, obviously is we are looking at acquisitions. We compare those acquisitions to doing share buybacks. So it sets a standard for us, but generally speaking we would work to spend money to grow as oppose to work to spend for share buyback. To the extent, we think it’s a more attractive opportunity.  In terms of integration, we are busy with integration right now, but it’s now been several months since the U.S. Endoscopy acquisition and really it’s just been a blessing. We talked about the fact that they are geographically close to us. It is remarkable how much easier it makes that work when you just walk across the parking lot as opposed to having to fly across the countries. So that is going I think exceedingly well.  The other 2 companies, one is also only about an hour from us and the other one is not that far. It’s in Pennsylvania. So we think those are going nicely. But those are in earlier phase of the transition. We would not feel constrained in the next few months doing something else that we saw as appropriate opportunity. And certainly in the businesses to non-healthcare businesses, Isomedix and Life Science we would feel not constrained at all. 
Erin  Wilson: Okay. And then just quick one on Isomedix that you mentioned it. I think Cardinal Health mentioned last week that they were divesting their sterilization business in EL Paso. I know you have a business also in EL Paso, and they said that they are going to contact with the third party, and then the third party would retain I guess its facilities and its sort of infrastructure I guess down there. I guess you are a logical sort of partner for that business. Can you kind of quantify that opportunity and is that incorporated into your guidance? 
Walter Rosebrough: We don’t quantify any activities for individual customers or individual accounts and we let them speak for themselves about what they’re going to do. So our growth forecasts include all the known customers that we know and we tend to do long-term contracts. But we don’t comment on any specific ones. 
Operator: Larry Keusch of Raymond James. 
Lawrence Keusch: So Walt, a couple of questions. First, if you could just talk little bit about the environment and specifically you mentioned in the prepared comments that the U.S. feels like it is pretty good. But if you could just give us some sense of what you think it’s -- or happening out there with hospital capital spending, and where it’s been deployed that would be helpful and then I have 2 others for you? 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. In general, hospital capital spending seems to be holding up. It’s not huge increase but it seems to be holding up. Clearly, as I think many people were reporting and talking about, they are spending an awful lot of money as it relates to their electronic medical record or their IT funding. So that’s absorbing a good piece of capital spending. Clearly they are also spending, what I call strategic spending in physician office area or physician area as well as outsourcing of their facilities.  So those are, I think probably there are 2 top of mind capital spends. Having said that, we do feel somewhat fortunate in our space, which is the operating room and things what support the operating room on the capital side is an area that is a revenue generation area in the short-term and a place where people want to capture strategically in the longer-term.  So we do think, relative to maybe some other things, we might be in a slightly better space for capital spending. But every capital dollar is scarce these days, particularly given the fact that the significant spending in the IT literate medical record side. So it’s not what we would call a robust growth area, but it seems to be solid. 
Lawrence Keusch: Okay. And just along that, Walt, if you just look back over the last 3, 4, 5 months and you want to look at the sort of second derivative out there. Is it flat or is it actually, do you feel like it may even be getting a little bit better? 
Walter Rosebrough: We’ve been saying kind of now for 6 months or so that our pipeline has been pretty steady and it’s varied. The makeup of the pipeline has bounced around, which it has a habit of doing. At the beginning of the year, we were clearly seeing more what we would call one-off replacement business as opposed to large projects.  So our pipeline was more full of that than -- more full of replacement type business than the large projects. We’ve seen large projects. In total, if you look at kind of the full pipeline you are looking at a year or 2, that pipeline has stayed fairly stable. It moves between few very big projects and lots of medium-size project and that’s kind of moved in a wave around. But if you put it altogether, it’s just been what I would call kind of steady, steady to maybe slightly up. 
Lawrence Keusch: Okay. Perfect. And then the other the other 2 questions is I recognized you are not prepared to give ‘14 guidance on this call. But I wonder if you can just help us think about as we do look forward sort of what we should be thinking for the headwinds and tailwinds sort of that puts and takes, as we just begin to think about next year.  And then the second question and you partially answered this, but in terms of your capital allocation if you were to go through a period of time where there was no meaningful deal activity, would you be willing to essentially return more cash to shareholders in those periods where there is less usage of the capital for M&A? 
Walter Rosebrough: Let me start with the first. I think 2 general questions. One is you are well spoken to recognize that we’ve not given next year’s guidance now, because we are not. But at the highest level I would say clearly everyone in the industry, at least our side of the industry faces a medical device tax for the full year. So that’s clearly something that is just front center for everybody.  The other things are things that we’ve been talking about a long time. Again, the pipeline right now we think seems fairly stable out there, to the extent that stays that way we will be pleased. We’ve clearly have done some things through business development to acquire things to grow our business and we continued to do product development. And then we discussed I think a fair amount about some of the capital spending we are doing in order to, A, bringing new products and B, do some in-sourcing. So at a high level that’s what we’re doing. We don’t have any further guidance on that than we’ve already provided.  Now the second question relates to shares, I think share buyback? And as we said, we rank those things as we’ve described and just described, share buyback -- share buyback is clearly something that we consider. We in the board look at those things and to the extent we see a longer, if you will dry spell then we would clearly be looking at share buybacks. Any given month or any given quarter of that that’s not going to cause us to make significant fluctuations in share buybacks. And we do have authorization and we have bought back in recent past and we would certainly consider doing so in the future. 
Operator: Jose Haresco from JMP Securities. 
Jose Haresco: A couple of questions here, so let’s start with on the recurring revenue side of the healthcare business and the SYSTEM 1? Are we at a point now where S20 is not a drag on the S40 or is that business still, say, essentially negative growth? 
Michael Tokich: I would say that we’ve actually crossed the point where actually S40 is actually overtaken from a volume perspective S20 and that was probably a quarter ago or so. But we still have as you know, we still have through August of next year, the deadline for SYSTEM 1, transition was August 2.  So we still have a few more months into this year -- the next quarter and handful months into next year from a comparability standpoint. So we will continue to you see some pressure, but obviously the volume of that pressures is actually reduced. 
Walter Rosebrough: Jose, the real question is, whether you are talking sequentially or year-over-year and Mike answered it correct, absolutely correctly on the year-over-year and effectively sequentially that is, sequentially we are not seeing those kinds of declines. 
Jose Haresco: Okay. Good. I’m sorry, if I missed this, did you tell us how many system and how many SYSTEM 1 units were placed it all in the quarter, are we replacing? 
Walter Rosebrough: No. We are out of the, we’re through that phase in our history and we are going to be treating SYSTEM 1E just like we do with the other product, we don’t give product specific items. But just as an aside, you would not find them material. 
Jose Haresco: Okay. The U.S. Endoscopy, when you look at the growth in the reimbursement, sorry, I may miss this, the recurring revenue in the quarter 37%, how much of that was U.S. Endoscopy, how much of that was everything else? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, again, the splits that we are going to give, is the total revenue from the 3 acquisitions, which we said about $35 million in the quarter. Almost, virtually all of that, not all of that is recurring revenue either service or recurring medical devices, so that splits we are giving. We are not going to break those out further, it’s part of the healthcare group, except.  Mike, does have one additional comment that may help. 
Michael Tokich: Yes. In total and I’ll give you just a little bit of background from the breakout for the consumables and service, from an organics standpoint it was about mid single digits for both the consumable and service in the quarter. 
Walter Rosebrough: Including healthcare. 
Jose Haresco: Okay. And again, now on U.S. Endoscopy, are you at the point where you have a view and how we should think about that business for next year and kind of the organic growth in that business, number one?
 And number two, if not quite logistic in the sense that you are not reducing that channel in terms of the headcount. So have you thought ahead to what you might be bringing into that channel and when we might start to see that level or that type of activity? 
Walter Rosebrough: Again, I think, going back to our comments, when we did the deal, would probably be the best guidance that I would give you, because we just don’t feel any differently about it today than we did 3 months ago, 4 months ago. It’s on track with what we thought and what we said, so that's what the long and short of it is.  And in general this has been a nicely growing business in the low double digits and we don’t have any reason at this moment to feel differently about that, we are not -- again, we are not doing a forecast today. But we don’t feel any differently than we did 3, 4 months ago. 
Jose Haresco: Okay. And I guess lastly, do you have perhaps a longer term view on what the impact on the operating profit for healthcare could be as not just U.S. Endoscopy but perhaps other types of products like can take you from where we are today? And I’m thinking and I’m give yourself enough time, time not 12 months something like 3 to 5 years, how that change or think about the long-term profitability of that business? 
Walter Rosebrough: Again, at this point, we have no reason to view the long-term profit of healthcare to be significantly different from kind of our previous conversations. So now we are in the 10%, 12%, 13% -- 11%, 12%, 13% range, we can be kind of bouncing around those kinds of numbers.  We like seeing our income being in the 15% or better range. So that’s what we would be targeting over the long-term. We clearly -- we clearly have said that we expect to grow our business in total in terms of profitability in the low double digits and that’s clearly what our goals and intentions are. Exactly how that works out from year-to-year and month-to-month, we’ll bounce around, but that’s our goal.  The -- and we don’t see the reason to vary that goal. This short-term headwind of the medical devices tax is not trivial, and so that will have to sort of sought out and play itself out. So that would be I would say from all the activity put it all together, that headwind is not trivial. And we’ll sought that through and talk about it in our guidance when we do it in the coming quarter. 
Operator: Chris Cooley from Stephens Incorporated. 
Christopher Cooley: Let me start off, just talk, I mean a little about into balance of the year, you raised guidance here for the full year, but your core business ex-acquisition was down 3% roughly in the quarter?  I just want to make sure I understand really what’s driving that step up. Is it better growth then you had anticipated within the 3 recent acquisitions or are you, when you think about when guidance was set for the start of this calendar year, I mean, fiscal year, excuse me, you were looking for flattish growth on an organic basis pre-U.S. Endoscopy? Do you think you are going to get back to that kind of level? I’m just trying to think about the puts and takes there for the top line and I have a quick follow up? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. Chris, let me, again, let me step back, and as we’ve said before, the sequential SYSTEM 1 issue is over in our view, but the year-to-year comparisons are not. And in the quarter, I recall about a $20 million differential in SYSTEM 1E. So if we had that $20 million back it would be very different looking quarter. So if -- when we think organically now, we are thinking that kind of organic. So that’s the -- I call it Q3 over Q3 question I think that you are raising.  We also have particularly strong Q3 last year in capital shipments too. So if you -- we were little stronger this year in the first and second quarter, and relatively a little weaker but, when you kind of put it all together that evens it out, and we still have significant SYSTEM 1E revenue degradation on a year-over-year basis, even though again sequentially we are not seeing that. So I think that gets to the answer your first question.
 Second question, you kind of just step back and say what’s happened overall over the course of the year, clearly the acquisitions brought growth. But secondly, if you look across each of the business we look at, what our expectations were when we started and how they’re working right now, cumulative year-to-date plus what we expect in the next quarter, it’s just one of those years where everybody is either on plan or slightly ahead.  So it’s not anyone big thing. It is just often times, if you have several businesses and units within those businesses, somebody has a particularly difficult year and somebody has a great year and the math works out. In this case, relative to our plans, kind of, overall those businesses, everybody is, kind of, on plan or a little ahead. So when you add it all together, we’re a little ahead of where we expected to be.  I will say clearly been like almost everyone in the business who has reported in the last 6 months or so, everybody is seeing pressure in Europe. Latin America is not super strong. The Asian market has been strong for us. A specific market has been strong for us. I think that’s consistent and in North America, we’ve been solid. And so that’s, kind of -- on a geographic basis, that’s kind of a wrap-up. 
Christopher Cooley: Okay. That’s helpful. And could you just maybe, I apologize, if you told this at the start as I was hopping between earnings calls for this morning. But Life Sciences was particularly strong here in the quarter relative to our expectations. Could you maybe just, kind of, characterize what you were seeing there in terms of trends during the quarter and how we should think about that in terms of the backlog going forward? 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Chris. Again, in the Life Sciences business, Mike mentioned we’ve, kind of, had bouncy quarters if you will, which is not atypical particular in capital. So we had a particularly strong first quarter, not such a strong second quarter -- and talking year-over-year particularly and then a strong third quarter.  So it’s mainly the timing of capital, if you’re even all-out, it’s just about what we expected. They do have a nice backlog. So we expect to have -- have them finished the year about as we expected. So just solid, no significant change in our view on that. 
Operator: Robert Goldman from C.L. King. 
Robert Goldman: Couple of questions on the acquisition and then some on the cash flow or acquisitions. I understand Walt that the rationale for the acquisition was not a cost-cutting synergy rationale. But could you take us through how you see this synergies having worked so far.  Clearly, you are looking for revenue synergies, so perhaps you can give us some even anecdotal look of how essentially 1 plus 1 equals 3. In other words, you were able to get some core STERIS sales having made those acquisitions or those companies were able to leverage the STERIS product line? And then I’ll ask the cash flow question thereafter. 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. Look, first, Bob, as again as I mentioned in both cases or all the cases, this was not “significant cost synergy” set of acquisitions, but as is often the case we do find cost synergies when we do these things. So we have been fortunate. We’re a little ahead of where we thought we would be there and it’s what I will call for lack of better terms routine back-office kind of things or purchasing and supply kind of things.  So we are a little ahead there than what we expected in the businesses. And in terms of what I’ll call the sale synergies, I think those are longer-term kind of issues. But in both cases, it’s not so much that the products overlap, it’s of the customers overlap. And so we clearly wanted to be stronger in GI, a procedural area that has nice growth and nice opportunities. And we were pretty much only in the -- for lack of better terms again the back office of the GI where they are cleaning things and not in the action part, where they are doing things.  As opposed to our other business where we are both in SSD and surgical suite, so do think those will have a longer-term product development and revenue/sale synergies. We would have going forward been investing more money to grow sales force more specific to G.I., had we not done this deal. So there is a longer-term sale synergy there.  But we have had some successes, I don’t think we’ll go in into individual ones for people recognize that, "Gee, you have STERIS person here and a person from one of the acquisitions," and it is helpful for them to be able to cross those things and we think we’ll see more of that. But it really is continuing to fill those areas in the hospital or in the GI suites where we are -- where we already had presence and we’re growing that presence. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. Then on the cash flow, I have questions on that. The improvement in the inventory and the days receivable, Mike, could we attribute that to improvement in core STERIS or was there sort of some low hanging fruit in the acquired company that you’re able to affect the quick working capital fix to improve the DSO in the inventory turn? 
Michael Tokich: Yes. Most of that, Bob, was attributed to core STERIS and if you look at our working capital improvements, the one thing I would definitely highlight is our DSOs. We’ve done a very nice job of reducing our DSOs. And if you remember, we talked about some large collections that we had in Spain during the first quarter that improved our European collection efforts and then also within the U.S. as we gotten through a lot of the SYSTEM 1E issues, our collection efforts have definitely improved.  So we really haven’t seen much improvement on the acquired businesses at this point in time, although their collection efforts are good. They have not really shown much benefit to us to dramatically change. So it’s more core STERIS.  And then on the inventory standpoint, we did take in about $15 million of inventory from the acquired businesses. But really the benefit that we’ve been given is as you recall during the transition of SYSTEM 1 and 1E, we chose to build inventory for more safety stock, if you will, to make sure that we were not hold up as we delivered SYSTEM 1E units to our customers. So that has been brought down significantly. So the combination of those 2 have really help improved our free cash flow for the year. 
Robert Goldman: And as we think about and I understand, that so you’re not making projections beyond fiscal ‘13, but you presented 2 free cash flow numbers and both are accurate for 2013, one without the Rebate program in the tax and the other with?  As we think about how you might grow free cash flow from 2013, which of those numbers, which was the base that they you want us to focus on? 
Michael Tokich: Well, obviously we presented both numbers because there is such a large, almost a $17 million impact on our free cash flow because of the payments we are making from both the Rebate program and the class action settlements. So we wanted to specifically bifurcate those and show everybody the impact.  So I would say, if you look at those excluding the SYSTEM 1 Rebate and class action, that’s what I would be focusing more on and that’s the $133 million that we have provided in our comments or my comments. 
Robert Goldman: And then one final question on the cash flow, you’re recognizing, what look to be a very impressive improvement in the working capital. Are you at a point of that momentum where the improvements can sort of repeat themselves or you’re going to have an equal improvement beyond this year or whether some quick things that could be fixed are fixed and that makes the further improvement bit more difficult for next year? 
Michael Tokich: Obviously the 2 improvements I talked about the DSO and the SYSTEM IE inventory. I wouldn’t call them quick fixes by any means. We’ve been working very hard at both -- driving both of those improvements. But obviously we do have some further improvements, as we look to next year as our in-sourcing comes on hand and we have the opportunity to potentially further reduce our inventory.  And then obviously with the acquisitions, hopefully, we will be able to aid them in improving their cash collection efforts. So I would think that there is still some improvements. Now again, it will vary quarter-to-quarter but looking longer-term, we feel very good about our ability to generate free cash flow. 
Walter Rosebrough: And I would add. We have discussed kind of a longer-term view of that, and we said that we are kind of targeting in the $125 million to $150 million range of free cash flow. If you exclude these kinds of -- I hate to call things one time, but discrete -- let’s call them events. But if you separate that out we are thinking at $125 million to $150 million range.  We do think -- firstly, on the DSO side we are pretty attractive DSO and we operate in some places where that’s not normal. And so, I think our opportunities on the DSO side were probably not as great as potential opportunities on the inventory side as you look at those things. But we keep working everything down, that’s part of the objective. 
Robert Goldman: And then just one final question. Just remind us where the medical device excise tax is included? Is that SG&A? 
Michael Tokich: We have chosen to include the medical device tax in our cost of goods sold, and it will be represented in the fourth quarter and going forward in cost of goods sold. 
Operator: Greg Halter from Great Lake Review. 
Gregory Halter: We got to add an "s" to those lakes. Just wondered if you could comment on your facility down in Mexico and what’s going on there and what you see going forward from that plant? 
Walter Rosebrough: There is not a great deal to comment on. Those are operating well. I would not characterize anything radically different from that plant to our other factories. So it’s been about 5 years now basically since we cranked it up. And as you know we had some start-up issues 5 years ago.  But since certainly in last 3.5 years, that’s been a very stable environment. Things are going well, no issues. Every plant has its day and one operating issue -- one operating issue good or one operation issue bad. But there is nothing really to speak up on that plant that I would differ from the others. 
Gregory Halter: All right. And as you elaborated, your capital spending will be up this year. I think you said $95 million is the plan for the year, which is somewhat above what you’ve done historically. Just wondered if we can expect -- I know you are not going to give guidance, but going forward if that number is something -- and I know you have the acquisition as well. But is that 95 number a new base to build off of or it’s just an unusually high year? 
Walter Rosebrough: I hope it is because those investments that we are making are we think good money-making investments. We are doing several things simultaneously. I think it’s probably unlikely that we would have every year at that level. But where we do any acquisitions, we’ll add obviously some capital spending.  That’s probably -- at a steady state basis that maybe a little high. But we continue to push our guys to look for opportunities to invest in the business first. And to the extent they do that. I would be thrilled to spend $95 or $100 million every year as long as we get the returns on it that we expect. And I suspect that might be a little high. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. That certainly sounds good, especially with the low-cost of borrowing these days. One last one for you. Definitely, I have to give you congratulations on the fortitude in the Life Science business. I think there was a time 5 to 7 years ago when pieces of that were sold, and I think you were trying to sell other pieces from that.  But wondered if relative to Life Science and the other 2 divisions, if you can give your -- what you see happening there maybe over the next 3 to 5 years for each one of those business and I think you touched on them briefly. But just wondered if you could the elaborate on where you see those 3 businesses going. 
Walter Rosebrough: I assume you are saying, Life Science, Healthcare and Isomedix. 
Gregory Halter: That is correct. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. I think I have touched on Healthcare pretty much, but obviously there is a reasonable amount of uncertainty and turmoil in the Healthcare business, not our business but the healthcare business broadly as everyone tries to figure out exactly how the Affordable Care Act is going to -- Accountable Care Act, excuse me, is going to affect the system.  And so as a general statement if you watch the hospitals and the surgery centers, so go they, we will tend to go slowly because we serve them and we are at their pleasure and at their leisure. And it’s our hope that they will do well and find ways to do well. We think they will and we will follow them.  There is no question in my mind that the next 10 to 15 years there will be significant demand pressure on the system. And we think demand pressure on the system is good for us and now I’ll speak broadly about all 3 businesses. It’s good for all 3 businesses. Isomedix serves largely speaking the medical device industry and the volume of medical devices and procedures is what drives their business.  If you go deep in the fundamental level, that’s what drives that business. My personal view is that volume is going to be strong. People like myself, who were kind of in the middle of the baby boom age are entering the time when we spend lot of money on things like implants and stents and various others fantastic devices that our compatriots make and we sterilize for them. So we see that demand not letting up.  I fully expect to be price pressure in those arenas. We with everybody else will have to work on those price pressures. But there has been price pressures for a good long time and I suspect there will be price pressures for another 20 years. But the underlying demand is clear. And if you move outside the U.S. and underlying demand across the world is even clearer and stronger.  On Life Science side, our Life Science guys largely serve large pharmaceutical, plants and research and again we see out there is those areas are fruitful. The large pharmaceutical companies as you guys know went through a pretty tough period in the last 5, 6, 7, 8 years and that really dampened the demand on the capital side of that business. But it never changed the conversation or the demand on the consumable side. And we tend to serve the vaccine business even more so than the rest of those. And vaccines as you know are doing quite nicely and there is lots of good reasons for them to be doing nicely.  So we again see the demand there as solid. Again, there will be price pressures. There has been a lot of consolidation in that business. There maybe more, but again the underlying demand if you have a long-term view, which I think is what you are shooting at. The 3, 5, 10 year, we see that as a good opportunity. So I think that sums it up. At a high level I think you will see underlying demand -- global underlying demand, faster growth in the lesser industrialized countries and price pressures is everywhere.  And we will have to work on that and make sure that we deliver value. Again, the good news for us, both our business and in the industry as whole is we represent 4, 5, 6, 7 kind of maximum percent of the cost of Healthcare. So if we can somehow figure out a way to make a little 5%, make the 95% more efficient, there is a lot of opportunity for us and that’s what we are really shooting to do. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Mitra Ramgopal from Sidoti. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Just a couple of quick questions. First on the medical device tax, I think annualized it looks like it’s going to be about $0.12. I was just wondering if there is anything you can do to help maybe mitigate some of the impact. I know we’ve been hearing about some manufacturers try to implement price increases for one, I don’t know if that’s an option available to you? 
Walter Rosebrough: I’ll step up back in the device tax and generally, you know from our previous comments and we think that tax is bad policy. We have been working with Advumen [ph] from time zero, as well as other organizations who view this as bad policy. We are still hopeful that we’ll wake up and realize that someday, and reverse that policy. But at this point, we are in the mix and we’re paying it and away we go.  That is a cost like every other cost in our business. And when we wake up one morning and one of our, price of screws go up, it’s kind of hard to run your customer and say, "Gosh, the price of screws went up, we want to raise our prices." They are resistant to price increases and many of our products we have long-term contracts.  So quite clearly when, again, one of our component cost goes up, we are -- we would love to be able to just say, "Hey, why don’t we just pass that straight through to the end user." But they appropriately think that it’s our job to try to mitigate that cost at other places. So -- and I don’t see a line item, "Oh, gee I’m going to send you a 2% price increase" happening in this business in general or with us specifically.  So we will be doing the same things. I think virtually everybody is doing. We look more carefully at our costs. We will be considering our hiring programs. We are considering other ways to make our businesses more efficient. We’ll be considering investing in and growing in places that do not have a device tax, which means outside the United States, and we will be looking at our long-term pricing, all things together.  So I think, that’s unfortunate for the industry for the business and my personal view is, it’s not good tax policy. I think, clearly the industry feels that way. But we will do all the things one normally does when a component of its cost rises. 
Mitra Ramgopal: This is very helpful. And quickly on acquisitions, I know 3 you did recently. You’ve been working out very well? As you look at the potential pipeline going forward? I just wondering if the focus is pretty much going to be in U.S. and also if it’s going to be more case of tuck-in acquisitions in terms of your existing lines or you’re going to potentially consider entering new areas? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. I think, I have been fairly consistent on what I call acquisition policy. We certainly not limited to the U.S. You may recall we bought a business in Brazil about 1.5 years ago, or 2 years ago, maybe.  So we clearly are looking outside the U.S. we continue to. Because we are at this time 75% of our business roughly is in the U.S. and when you’re looking for things that are tangential or where you have a channel and you want to put another product into that channel or those kinds of things, it’s obviously easier to find those where you already are. But you are also looking for extensions into other places. So -- when I'm saying other places, meaning geographic extensions and so we could easily do things outside the U.S.  At the highest level, it is highly unlikely that we will go off and do something with a bunch of customers we don’t know, with the product we don’t know. We will be far more interested in doing something where we know the customers, know the space and then are bringing new products, or different product or added products, I want to say that to that space. If we have other ways to where we can move our current products into a different channel, we do that, that Life Sciences is the classic example there.  So the general answer is, we will continue to look at tuck-in kind of acquisitions and acquisitions where there are things where we are applying something we already know and not trying to learn something absolutely new. 
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back for any closing remarks. 
Julie Winter: This concludes our call for this morning. Thanks everybody for joining us and we’ll talk to you again next quarter. 
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q2  (2012-10-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the STERIS Fiscal 2013 Second Quarter Conference Call.  [Operator Instructions] At the request of STERIS, today’s call will be recorded for instant replay. I would now like to introduce today’s host, Mike Tokich, Senior Vice President and CFO. Sir, you may begin. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Melinda, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to STERIS’s Fiscal 2013 Second Quarter Conference Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. With me today is Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO.
 Now just a few words of caution before we begin. This webcast contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today, October 31, 2012. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited.
 I would also like to remind you that the discussion may contain forward-looking statements related to the company, its performance or its industry which are intended to qualify it for the protection under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. No assurance can be given as to any future financial results. Actual results could differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update or revise these forward-looking statements, even as events make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied in this or company statements will not be realized.
 Investors are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company’s control. Additional information concerning factors which could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in today’s earnings release. As a reminder, during the call we may refer to non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted earnings, free cash flow, backlog, debt-to-total capital, days sales outstanding, all of which are defined and reconciled, as appropriate, in today’s press release or our most recent 10-K filing, both of which can be found at steris-ir.com.
 As you saw this morning in our earnings announcements, during the quarter, we reversed a portion of our original SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program liability. The total pre-tax reversal was $21.5 million and is based on actual experience to date. Of the total reversal, $20.4 million is attributable to the Customer Rebate portion of the program and was recorded as an increase to revenue and the remaining $1.1 million is attributable to the disposal costs related to SYSTEM 1 units to be returned and was recorded as a reduction to cost of revenue.
 In addition, in the quarter, we incurred a total of $5 million or $0.06 per diluted share of costs related to the recent acquisitions of U.S. Endoscopy, Total Repair services and Spectrum.
 I want to highlight that many of the comments made today by Walt and me are based on adjusted or non-GAAP measures. I also want to point out that starting this quarter, our fiscal 2013 guidance will now be provided solely on an adjusted basis. That means that revenue, net income and earnings per diluted share will exclude the impact of the SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program reversal, amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, as well as certain other items.
 We believe that the adjusted measurements provide meaningful information in order to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and in assessing future performance. Reconciliations to our reported U.S. GAAP numbers are included in today’s earnings release.
 With that I will now begin with a review of our second quarter income statement.
 Total revenue declined 2% during the second quarter, driven by a 5% decline in volume and a 1% negative impact from currency fluctuations, offset by a 3% increase from acquisitions and a 1% improvement in pricing. Gross margin in the quarter increased 30 basis points to 39.4%. While we are pleased with this improvement, we continue to be negatively impacted from our U.S. SYSTEM 1 and 1E business on the gross margin line. The rest of our business, excluding SYSTEM 1 and 1E, expanded gross margin by 120 basis points, reflecting the benefits of product mix and favorable foreign currency fluctuations.
 EBIT for the quarter decreased $2.6 million to $47.2 million. EBIT as a percentage of revenue for the quarter was 14%, a decrease of 50 basis points from last year, caused by lower revenue attainment. Net income for the quarter was $31 million or $0.53 per diluted share, the same as the prior-year second quarter.
 Moving on to our segments results. Healthcare revenue in the quarter declined 3%. Capital equipment revenue declined 11%, driven by the expected post-transition decline in SYSTEM 1E unit sales and some international weakness, offset by growth in the United States. Consumable revenue increased 12%, as growth in other consumables more than offset continued reductions in the combined S20/S40 sterilant volumes.
 Service revenue increased 2%, driven primarily by growth in service contracts. Healthcare revenue in the quarter - sorry, Healthcare backlog in the quarter was $119.2 million. Given where we are in the SYSTEM 1 transition process, our SYSTEM 1E backlog, as anticipated, has been substantially eliminated. Healthcare backlog, excluding SYSTEM 1E, is lower by 9% versus the prior year, but has increased 21% sequentially.
 Healthcare operating margin in the quarter was 11.3% of revenue. This represents a decline versus the prior year, caused by lower revenue attainment due to the timing of shipments, the phase out of S20 sterilant in the U.S. and fewer SYSTEM 1E units.
 Life Sciences revenue decreased 7% in the quarter. Capital equipment revenue declined 24%. Consumables revenue grew 5% and service revenue grew 1%. Backlog in Life Sciences was $50.6 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of 23% compared with last year. Life Sciences operating margin increased to 19.3%. The operating margin expansion is a result of a mix shift towards recurring revenue in the quarter.
 Revenue for Isomedix increased 11% in the quarter. We continue to experience solid demand from our core medical device customers, as well as a positive impact from our acquisition of Biotest. Isomedix's operating margin increased by 60 basis points as a result of increases in revenue volume. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $156.6 million of cash, the bulk of which sits outside of the United States and $434.3 million in long-term debt.
 Our long-term debt consists of $210 million from our private placement funding and $224 million drawn from our revolving credit facility used to partially fund the acquisition of U.S. Endoscopy. Our total debt-to-capital ratio is 33.1% and our total net debt-to-total capital ratio is 24%. Our free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2013 was $67 million compared with $26.1 million in the prior year.
 We continue to make good progress on improving our working capital position both sequentially and year-over-year. The improvement in free cash flow is attributable to reductions in inventory levels, lower DSOs and less cash required to fund compensation-related obligations. 
 Our inventory levels, as anticipated, have been substantially reduced as compared to the prior year.
 The reduction of over $20 million in SYSTEM 1E-related inventory, driven by shipments of SYSTEM 1E units, contributed significantly to the reduction. In addition, our DSO now at 60 days, has improved by 3 days as compared to the prior year. Capital spending was $29.5 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $15.9 million.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael, and good morning to everyone on the call. Thanks for joining us today, particularly those of you who are in or around New York. I will take some time to review our results from a high-level perspective and then will touch on our recent acquisitions before we open for Q&A.
 We are pleased with our first half performance, despite somewhat weaker than anticipated second quarter revenue. The lower revenue in Q2, we believe, is largely related to the timing of shipments. As we said last quarter, the general trends in our business remain solid although we have seen some softening in our international business, which is offset by continued strength in the United States.
 We continue to see strength in our Healthcare capital segment business in the United States, excluding the impact of SYSTEM 1E. This is reflected in our strong order pattern, which has grown backlog throughout the first half of the year, and October has seen a continuation of that trend. This strength was offset by softening in our international revenue, particularly capital equipment. We believe that both of those trends in Healthcare capital, strength in the United States and softer international sales will likely continue in the second half of our fiscal year.
 Our Healthcare consumables franchise reported 12% growth, driven by our recent acquisition of U.S. Endoscopy and other STERIS consumables, which more than offset the decline in SYSTEM 1 sterilant. More broadly, we are pleased with the progress we are making on integrating U.S. Endoscopy into the STERIS family. The business and the integration process is performing in line with our expectations.
 Let me just cover SYSTEM 1 and 1E briefly as well. As we anticipated, shipments of SYSTEM 1E units have slowed substantially following the end of the transition period. We shipped just over 100 units during the quarter, a substantial decline from the 1,200 shipments in Q2 last year. On the sterilant side, we saw the final decline in S20 shipments for the old SYSTEM 1 processors in the Unites States and ended the quarter down 40% in combined S20/S40 shipments compared with last year.
 As we’ve discussed in the past, we expected the sequential revenue declines in capital and sterilant to end with the August 2 transition date, and we have seen that occur in September and October. We will, however, continue to have tough comparisons for SYSTEM 1 throughout the remainder of this fiscal year.
 Rounding out our discussions on Healthcare. I am confident you’ve seen our announcement a couple of weeks ago regarding the acquisition of Spectrum and Total Repair Express. Spectrum and TRE are leaders in surgical instrument repair and instrument care products to hospitals and surgery centers in the United States. Their core business is the repair of a wide variety of surgical instruments and other hospital equipment, both on-site at hospital premises and at central repair facilities. The primary service offered include inspection, cleaning, lubrication and repair of reusable surgical instruments such as forceps, retractors and scissors. Typical contracts involve regular servicing of instruments in the surgical suite of hospitals and may involve daily or weekly interaction with hospital sterile processing center personnel.
 By utilizing companies like Spectrum and TRE, hospitals may be able to improve operating efficiencies compared with performing those repair functions in-house. 2 businesses are being integrated into our Healthcare segment as part of the specialty service business, which provides a variety of niche services to customers, including space decontamination solutions, chamber cleaning and instrument repair.
 This is a newer part of our organization, and the acquisition of the instrument repair business is a first step in adding scale. In addition, these acquisitions enhance our existing presence in hospital sterile processing and surgical departments. It is early days, but our initial indications of the integration of the 2 new surgical service businesses is also going according to our expectations.
 Turning now to Life Sciences. As we’ve said many times before, the capital equipment revenue in this segment can vary quarter-to-quarter and this past quarter was no exception. Orders and backlog remained strong. And we believe our second quarter revenue comparison to last year is a matter of shipment timing.
 Given our strong backlog and expected order pattern, we continue to anticipate that Life Science will grow revenue in the mid-single digits this year, which based on our first-half performance requires an uptick in shipments in the second half. We remain confident we can achieve those goals. Finally, Isomedix had another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines and remains on track to deliver low double-digit revenue growth for the year as we anticipated. The significant capital and expense investments we have made in capacity and productivity improvements continue to pay off in this business.
 Turning to our outlook. Given our performance in the first half of the year and our capital equipment order trends, we remain confident in our outlook for both adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2013. From a revenue perspective, the addition of Spectrum and TRE will add about 2 percentage points to our revenue growth, which we anticipate will offset continued international weakness, for total company revenue growth in the range of 3% to 4%.
 As Mike has said already, now and going forward, our plan is to provide forecasts on adjusted basis. We believe that our adjusted revenue and earnings provide a clearer picture to shareholders of our ongoing operating results. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook remains in the range of $2.15 to $2.35 that we gave you last quarter, with little impact from Spectrum and TRE this year. And we still expect over half of our EPS to be generated in the second half.
 With the recent additions of Spectrum, TRE and U.S. Endoscopy, we now have approximately $540 million of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Our capital structure remains strong and allows us to continue to make investments in our existing businesses, pay dividends, pursue acquisitions and repurchase shares in a disciplined manner in order to continue to enhance shareholder value.
 With that, I will turn the call back to Mike to begin Q&A. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Walt. Melinda, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Would you please give the instructions and we can get started. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Erin Wilson, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Erin  Wilson: How much did U.S. Endoscopy contribute in the quarter? Or what was that underlying organic Healthcare consumables growth? 
Walter Rosebrough: In terms of revenue, it contributed about $10 million in the quarter. And Mike, I don’t know if you have that other number off the top of your head? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, it -- without the impact of the SYSTEM 1 S20/S40 and without the impact of U.S. Endoscopy, we would have been in low single-digit growth for the other consumables. 
Erin  Wilson: All right. And then, I guess, can you elaborate more on that timing issue on the Life Sciences side? I guess that contributed to some of the weakness that was a little bit surprising. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. Capital equipment’s lumpy in general and Life Science is a smaller business, and as a result - and they’re -- oftentimes, their orders can be in the small millions. So if -- one order that moves from 1 month to the next can make a significant difference in terms of year-over-year comparisons or growth rates. And we’ve seen that historically over long periods of time in the company, so we don’t expect that to change significantly. And this quarter we had a little bit of softness in that regard, but we don’t see it in general. And again, our backlog in Life Science is strong. So it’s not like we don’t have orders, it’s just the timing of the orders didn’t ship in this time period. 
Michael Tokich: Erin, just to give you some perspective, we had 36% growth in capital equipment for Life Sciences in the first quarter. 
Walter Rosebrough: Last quarter. We had a really strong quarter last quarter, a weak quarter this quarter. It comes and it goes a little bit. 
Erin  Wilson: So it, yes, it tends to be lumpy, I guess. All right. And then, I guess, just one last one, I know we’re severely impacted here in the New York City area from the hurricane and the broader storm here, but, I guess, what’s your exposure into any of the impacted areas? And I mean, could this be a net positive, a net negative? How do you view it broadly speaking? 
Walter Rosebrough: As a general statement, I would say we’re not expecting a material difference one way or another. And we don’t know yet enough about our hospital customers’ needs to know if there’s anything significant going on there. We may see, depending on -- - CSSDs tend to be in the basement and, as you guys know, the basements tend to be where the water is. So we just don’t know enough yet to know on that but I wouldn’t expect a material uptick or downtick.
 The area where we are watching carefully is our Isomedix facilities. We do have 4 facilities in the Northeast, all of those we shut down. We shut down the power before the power went out in order to manage it. And 3 of the 4 are still out for power, one is back up. And as they get power, we’re prepared to come back up. We have everything in place, but until the power gets turned back on, we can’t run the facilities obviously. So they’ve been down a couple of days. A few days is not a big deal. We probably won’t do quite as well in October. In fact, I would say we won’t do as well in October, but it has a habit of picking back up in November, December. I would expect, unless this stays longer than people are thinking, I would expect that we pick it back up in the quarter; if not, we may --  I would certainly expect we pick it back up in the year.  And again in terms of our customers, since the geographic sites of Isomedix tend to be aligned with the geographic sites of our customers, their plants are probably down too. So we haven’t seen a disruption in terms of the customer. We’re both down and so we tend to work hand and glove. We don’t see that being a big impact, at least at this point. 
Erin  Wilson: All right. All right. Yes, 1 out of 4 is a lot better than what we’re getting here in New York City, so all right. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. And actually, we have 18 or 19 plants around the country, so it’s not like 3 out of 4 are down.  3 out of 18 are down. 
Operator: The next question is from Chris Cooley with Stephens. 
Christopher Cooley: I appreciate your taking the questions. I apologize if you covered this earlier, hopping between a couple different calls this morning. Mike, maybe could you just parse out what the organic growth rate was for U.S. Endoscopy and kind of what your -- in the current quarter I realize it was maybe a -- basically a month’s contribution there? But kind of help me think about on a go-forward basis, that underlying Healthcare consumables versus the contribution from U.S. Endoscopy. And then I just have a quick follow-up. Hello?
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Walter Rosebrough: Chris, sorry about that. I’m sure you were in the middle of a brilliant question, but I was trying to turn the volume up so I could hear you and I cut you off, I apologize. 
Christopher Cooley: I’ll try and ask the question better this time, not to be put in the box there. I have -- I just apologized, I’ve hopped between a couple different calls this morning, but I was hoping maybe you could parse out. I know you mentioned that U.S. Endoscopy contributed approximately $10 million in the quarter, but could you just talk about the organic growth trends that you’re seeing in that business, albeit on a effectively 1 month run rate and then how we should think about that going forward? And then I just had a quick follow-up after that. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. Chris, we did mention that they’re in-line with our forecasts and we are looking at double-digit increases and that’s where we are. So I wouldn’t -- we don’t feel any differently today, 6 weeks into it than we did back when we did the deal. 
Christopher Cooley: Okay, okay, perfect. And then just following back up on Isomedix. Can you just remind us in terms of where you are in terms of the capacity build out, in terms of when those different plant expansions or new builds are expected to come online? And clearly that’s a gating factor for your growth there, so just help us think about kind of where you are versus the end of the last quarter in that business. And that’s all I have. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Chris. As I mentioned last time, we’re trying to get in -- I think it was last time when we talked about this, we’re trying to be in a mode where we kind of always have some capacity expansion going on, so we don’t see a kind of lumpiness in our capacity expansion. We do have a couple of expansions that we’re working on as we speak. I don’t know that -- we’re not in a significant different space at this point in time than we were a quarter ago, but we do have some expansion going on. And you won’t see that typically, you don’t see that in a big lump because even when a plant goes online, it takes time to fill the plant. What you typically see is some cost increase ahead of the revenue increase. But if we’re growing in the other plants, it tends to equal that out. So at this point, we don’t see any significant variation either direction. 
Operator: The next question is from Greg Halter, Great Lakes Review. 
Gregory Halter: Relative to your commentary about the capital spending, approximately $95 million, when you indicate in the release several major projects, can you talk about any of those that might be larger than others? And then also relative to the CapEx, how much of that is a maintenance of the $95 million? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well first of all, as a -- I’m going to step back, you mentioned talking about the -- we have several projects going on that will take significant capital spending. One, for example, is the fabrication center that we announced probably a year ago. It’s -- we’ve been working on that one a while now. And then we’ve also announced some increase in fabrication in our Montgomery facility.  So those types of capital spending, they’re not expansion per se in terms of expanding product lines, but we’re in-sourcing some of the production of our fabrication and so it’s an expansion in that regard. And so that’s the 2 kind of significant manufacturing ones that we have announced. We actually have a couple more that we’re working on and that are in the future. And Mike, I don’t know if you want to talk about the, if you include Cobalt, our Cobalt purchase for Isomedix, which we consider kind of like routine maintenance, it’s a routine part of the cost structure of that business, where would you put that number? 
Michael Tokich: Yes. In total, Isomedix will probably be around $30-ish million with the expansion with the Cobalt and their normal maintenance. Your question about total, just routine maintenance is probably in the $20 million, $25 million normal. This $95 million is extremely high for us. And as Walt talked about, we do have several different projects, the in-sourcing, the Isomedix expansions, that we are including in this year. So I would say that over time, we’ll get back to more of a normalized level, but maintenance alone is probably about $25 million in total. 
Walter Rosebrough: And some of those -- couple of those projects take -- they don’t end in this fiscal year, they carry over into the next fiscal year. So we do see still some of that spending, but in terms of the expansion capacity. 
Gregory Halter: And that $25 million normal does not include the Cobalt piece or Isomedix, correct? 
Michael Tokich: That is correct. Yes, to me that would be -- that is -- again, timing is everything on that. As we load the plants, the timing of when we load the plants, we could spend anywhere from $15 million to $25 million alone on Cobalt on an annualized basis. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And that fabrication center, that’s the one in Mentor correct, the first one you mentioned? 
Michael Tokich: That is correct. That is correct. 
Gregory Halter: And I noticed that the corporate expense was up about 17% year-over-year to $3.1 million, just wondered if you could comment on what may have caused that? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. Virtually all of our OpEx expense is the addition of U.S. Endoscopy. If you took U.S. Endoscopy out, OpEx is flat to slightly down as I recall. 
Michael Tokich: And the expenses, the acquisition-related expenses. 
Gregory Halter: They’re in that number as well? 
Michael Tokich: Yes. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And you made a comment about the medical device tax of I think it was $0.02 to $0.04, I presume that’s just for 1 quarter so that would annualize out to $0.08 to $0.16 at this time of what you’re thinking? And I know the IRS has yet to define the guidelines on what’s in there. 
Walter Rosebrough: You have that correct. And you’ll note, we have continued to exclude that in this fiscal year because it is only one quarter and because we’re kind of uncertain on what it’s going to be. So we just leave it out there and give you order of magnitude how much it will be. But the following year, if -- presuming it’s promulgated and the law sticks, it would be -- the numbers you’ve described are good numbers. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And what’s your current weighted rate on the debt? And how much is fixed versus variable? 
Michael Tokich: Right now of the -- as of end of September 30, $210 million is fixed and that is our private placement and that is just south of 6% in total and then the remaining piece, $224 million is on our credit facility, which is around 1.5-ish percent, maybe a little bit less than 1.5%. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And one final one, obviously with the couple acquisitions here, just wondering what your appetite is for future acquisitions? 
Walter Rosebrough: As I mentioned in my comments, we still have clearly, that capacity. If anything, we would have rather companies be spread out a little bit more but we don’t get to control the timing. And as I mentioned before, they’re private companies and there’s a, I think, a significant interest this year. If you’re a private company, maybe you get this deal done before the next tax season or next year’s taxes, I should say. So I think that -- well, we know that’s affected of the timing of these. We would rather spread them out a little bit because it is real work and we would be probably less likely to do something in Healthcare than the other 2 units because the Healthcare guys are absorbing 2 as we speak, or really 3, but 2 significant approaches. So that’s kind of where we stand, but we have -- we don’t feel constrained from doing other acquisitions going forward. 
Operator: The next question is from Jose Haresco from JMP Securities. 
Jose Haresco: Just wanted to touch base again on what happened in the Life Sciences segment. So can we assume that this is mostly a European issue, number one? And would you characterize this as a big fundamental change in demand or is this an issue of people -- the demand’s there, but people are taking longer to pay and therefore if you didn’t recognize it in fiscal 2Q, you’ll see it in fiscal 3Q? Or should we just think about kind of the long-term trajectory of Europe a little bit differently? Or is it both? 
Walter Rosebrough: On Life Science, I’ll start. I mean, let me step back to the questions I’m trying to answer. I think you asked 3 pieces. First of all, it had nothing to do with Europe or not significantly in any way to do with Europe. It was a kind of across the board in terms of the shipments. It was international but lot of our business is international, so I wouldn’t read anything into that.  It certainly has nothing to do with payment. The Life Science orders, we book them when the customer takes receipt, not when they take payment. Our payments are good. So it has nothing to do with payment or any lack of payment. It’s just a matter of 1 or 2 orders in Life Science. If they do ship or if the customer does take receipt, they -- it makes a big difference in terms of their total numbers because their numbers are relatively small.  In this particular instance, we happen to have one order that has been -- we ship these from all around the world to all around the world. And we had one particular order where it was shipped quite some time before the end of the quarter. But the ports were backed up so the project is sitting on a boat outside the port, and since the shipment terms are upon receipt at port, we couldn’t book it. So we built it, it was out, everything’s done, everybody wants it to -- a transaction, but we can’t control the ports. So that is the kind of example, it’s just an example of one. But it’s just the timing of significant order that’s all, nothing more or less to be read into it. 
Jose Haresco: Okay.  Kind of staying on the same topic of capital equipment here in the U.S. As you guys think about calendar '13 and perhaps even calendar '14, what are your thoughts or what are clients telling you about CapEx spending cycles in general and the budgets they’re in? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, I haven’t had a whole lot of conversation about calendar '14. I think most people are thinking about is the remainder of calendar '12 and calendar '13. Most of what we see is, and I’m going to use this term loosely, kind of business as usual kind of spending. We have seen, I think, people a little more reticent, if you will. So we’re seeing more people saying, "Hey I’ll spend about the same next year as this year as opposed to a little more." But in general, I think it’s kind of the same or up a little bit is kind of the general thinking. And as we’ve said before, clearly they’re spending significant amounts of capital in the IT area. Clearly they’re spending significant amounts of capital in physician practice and physician office kind of areas. And that does have a bit of a crowding effect, but we’ve been watching that now for a year or 2. We do continue to think that the operating room tends to get a little more preference compared to some of the other capital and so we feel that maybe we’ve not dipped as much as some other areas. And we don’t see that changing significantly at this point in time. But we are cautious, as you know, many people have reported softening in both kinds, both recurring revenue as well as capital equipment. So we’re watching it carefully. But at this point in time, we have not seen that in either our backlog or our order patterns in the -- now speaking about the U.S. 
Operator: The next question is from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. 
Mitra Ramgopal: 2 questions. First, Walter, I was wondering if you could sort of give us your impressions in terms of the SYSTEM 1E unit placements, as to where it is today versus your expectations when the product was first introduced. And is any sort of softness there really due to anything product specific or anything else? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, I have to kind of bifurcate our expectations into 2 buckets. One is SYSTEM 1E, had we had a biological indicator at early launch, which we expected we would get one in early launch; and then once we realized that would not happen. And clearly -- and that’s really the 2 areas. We thought before we launched that if we had a biological indicator and a chemical indicator and the SYSTEM 1E simultaneously or posted simultaneously, we would do 10,000 to 12,000 units.  When it became apparent we would not, and we literally had to launch the products without a biological indicator or now what is called a sports idles test strip, a different type of -- an indicator with a different clearance, when we realized that, we cut our expectations roughly in half to about 6,000 units and that’s where we ended up. So ballpark here is had we known at the time we would not have that indicator, I suspect -- in fact, if anything, had we known at the time, we probably would have forecast less. We were pleased vis-à-vis, but we thought it might be without a biological indicator if you could go back 18 months or 24 months. But by the time we kind of got around to that, we’d seen customers willing to buy without that indicator, so we’re essentially on our expectations. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And again that issue is pretty much behind you now in that there is no way U.S... 
Walter Rosebrough: The units are out there, we’re done, I -- we don’t see -- as I said I think several times, we don’t see a radical increase in unit placements going forward nor do we see a radical reduction of placements going forward. And things right now are tracking about as we would expect. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. And secondly on acquisitions, you’ve done about 3 sizable transactions over the past 7 months. I was wondering if it’s more a question of things coming together at this point in time or is it sort of a way of trying to offset some of the declines as a result of SYSTEM 1? 
Walter Rosebrough: No. In short, the first part of your answer is correct, it just came together. Again, I’ve mentioned to many of you that when I came in about 5 years ago, I thought we had plenty of internal work to do working our organic business, and so we really focused on that the first couple of years. We pretty much shut down the pipeline for business development, only leaving it open for non-U.S. acquisitions while we did some work internally. We got through that work in couple of years ago now, probably 2.5 years ago, we beefed up our BD group again and said turn them loose to start looking for things that fit what we were doing.  And it takes time to have that process work and we’re methodical. There we saw some things that might have been interesting but we didn’t want to pay the prices. We saw some things that might have been interesting, we changed -- we decided not to move forward with it. And it just so happened a couple that we were very interested in, these -- the 2 generic areas in the endoscopy area and in the specialty service area were our top 2 targets in our Healthcare business.  And we just got lucky that the companies that we were interested in became available for sale. They’re private companies, we didn’t control the timing. We’d have loved to have done both of them a year ago. I’d rather done only one of them 1.5 years ago and one of them 6 months ago. But we don’t control the timing, it just worked out and that’s the way it worked out. So it has nothing to do with the SYSTEM 1 issues. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. And again, the guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions, I take it? 
Walter Rosebrough: That is correct, Mitra, yes. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Bob Goldman, C.L. King. 
Robert Goldman: I’m dealing with a few logistical things on my end, so if these questions were asked and answered I apologize and just tell me and I’ll read the transcript. But going back to capital equipment, Walt, I think you said that you expected for the second half of the year some maintenance of the trend we saw in the quarter, which was relative strength in Healthcare capital equipment and relative weakness in the international capital equipment.  In international, based on an answer to a question that you provided, it sounded like you’re thinking it’s more of a timing issue with Life Science. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. 
Robert Goldman: On the other hand, you did say you thought the second half would continue, I forget your exact words, but I thought weak with Life Science capital equipment. Could you just reconcile that for me? And then I’ve got a follow-up on Healthcare. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Bob, I may not have been as clear as I could have. Let me separate first and talk about Healthcare and then talk about Life Science. In Healthcare is where we saw what you’ve correctly described as relative strength in the U.S. and relative weakness in international and that is our go-forward expectation. Life Science, we had a weak quarter, we had a solid first half, we had a weak quarter, but we still have to do more in the second half and we expect to do that. So Life Science, we expect strength kind of across the board in the go-forward 6 months. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. And then the follow-up on Healthcare, in this relative strength in the U.S., it sounded like an answer to another question that operating room products might have been strong. Outside of that, what were some of the other products that showed some good strength and which ones do you expect to continue showing relative strength in the second half of the year? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, Bob, and I probably should be more careful with my language, when I say operating room I’m really talking about the entire perioperative loop, which includes CSSD and that effectively is all of our capital products.  So we happen to -- all of our capital products are in that space of OR and CSSD or central sterile. So I was characterizing -- I was talking about, again, I think it’s pretty clear that in hospitals or in healthcare systems, the IT spending is very strong, the physician and physician -- acquisition of physician practice and things like that are strong. And then in the balance, if you think of the rest of their spending, it seems like the OR is holding -- OR and CSSD combined are holding up a little better, if you will, than the balance. That was my only comment. We’re not certain of that because we don’t see all the other spending, but it appears that way to us. And if you look at -- there are some people that are looking at this and they seem to corroborate that conversation. 
Robert Goldman: And if I can, finally on that and I don’t know to what level of granularity you’re comfortable with, but I might have thought for instance the V-PRO would be continuing to pick up share and contributed to strength. But are there a few products like that, that you’re able to cite that are particularly strong right now? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, you’re correct. If you look across our product lines, I can almost say generically speaking our newer products are doing better than our older products, if you will. And V-PRO is clearly one of those, the OR integration products clearly continue in that path. On the capital side, Life's continue to be strong. So it’s more across the board, but our newer products do continue to strengthen and V-PRO is clearly one of those. 
Operator: I’m showing no further questions on the phone lines. 
Michael Tokich: Great. Thank you, Melinda. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We will talk to you again next quarter. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2013 Q1  (2012-08-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the STERIS Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At the request of STERIS, today's call will be recorded for instant replay. I'd now like to introduce today's host, Julie Winter, Director, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.

 With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our first quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Walt will provide further perspective on the quarter as well as provide detail regarding our outlook for the full fiscal year.
 Before I start reviewing our first quarter results, I'd like to point out that beginning this quarter and going forward, we have made a decision to report earnings per diluted share on both a U.S. GAAP basis as well as on an adjusted basis. Our adjusted earnings per share calculation will exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition related transaction and integration costs, as well as certain other items.
 We believe that the adjusted earnings measurement will provide additional meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and in assessing our future performance. As Julie already indicated, included in our press release this morning is an adjusted earnings reconciliation table for both the first quarter and full year of both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013.
 With that, I'll now start with the review of our first quarter results.
 Total revenue grew 6% for the quarter, driven by a 5% increase in volume, a 1% increase from acquisitions, and a 1% improvement in pricing offset by a 1% negative impact from currency fluctuations. Gross margin in the quarter declined 100 basis points to 40.7%. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 40% reduction in the combined S20/S40 sterilant volumes. On a positive note, if you were to exclude the negative impact from our U.S. SYSTEM 1 and 1E business, the rest of our business actually expanded gross margin by more than 100 basis points.
 EBIT for the quarter increased $1.4 million to $48.3 million. EBIT, as a percent of revenue, for the quarter was 14.3%, a slight decrease from last year caused by the decline in gross margin. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.4% compared with 34.4% last year. Net income at $30.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with $28.7 million or $0.48 per diluted share last year. On an adjusted earnings basis, earnings per diluted share were $0.53 compared with $.50 last year.
 Moving on to our segment results. Healthcare revenue in the quarter grew 3%. Capital equipment revenue grew 7% with growth occurring in both infection prevention and surgical products. Service revenues increased 3% with growth occurring in capital equipment installations and service contract revenue. Consumable revenue decreased 5% as continued reductions in the combined S20/S40 sterilant volumes more than offset growth in other consumables. Excluding the S20/S40 sterilant volume decline, consumable revenue actually increased mid-single digits.
 Healthcare backlog in the quarter was $99.4 million, a decline of 26%. Given where we are in the SYSTEM 1 transition process, our SYSTEM 1E backlog as anticipated has been substantially reduced. Healthcare backlog excluding SYSTEM 1E declined 12% versus the prior year, but increased 7% sequentially.
 Healthcare operating margin in the quarter was 9.9% of revenue. Several factors are impacting healthcare's operating margin including the reduction in the combined S20/S40 sterilant volumes, the timing of R&D spending along with higher expenses related to System 1E uptime reliability as compared to the prior year. We've experienced a sequential decrease in expenses related to System 1E. But as you may recall, the expenses related to the System 1E uptime reliability increased sequentially on a quarterly basis last year, with Q1 being the low point.
 Life Sciences revenue increased 14% in the quarter. Capital equipment revenue grew 36%, consumable revenue grew 4% and service revenue grew 3%. The strong increase in capital equipment revenue continued to be driven by replacement orders from our pharmaceutical customers.
 Backlog in Life Sciences was $47.4 million at the end of the quarter, increasing slightly as compared with last year. Life Sciences operating margin increased to 19.6%. The operating margin expansion was a result of volume increases and improved operating efficiencies.
 Revenue for Isomedix increased 10% in the quarter, we continue to experience solid demand for -- from our core medical device customers. In addition, our recent acquisition of Biotest added approximately 400 basis points of revenue growth to the Isomedix segment. Isomedix operating margin increased to 33.8% of revenue as a result of increased revenue volumes. Although we are happy to see this level of operating margin, we do not believe that this rate is sustainable.
 Terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $186.7 million of cash and $210 million long-term debt. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $45.7 million compared with negative $3.6 million in the prior year.
 We continue to make good progress on improving our working capital position, both sequentially and year-over-year. The improvement in free cash flow is attributable to reductions in inventory levels, lower DSOs, and less cash required to fund compensation related obligations.
 Our inventory levels, as anticipated, have been substantially reduced as compared to the prior year. Specifically, the reduction of over $28 million in SYSTEM 1E related inventory, driven by shipments of SYSTEM 1E units over the past 12 months. In addition, our DSO at 64 days has improved versus the prior year. Our key activity in the quarter included the collection of approximately $6 million from Spanish government-owned hospitals.
 Our accounts receivable balance at $246 million does not include $15 million of pending credits related to our SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program. If AR would be adjusted for those credits, our DSO will improve by another 4 days to 60 days. Capital spending was $15.5 million in the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $14.3 million.
 With that, I'll now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael. Good morning, and thanks to everyone on the call. We are pleased with the strong first quarter with growth across all 3 business segments and profit results ahead of our expectations. The general trends in our business remains solid with revenue growth in line with our expectations in Life Science and Isomedics, including contribution from the acquisition of Biotest.
 Our healthcare segment excluding SYSTEM 1 and SYSTEM 1E, also delivered good growth, in particular from newer products, and we anticipate that will continue. As you know, shipments of S20 sterilant and support of SYSTEM 1 units in the U.S. ends today. It has been a long, expensive and challenging road, but I'm proud of the way our people have worked to support our customers and assist them in making this transition.
 In many ways, we are glad to put this chapter behind us. As you might imagine given the timing of our transition deadline, we shipped over 700 SYSTEM 1E units in the quarter. Through the end of June, we have now shipped about 6,000 SYSTEM 1E units since the introduction of the product a couple of years ago, which is in line with our expectations.
 We believe that we have shipped the majority of units that will be sold this fiscal year in the U.S. and we have nearly achieved our United States SYSTEM 1E unit volume projection for the year. Even though that is good news, it does mean that we have somewhat tougher year-over-year comparisons the next few quarters, as we were actively shipping units all last year.
 We are seeing S20 sterilant continue the expected decline in the United States, which will be flatlining after today. But the new S40 Sterilant has ramped up from quarter-to-quarter, so the net shipments of S20 and S40 is in line with our forecast. As you know, we have given a range of ongoing sterilant sales in the U.S. versus our sales before the transition started, at about 30% to 40% of our historic volume.
 It appears that our going forward sterilant revenue will be in the midpoint of that range. We have completed our software update for SYSTEM 1E in the field and as anticipated, has seen a significant decline in the number of service requests due to unit downtime. Consequently, our SYSTEM 1E field costs are tracking to our forecast. As Mike indicated, the end result of all these activities is a nice reduction in our expenses compared with the fourth quarter levels and we are on our plan to reduce that cost even further.
 We have officially launched our support tester for S1E and we will begin shipping during the second quarter. And our customers have also widely adopted the use of our chemical indicator. These optional accessory products do not translate into big revenue dollars, but they are important to many of our customers and thus important to us.
 Outside of the SYSTEM 1 franchise, healthcare had a good quarter and specifically for several of our newer products, [indiscernible] cleaning chemistries, the new IQ 3000 integrated OR, our value line of LED lighting, the 4085 surgical tables and VPRO MAX. We have recently received key endorsements for VPRO MAX from industry partners including Olympus for their endoscopes.
 As you all know, we recently announced a proposed acquisition of U.S. Endoscopy, which should close this quarter. Even though we will only have a partial year impact from the business, it is sizable enough for us to update our revenue outlook for FY '13. We now anticipate total company revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4% compared with our prior expectations of flat revenues for the year, largely a result of the acquisition.
 Similarly, healthcare segment revenue is expected to grow low single-digits compared with previous expectations of a decline in revenue of low single-digits. The revenue outlook for Life Science and Isomedix are unchanged.
 As Mike has already mentioned, going forward, we will provide you as GAAP earnings per share as well as adjusted earnings per share for the full fiscal year. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we are maintaining our outlook for earnings per diluted share in the range of $2 to $2.20 for fiscal 2013, which now includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from the U.S. Endoscopy acquisition on a GAAP basis.
 Adjusted earnings per diluted share are anticipated to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.35 including accretion of approximately $0.05 per share from the acquisition of U.S. Endoscopy. This compares with adjusted earnings per share last year of $2.22 on the same basis. Give our success in Q1, we now anticipate more like a 45-55, first half-second half split in EPS.
 For the full fiscal 2013, free cash flow is now anticipated to be approximately $130 million, excluding SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program and class action settlements or $90 million including these items. We have increased our estimate of free cash flow by $10 million to reflect our first quarter performance. We are confident in our free cash flow generation and continue to believe that we have capacity to fund additional investments in order to grow the business. We expect longer-term annual free cash flow to be in the $125 million to $150 million.
 Our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. We continue to increase our dividend over time. In fact, our board just approved our seventh consecutive double-digit percentage increase in the dividend today. We will now pay $0.19 per share per quarter, which is about 2.5% yield based on our recent stock trading range.
 And we are continuing our investments in our business including new product development, investment and capacity expansion, and our in-sourcing projects. By manufacturing more of our critical components, we believe we will improve quality, provide enhanced service to our customers and lower our costs. We also plan to invest in adjacent businesses that we find appealing through acquisition.
 We have not repurchased stock so far this fiscal year as our existing 10b5-1 plan had expired at the end of fiscal '12. And we wanted to avoid any appearance of impropriety since we had inside knowledge regarding the U.S. Endoscopy acquisition.
 However, we have approximately $118 million remaining on our existing authorization, and you should not be surprised if we're back in the market this year. We firmly believe that the results of all our efforts will continue to create value for our customers, our people and our shareholders in the years to come.
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A session. So Jane, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens. 
Christopher Cooley: Could you help us out when we look at the Life Sciences business and specifically the capital line item, help us think about volume growth there, relative to pricing. And really what I'm just trying to get out there is, are you seeing -- are these larger transactions or are the aggregate volumes up significantly? And I just have a follow-up. 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Chris. I would characterize it not as larger individual transactions typically. Typically the large projects -- if someone builds a new plan or refurbishes an entire plan something like that is the large transaction kind of volume. It's in fact just the opposite -- it has been now for couple of years. We've seen the replacement business to kind of one off -- "I need this sterilizer or I need that hydrogen peroxide device". It's more of a replacement business, more one-off relatively speaking in the business, and it's not a function of pricing other than, as you know, a couple years ago. We quit chasing very low priced, low profit business. So in that regard, by not chasing unprofitable business, I suppose pricing has come up and that's why our business size shrunk early on in that process, but since then it's been a steady feed of replacement type products and our newer products, like the hydrogen peroxide products I've mentioned earlier. 
Christopher Cooley: Okay, super. Obviously we, here just a few weeks back, we thought about U.S. Endoscopy [indiscernible] use of the balance sheet there, to kind of help accelerate organic growth of business going forward. Help me think about other product areas or other that are either internally developed that we should be looking forward to as the year progresses or maybe other areas where the company might be complementary, but not in the portfolio today. Just so that we can kind of think about that that what could be in terms of both growth and profitability for the company as we go to the fiscal year and beyond. Thanks so much. 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Chris. Not unlike our product development projects, we don't really talk about new products before we launch them and we also don't really talk about new acquisition areas before we launch them or do them, but the easiest way to think about it is that, I've mentioned many times is that, we are unlikely to take that leap where we have a product in a place that we don't know or a -- so we don't like new products in new places, new products in new markets. We would generally like to see products that we are already involved with in new markets or where we're already have involvement, we bring products into place and thus the U.S. Endoscopy's a classic, as we are in that area with a different set of products. We are not in the procedural component of that area. We think there is a nice fit there, that they will enhance us in the backroom, if you will and clearly it's in a new area in the front room, so that's the kind of thing if you just kind of look at our product set and say "what's right next door to it?" That would be the classic place for us to go. 
Operator: Our next question is from Greg Halter, Great Lakes Review. 
Gregory Halter: I'm wondering if you could comment on the performance over in Europe, specifically breaking down east and western parts and what you're seeing there relative to the market as well as how you did in the quarter? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, you will -- the quarter kind of year-over-year, we did about the same, I mean, it's plus or minus I don't remember exactly, but plus 0.01 or 0.02 or minus 0.01 or 0.02, and I just don't remember off the top of my head. In revenue, we don't comment on profitability, but I will say that we've done a lot of restructuring in Europe the last couple of years and that restructuring is paying off. So, our profitability has clearly improved over there. Relative to your question about kind of within or in what areas in Europe, we are seeing, I think probably what most people would expect Western Europe or particularly southern Western Europe is weaker relatively speaking, and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and parts of Northern Europe are stronger, relatively speaking, and so that's generally what we've seen, but we had a good -- solid quarter in Europe this last quarter. We were very happy to see the payments out of Spain that Mike mentioned and we continue to see a pipeline in our European business. So, although we are watching them and are concerned about Europe is a general statement. So far our business is nicely holding their own over there. 
Gregory Halter: And do you have any other larger receivables that you're waiting on from -- similar to the Spanish situation? 
Walter Rosebrough: The answer is as you know the countries of the world have their own natural rhythm of payments and Spain is a historic slow paying country as a general rule is just they got way worse. Italy is another country that is a relatively speaking slow payment country, but we are not seeing them getting -- they look like Italy has looked to us for the last 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 years. So, it relatively speaking, they are slower pay than some other places. But we're not seeing at this point that Spain had clearly gotten long, but I would say as a general statement around the world. We're not seeing anybody that's out of line with their normal payment practice. 
Gregory Halter: Okay, that's excellent news. The Biotest, obviously you had it for the quarter, I just wonder how that's performing versus your expectations? 
Walter Rosebrough: We like what we've seen. It's real early and there is always going to be something you don't plan for, I mean that's a rule of life, but so far we like what we see. 
Gregory Halter: Okay. And just wondering if you will be providing the adjusted non-GAAP numbers on a quarterly basis, I know you gave the $2.22 and the $0.50 for the first quarter, but just wondering how the other 3 quarters of fiscal 2012 played out. 
Michael Tokich: Yes, great. We could actually provide those, we did not provide those today but that's something actually we can have Julie put on our website so that we can have it disclosed for the second, third, fourth quarters. We gave you the first quarter and the full year, but we can actually put the quarterly amounts out there in the next day or 2. 
Gregory Halter: It basically looks like it's about $0.01 a share for the next 3 quarters, maybe one of them is $0.02 though, just doing the math? 
Michael Tokich: That's approximately. I don't have it in front of me but, yes, that's exactly right. 
Gregory Halter: All right. And one last one, given the pending acquisition of the company there right next door to you guys, I'm wondering what's going to happen to your $200 million in debt that you currently have, is that something that you can renegotiate or will that just be termed out and paid starting, I guess 2013 is the first tranche? 
Michael Tokich: Yes. Greg, that $210 million is our private placement funding, actually we did 2 tranches -- 2 separate tranches over the last couple of years. That we'll maintain and that will just be termed out over the next, I think the first payment is next year and then subsequently a couple of years out. So, we will just continue down that path. Now what you will see upon the close of U.S. Endoscopy is, we will have a borrowing against our credit line, our facility line to help pay for that, but that will be the change in debt that you will see that $210 million remains and will be termed over the normal course of that agreement. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. 
Mitra Ramgopal: First is a quick question on the guidance, does it assume in the fourth quarter, any impact on the medical device tax? 
Michael Tokich: No. We have continued, Mitra, as we did at the beginning of the year to exclude that activity and as we've said in the guidance that, that could have an impact of $0.02 to $0.04. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And just going back again to the strength you saw in the healthcare business, I mean I think the sentiment is that the economy might be slowing again, et cetera, but certainly you feel encouraged in terms of the flat revenue you're initially expecting now to low mid-single digits, is there anything in particular you're seeing that kind of leads to the increased confidence? 
Walter Rosebrough: Mitra, what we saw if you kind of go back over the last 2 or 3 years, what we saw is the replacement kind of business in the operating room, really kind of fell off and big projects were included if you remember, a couple of years ago, we were saying our big project numbers had really grown and then they kind of shifted, they weren't growing so much. We're accessing less projects at bigger size. And now what we're seeing is more replacement on a kind of percentage basis, we're seeing more though, buy 2 replacement tables and buy 2 replacement sterilizers as opposed to the big projects. So we've seen a shift back more towards, I don't know about normal levels but clearly we're shifting -- had shifted more back towards replacement. And I suspect we have some pent-up demand there, people kind of slowed down their replacement cycle and now the replacements are coming back in the big projects, but then that happens over the course of time kind of shifting back and forth, so that would be the main thing that we've seen so far. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And again you're counting on, you intention [ph] the growth being volume driven as opposed to any meaningful pricing benefit? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, we don't expect like a 10% price increase or anything, no. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And finally just a quick question on the cash, again clearly bumping up the dividend, potentially buying back shares, and keeping cash in terms of acquisitions. I guess it's fair to assume all 3 are in play or is there any particular area you're going to be more willing to deploy the cash? 
Walter Rosebrough: We've said in rank order, we don't anticipate reducing our dividend in fact we anticipate increasing it overtime. The second component is we're going to invest in the businesses we already have. So, as you've seen there's a number of -- this year particularly, this next 18 to 24 months we're making some significant investments in those businesses in the capital side. The third is if we see adjacent areas that we think we can grow and/or see synergies through acquisition and then the fourth is stock buyback. And we feel the same way, we have -- we've been saying that now for, I don't know, 3, 4, or 5 years. The difference is 4 or 5 years ago we shutdown the acquisition machine. We thought we had more opportunity working on our business. And a couple of years ago we said we're going to start looking and we think patiently and cautiously, but looking for things that make sense for us and things just take time. We just happened to -- this just happened -- to fruition now, we can't control the timing of those kinds of things. So, that's -- but it's a same thought process, same approach and we continue down that same path. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And again I know you can't be specific on acquisitions, but given the current environment, are you seeing more opportunities out there or pretty much the same it's been the past few years? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, clearly on the private company side of the world, this little tax thing that everybody's worried about come January 1, clearly has an impact on private company type companies because if they can assure themselves the capital gain at current capital gains rates as opposed to God only knows what it's going to be next year. You're clearly seeing that. Other than that I would say no significant change. 
Operator: Our next question comes from José Haresco with JMP Securities. 
Jose Haresco: So just a few housekeeping questions, I believe you said that you sold a little over 700 SYSTEM 1E units in the quarter. 
Walter Rosebrough: That's correct. 
Jose Haresco: Okay. For the remainder of the fiscal year then, should we think about those core replacements as being level of what you guys use to sell prior to that whole transition period or are we still going to see some fairly bulky orders in the 50 to 100 or is it per quarter, actually think about the rest of the year. 
Michael Tokich: Let me tell you that guidance that we have given, we said that we expected about 5,200 units in total, total, total, total, and we've said now we are at 6,000, that should give you a -- and we are not feeling differently. So, that should give you fairly good deal, that's U.S. Our non-U.S. business should do what it has done. So, there is some non U.S., obviously some non U.S. sales of various SYSTEM 1 devices, so -- but that gives you order of magnitude. 
Jose Haresco: Okay. I think I've asked you this before, but can you remind us of how you think about kind of the on-going cost associated with the transition -- perhaps you can categorize those for us, and I know you're still thinking that fiscal '14 will be the first "clean" year where everything will be behind you in terms of cost? 
Walter Rosebrough: I'm going to answer the first question, but the second question first that is yes, fiscal '14 will be the first year we have kind of the clean year. We will still have some back -- there will be comparative issues going on in terms of everything that's happened in '13. The excess cost will go away obviously but then the sale of the units will also go away, so there is some offsets there. So for comparison '13 to '14, we have to look at them kind of one at a time, but it is -- but we expect we'll be -- have a clean year in '14. We still feel the same way. Mike, I don't know if you want to comment on, I'll call it the buckets, but I can tell you we are not feeling any differently about those than our original guidance. 
Jose Haresco: Okay. And I guess lastly on the latest acquisition. And I just had the chance here to think about where the structural synergies are going to be in terms of how much of the other organization will be brought into kind of the [indiscernible] hold or how much of R&D in sales in organizations will -- have been dependent, so to speak? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, again I'll characterize it as I did before, the -- this is not a "huge cost reduction synergy acquisition". This is a "how do we grow faster in both businesses and not have -- and STERIS not have to invest in the new sales force acquisition", because they already have one. And so, this is more of an upside revenue and growth synergy question than it is a "Oh gee, that we're going to cut half of the people out of the company". We're not going to do that. Now will there be some modest cost reductions? Absolutely, they always are. Will we apply the same kind of thought processes about cost we do in all of our businesses? We think we're fairly cost conscious and we will apply that same logic in this business and the best and easiest places to get real cost reduction is businesses are growing, because those cost reductions don't entail laying people off and closing factories and all that stuff. They entail doing more with the same number of people. So that's -- we're more interested in those kind of synergies, if you will, than "Gee, is one accounts payable clerk going away?"  or something like that. Again, some of that type of thinking may -- some of that thing might happen, but we don't see that being the driving force. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There is follow up question from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review. 
Gregory Halter: We've heard from some of our other companies that we cover on the hospital area -- hospital spending and so forth, I just wondered what your thoughts are given that particular topic? 
Walter Rosebrough: Are you talking about general spending or capital spending, Greg? 
Gregory Halter: Probably both. Separately, if you could. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, clearly on the consumable side, the consumables tend to track procedure volumes, and we've seen procedural volumes kind of bouncing around a little bit. They're clearly not growing the way they were 4 or 5 years ago, but procedure volumes haven't had a drastic decline on anything, so we're still kind of viewing that low single-digit growth rate as the kind of growth that we're seeing on unit basis. And then on the capital side, you do have to differentiate different pieces of the market and although there is clearly, I mean there is clearly pressure on hospitals, everybody understands that, but they're spending like crazy in IT when they're not spending like crazy in something else, but most of the things that we are seeing, is that they're still saying they're kind of in their current spending levels, they're not planning on growing a lot. There are people that are reducing, there are people that are increasing, but kind of current spending levels are more what we're seeing and as we've mentioned on several occasions, the operating room tends to be a little more resilient than other areas of capital spending, and we saw that a couple of years ago. Now of course, everybody went way down and we just went down less, we being the operating room itself, not necessarily us. And so, we still think it is a bit more resilient than other areas and as I mentioned we're seeing what could be some pent up demand on the replacement side. So to date, we're seeing capital spending kind of holding its own. It's not like we're seeing a gold rush or anything, but we have not seen significant decline, our orders were actually quite strong this last quarter, and we still see pipeline. So that's kind of where we are. We are cautiously watching it like everyone is in this business, but to date we haven't seen significant declines. 
Gregory Halter: Okay, that's excellent. And one last one, I may have asked this when you did the acquisition call, but on capital spending thoughts for STERIS, I'm assuming the transaction is completed. What would you estimate that in a range for fiscal 2013? 
Michael Tokich: Greg, we're still anticipating approximately $85 million of capital expenditures for the year and that's even with the acquisition of U.S. Endoscopy, their capital requirements are minimum -- minimal, if anything. 
Walter Rosebrough: We don't have to build buildings. We've -- like every manufacturer, you have to buy machines now and then, but it's not -- we don't see like we have to build new building or build a new factory, those kind of things. 
Gregory Halter: And of that $85 million, how much of it would be just maintenance or for the Isomedix unit versus expansion. 
Michael Tokich: Isomedix typically runs about $20 million to $25 million in total for cobalt and maintenance. I would consider cobalt part of their maintenance process. 
Operator: We have another question from the Chris Cooley with Stephens. 
Christopher Cooley: Could you just help us think about Isomedix going forward just from a growth perspective, 11.5%. I'm sorry -- 9.5% there in the quarter on a reported basis, if we think about you've expanded capacity there over the course of the last fiscal year. Should we think about the base Isomedix business now kind of being in that 5% to 7% range and then Biotest being incremental above that or just to kind of help us think about what's a more normalized growth rate for the Isomedix franchise going forward? Thanks. 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure, Chris. We've said, generally speaking, that market is the mid-single digits kind of market. We're always hoping to pick up a point or 2 a share. Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't, but we're always shooting for it. So, the kind of numbers you're describing are in the right range anyway. I should add, as you correctly mentioned, we did bring a lot of capacity on the last couple of years. We are continuing to bring capacity on and we've discussed that before, but we have another growth in capacity in the Northeast coming online, either next quarter or the quarter after. But we think probably this coming quarter and then we have some more capacity coming on in the Southwest next -- a year from now kind of timeframe. So, we continue to bring capacity online and that's why Mike mentioned about the earnings, when you bring capacity online it's a good thing for the long-run, but the short-run you do see a little bit dip and that's part of the deal. 
Christopher Cooley: Understood. And may be just a follow-up to that, when you think about Biotest, is that the right run rate to think about for them what we saw this quarter or I'm just trying to think about how to model that going forward? Thanks so much. 
Walter Rosebrough: I think this quarter is a reasonable estimate. 
Operator: We have a question from Robert Goldman from CL King. 
Robert Goldman: I'm a bit late in jumping on the call, so I apologize and if any of these questions were asked, just tell me, Walt, then I'll refer myself to the transcript. But I do have a couple. The Life Science sales was exceptionally stronger than I've been looking for. I suspect you've already covered, but want to ask was there anything unique to the quarter that would suggest you don't get similarly strong growth throughout the year or are we at the point in the cycle where we shouldn't be expecting similarly strong growth through the year? 
Walter Rosebrough: Bob, our best look at that is our guidance for the year and I would refer you to that. We did have a strong quarter at capital as you, particularly in Life Science can be a little lumpy and we had a nice lump in this quarter. Our guidance for the year is, we feel comfortable with that guidance. 
Robert Goldman: I'm just trying frankly to fair it out if it's conservative guidance or you've got enough sort of -- look in to the pipeline, you just know that the lumps aren't there. 
Walter Rosebrough: That's a great question, Bob. We would never have overly conservative guidance. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. Let me ask a few other pieces of that. 
Walter Rosebrough: We feel good about our guidance in Life Science, that's the best answer, and they do have, as you can see, they have a nice backlog, and it is lumpy though and some of that backlog is out there a way. So, I think our guidance is the best -- kind of the best place to be in Life Science right now. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. And a couple other things. In your earnings guidance, you've not included the medical device excise tax, although you did suggest what the impact could be. Curious why you have not included that in the guidance. Is there an assumption that you can offset that tax with cost reduction or price increases or what's the rationale? 
Walter Rosebrough: Bob, the rationale was particularly when we were looking at it originally when we did this guidance was there was a fair amount of uncertainty about what was going to happen to the tax. I still think there is uncertainty about what is going to happen to the tax. And so we're going to let the political system do its thing and sort it out. So, it's not a presumption that we can somehow offset that entire tax in 5 minutes, that would be an incorrect presumption, either by prices or by cost reductions. So it's not the presumption, and since it only impacts a quarter of our business in this fiscal year. We chose to leave it out, let the politicians have their say, and then we will act accordingly, and that's why we left it out explicitly, but also gave you explicitly a reasonable range of what impact that could have. And so if you want to prognosticate the politicians better than us. We want to allow you to do that. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. And then a couple of other things. Obviously, I saw your annual guidance, did you suggest any sort of a gating quarter-by-quarter for the year or could you give us any guidance on that? 
Walter Rosebrough: We did say -- obviously we're a little strong in the first quarter and we did talk about the fact in my comments, I mentioned that we're expecting more of a 45-55 split as opposed to our original guidance was a 40-60. 
Robert Goldman: Okay and then my final question is on the cash flow. I'm trying to think through what the proper free cash flow base is for 2013, as I think beyond 2013, is it $90 million or is it $130 million? 
Walter Rosebrough: Again, that's in my script, Bob. But we're thinking our -- not so much '13, but let's say '13, '14, '15 kind of numbers in the $130 million to $150 million range. 
Robert Goldman: $130 million to $150 million, you'd say? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, Bob, the difference... 
Walter Rosebrough: I think I said $125 million, Bob, but so $125 million to $150 million, $130 million is in there somewhere. I'm being slapped, Bob. 
Michael Tokich: Bob, I just want to add one thing. The difference between the $90 million and $130 million is the payments associated with the rebate program and class action, so the $90 million includes it, the $130 million excludes it. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. And we're not looking to do another one of those, Bob. 
Michael Tokich: Yes. 
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back now for closing remarks. 
Julie Winter: Great, thanks, Jane. Thanks, everybody, for joining us and we'll talk to you again next quarter. 
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2012 Q4  (2012-05-08 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the STERIS Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At the request of STERIS, today’s call will be recorded for instant replay. I’d now like to introduce today’s host, Julie Winter, Director Investor Relations. Ma’am, you may begin. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Kaylin, and good morning, everyone. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to STERIS's Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. As usual, participating in the call this morning are Walt Rosebrough, our President and CEO, and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO.

 With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure again to be with you this morning to review our fourth quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Walt will provide a recap of our full fiscal year results, along with a summary of our outlook for fiscal year 2013.
 As you saw this morning in our earnings announcement, during the quarter we adjusted a portion of our original SYSTEM 1 rebate program liability. The total pre-tax adjustment was $17.4 million, of which $15.3 million is attributable to the customer rebate portion of the program, and was recorded as an increase to revenue. And $2.1 million is attributable to the disposal costs related to the SYSTEM 1 units to be returned and was recorded as a reduction in cost of revenue.
 In addition, during the quarter we have reserved $3 million of inventory for certain SYSTEM 1E components. These components can no longer be utilized due to the most recent special 510K clearance which contained a modification of the UV light intensity threshold. And finally, restructuring was $0.8 million favorable during the quarter.
 My comments as well as Walt’s comments on the full year performance will exclude all 3 of these factors in an effort to assist you in comparing results with the prior year. In addition, for fiscal year 2011, both Walt and I will also exclude the impact of the original SYSTEM 1 rebate program liability, the class action lawsuit settlement liability, as well as restructuring expenses. Please see today’s earnings announcement for a complete reconciliation to GAAP numbers. I will now begin with a review of the income statement.
 Total revenue declined 1% versus last year’s fourth quarter. Pricing improved 0.9% and we experienced a 0.8% favorable impact from our acquisition of Sercon. Both of these items were more than offset by a 2% decline in volume along with a negative 0.4% impact from currency fluctuations. The decline in volume is attributable to fewer SYSTEM 1E shipments in the quarter versus the prior year along with the continued decline of S20 volumes.
 Now if you exclude SYSTEM 1 and SYSTEM 1E revenue in the United States in both periods, total company revenue in the quarter would have increased 4%. Gross margin in the quarter declined 160 basis points to 39.7%. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to a 44% reduction in the combined S20/S40 volumes. On a positive note, we continue to experience improvements in gross margin within both our Life Sciences and Isomedix segments.
 EBIT for the quarter increased slightly, primarily as a result of lower SG&A expenses. As we told you last quarter, we were anticipating about $7 million in expenses related to our product reliability and consolidation programs during the quarter. Our actual expenses in the quarter came in at $6 million for a total of $23 million for the full fiscal year. As you know, we have had some offsets to those expenses, most notably our bonus costs.
 As we discussed last quarter, given our earnings in fiscal year 2012, we will not be paying bonuses as part of our annual incentive compensation plan. As a result, we have reduced our compensation expense by $4 million in the quarter and $12 million in the full fiscal year. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.3% compared with 34% last year. The higher effective tax rate in the quarter is due to a discrete item adjustment recorded in the quarter. Net income was $34.3 million or $0.59 per diluted share compared with net income of $36.4 million or $0.61 per diluted share last year.
 Moving on to our segment results; in healthcare our service revenue grew 4%, due to increases in maintenance contract revenue for SYSTEM 1E units. Capital equipment revenue in the quarter grew 1%. If you exclude the decline in SYSTEM 1E capital shipments year-over-year, the rest of our Healthcare segment capital equipment revenue grew 7%, as we experienced double-digit growth in our Infection Prevention products and mid-single digit growth in our surgical products.
 During the quarter we shipped 700 SYSTEM 1E units, as compared to 1,300 units last year. We ended the quarter with approximately 800 units in backlog, representing a majority of the SYSTEM 1E units we had planned for in Fiscal 2013. We have communicated to our customers our May 1 deadline for all orders to be received in order to guarantee installation by the August 2 deadline.
 Healthcare consumable revenue declined 9%, but excluding the combined S20 and S40 volume decline of 44%, the rest of our Consumable business grew low single digits. So in total our Healthcare revenue declined less than 1% which was a direct result of both the reduction in the SYSTEM 1E capital shipments and the S40/S20 consumable decline, both of which were not quite fully offset by the growth in the rest of our business.
 Healthcare backlog at the end of the quarter was $102.5 million. We believe that the decline in backlog is more a matter of timing than reflective of current market trends. Healthcare operating margin in the quarter declined 110 basis points, due primarily to reductions in the combined S20/S40 volumes. Life Sciences revenue declined 8%, which was in line with our expectations due, to a tough capital equipment prior year comparison, which resulted in a 24% decline in capital equipment revenue.
 Service revenue in the quarter declined 2%. However we did have another strong quarter of revenue growth in Consumables, which grew 10%. Backlog in Life Sciences was $50.1 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of 23% as compared with last year, driven mainly by orders from our pharmaceutical manufacturing customers. We continue to see pharmaceutical manufacturing - manufacturers spending on replacement capital equipment more so than large projects, and believe that trend will continue in fiscal year 2013.
 Life Science’s operating margin increased 270 basis points to 18.3%, primarily as a result of higher gross margin attainment, as well as lower operating expenses. Revenue for Isomedix increased 11% in the quarter. Revenue benefited from an increased demand from our core medical device customers. Isomedix operating margin was 27.4%, driven by the increase in volume, which was made possible by the capacity expansion investments we have made over the past couple of years.
 Moving onto the balance sheet; in terms of the balance sheet, we ended the fiscal year with $150.8 million of cash and $210 million in long-term debt. You may have seen our 8-K announcement in mid-April discussing our new credit facility terms. We have replaced an expiring credit facility with a new $300 million line of credit, which expires in 2017. Our balance sheet remains strong and we believe that we are in a very good position to continue to invest in our businesses and return value to our shareholders.
 During fiscal 2012 we invested $35 million in the acquisition of new businesses and returned $95 million to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We continue to make progress on improving our working capital positions. Our inventory levels at $157.7 million are lower both sequentially and year-over-year, while our DSO at 74 days has improved verse the prior year. Our accounts receivable balance of $280.3 million does not include $13 million of pending credits related to our SYSTEM 1 rebate program.
 If AR is adjusted for these pending credits, our DSO would improve by another 4 days to 70 days. Capital spending was $12.4 million during the quarter, while depreciation and amortization was $16.6 million. Our free cash flow for fiscal year 2012 was $82.7 million compared with $41.6 million last year. The improvement in free cash flow is due to lower working capital requirements and lower capital spending. Included in free cash flow is the use of $41.2 million of cash for the SYSTEM 1 rebate program and class action settlement.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us this morning. Now that Mike has given you some perspective on the quarter I will discuss the full year and our outlook going forward. Heading into fiscal 2012, we anticipated growth in both revenue and earnings. While we are pleased with a 6% increase in our top line, we experienced some unanticipated events that challenged our bottom line. These challenges included an extension of the SYSTEM 1 transition as well as the unanticipated expenses related to SYSTEM 1E uptime reliability, both of which hindered our profit in fiscal 2012.
 Even though we did not grow profit we are pleased with what we have accomplished in the face of these significant challenges. We have been working through the SYSTEM 1 transition for 4 years now, from the warning letter in May 2008 to the anticipated last shipment of S20 in the United States in August of this year. This transition has taken longer and been more costly than we originally anticipated and we have hit a few bumps in the road, but we have worked very hard to provide the most appropriate products and services for our customers and see them through a successful transition. At every turn, we have worked to do what is right for our customers and acceptable to the FDA even when it resulted in significant additional expense for STERIS. We believe this long-run view will pay off over time.
 At the same time we were working through the transition, the rest of our business, i.e. the business except for U.S. SYSTEM 1 and 1E, has performed very well. We are especially pleased that we delivered solid top line growth in every STERIS business in 2012 with the exception of our Healthcare Consumable business, which was impacted by the decline in sterilant for SYSTEM 1. We grew 7% in healthcare capital equipment revenue in 2012. That 7% is excluding 1 and 1E sales. It would be 15% if the 1E capital were included.
 It was a good year for several major product families including V-PRO, integrated operating rooms and LED lights. Combined, our new and next generation products reaffirmed our 100-year-old reputation as a technology leader. This allows greater margins as customers find value in our more effective, more efficient, higher capacity and greener offerings. Outside of S20, our healthcare consumable franchise grew low single digits, with continued strength in Prolystica Chemistries, BHP consumables, which are related to our growing installed base of V-PRO Sterilizers, and our sterility assurance products.
 Our Life Science business had a very good year in 2012, growing revenue 5%. We started the year anticipating that our Capital Equipment business would remain flat. Not only did our Capital Equipment business grow 6%, but the profitability of the Life Science business in total improved over 300 basis points. This improvement was achieved even with a significant mix shift toward traditionally lower margin capital equipment. The Life Science consumables franchise delivered another year of high single-digit growth.
 Isomedix grew a solid 8% as we have continued to invest in this business by adding capacity to meet customer demand. During fiscal 2012 we began expanding a gamma facility in the Northeast, which we will complete in the next few months. And we will be adding additional capacity in the Southwest in fiscal 2013 as well. Two months ago we bought a contract laboratory service provider for medical device and pharma manufacturers called Biotest, which provides validation services to our customers. It is a natural extension of our Isomedix business. We spent about $12 million on the deal, or about 1.5x revenue, and anticipate that Biotest will add several hundred basis points to our top line Isomedix growth, and will be neutral to modestly accretive to STERIS’s bottom line in fiscal 2013.
 We made the decision to make several strategic investments in our business in fiscal 2012, which has impacted our profitability to date. But they’re the right decisions for the business over the long term. In addition, we have continued - we have seen continued impact on our margins from the SYSTEM 1 transition. As a result of these factors, fiscal 2012 adjusted operating profit margins declined to 15% of revenue. And adjusted earnings per share were $2.16, a slight decline from the prior year, but in line with our expectations.
 Over the last year, we have improved our working capital performance and ended the year with a strong balance sheet and improved cash flow. We have returned value to our shareholders by increasing our dividend during fiscal 2012 to $0.17 per quarter, representing the sixth year in a row of double-digit increases in our dividend payment. We currently plan to continue this approach of double-digit percentage dividend growth.
 We also purchased close to 2 million shares of stock at a cost of $56 million. Fiscal 2012 was a challenging year for us, and our people did a nice job meeting customer needs. We anticipate that fiscal 2013 will be a pivot year for the company as we complete the SYSTEM 1 transition in the U.S. and establish a new baseline of revenue and profitability off of which we will grow in the future. However, compared to the $57 million in SYSTEM 1E capital sales, which is about 5 years of normal unit sales, as well as sales of S20 sterilant during fiscal 2012, we have one last year of difficult comparisons due to the SYSTEM 1 transition.
 Our forecast for fiscal 2013 is to grow the business, excluding U.S. SYSTEM 1 and 1E fast enough to offset the SYSTEM 1/1E decline in revenue in order to remain flat from a top line perspective. I will now map out in more detail how we plan to meet those revenue growth expectations.
 Let’s first start with SYSTEM 1 and 1E. We shipped 3,800 SYSTEM 1E units in the U.S. during fiscal 2012, totaling $57 million in revenue. And we anticipate that we will ship approximately 1,000 units during fiscal 2013, or around $15 million in revenue. In addition, given how strong the S20 franchise was at the beginning of fiscal 2012, we anticipate that the revenue of the combined S20 and S40 sterilant franchise will decline $10 million during fiscal 2013. In sum that is a $52 million reduction in revenue. But the good news is that we believe we can fill that gap with the strength of the rest of the business.
 To start we are anticipating mid, single-digit revenue growth in the rest of our healthcare business with balanced performance in the infection prevention and surgical businesses. We hear from our hospital customers that procedures in capital spending will be flat to slightly up for the year. We expect our growth will stem from low single-digit market growth and additional success with our newer products.
 Our Life Science segment is anticipated to grow revenue in the mid-single digits as pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to spend on replacement capital equipment. We anticipate another good year for the consumables in Life Science as well. We believe we will have another attractive year, revenue year, for Isomedix in 2013, with low, double-digit growth driven in part by the recent Biotest acquisition, and by the increased capacity that I mentioned earlier.
 From a profitability perspective, we anticipate a number of things moving in the right direction during fiscal 2013. We believe we can improve gross margins from fiscal 2012 levels, driven by a mix shift in our product sales and success with new products. SG&A should grow low single digits in fiscal 2013, as the benefits of our consolidation efforts and reduced spending on SYSTEM 1E will be offset by anticipated payments of our management incentive compensation and modest impacts of inflation.
 Our previously announced consolidation efforts are now virtually complete. So we do not believe we will incur additional meaningful expenses for those consolidations going forward. In addition, the $12 million that we spent during fiscal '12 to improve up-time performance of SYSTEM 1E will be reduced to approximately $7 million on more than double the average installed base, and should largely occur in the first half of the year.
 We believe the culmination of all these factors will result in earnings per diluted share of $2.00 to $2.20 for the year. We do anticipate that earnings will be weighted toward the second half of the year, with approximately 40% of earnings in the first half and the balance in the second half. Our outlook does not include any impact from the medical device excise tax, which we believe could negatively impact earnings per share by as much as $0.02 to $0.04 in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
 We believe there’s enough uncertainty regarding this tax, the timing of implementation, the ultimate tax rate, what products and services are included and excluded, not to mention the judicial and political future of the tax as part of healthcare reform. But since it only impacts one quarter of our fiscal year, we are treating it as a one-time unusual event at this time and removing it from our guidance. Naturally, we will address these issues as warranted along with other results of healthcare reform and corporate tax rates as we learn more what the courts, Congress and the administration decide.
 As I mentioned earlier, we believe that fiscal 2013 will be the platform off which we will grow in the future. Beyond 2013, our long-term plans include goals we think we can reasonably achieve: mid- to high single digit revenue growth through a combination of market growth, successful new product introductions and acquisitions. We expect leverage on that top line growth to deliver double digit earnings per share growth. Given our reported results the last couple of years, our long-term objectives may seem aggressive, so let me explain one of the reasons we believe they are reasonable.
 If we look back at what we’ve accomplished over the last 4 years, the results are significantly greater than the long-term profit goals I mentioned a moment ago. If we set aside the negative impact of U.S. SYSTEM 1 and 1E, we have managed through a global recession, healthcare reform and a significant reduction of one of our most profitable profits and with all these issues included we have still grown EPS over 15% per year compounded the past 4 years. Obviously we would have done even better were it not for the SYSTEM 1/1E reductions. We believe we can produce double digit performance the next several years and do not expect to face that combination of obstacles again.
 Moving forward, we will continue to manage our costs, grow our business with internal product development, invest in greater capacity and augment these value-creating methods with the acquisitions of tangential products and services. We have a strong balance sheet and cash flow and will use both to grow the business.
 One of the ways we plan to create value going forward is to in-source much of the production that we have traditionally outsourced. We have come far enough with our lean approach that we can utilize the capacity we have created to produce many of our purchased components. We expect to invest over $20 million of capital the next 18 months to do this and create better quality, better delivery and lower costs. We have also increased our efforts toward acquisition of tangential products and market opportunities, both by internal development and acquisition. We continue to believe the future for STERIS is bright and look forward to the attainment of our goals. With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to begin Q&A. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Walt for your comments. We’re now ready to begin the Q&A session. So Kaylin, would you please give the instructions and we’ll get started? 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you and our first question comes from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. 
Jason Rodgers: It looks like Infection Prevention had a good quarter, up double digits. I was wondering if you could talk about what the drivers there have been. 
Walter M. Rosebrough: You know, Jason, Infection Prevention and Surgical both had a pretty good year. And capital bounces a little bit so it just so happens they had a bit stronger quarter. That quarter versus the Surgical side. But in general, there’s a general growth rate but also our newer products. V-PRO specifically had a very nice quarter and we expect it to grow significantly over the course of the year. And we have a number of new products on the plate that we’ve introduced and we are introducing that we think will improve that. 
Jason Rodgers: And do you have the amount of the 1E backlog on a dollar basis? 
Julie Winter: It’s about $12 million, Jason. 
Jason Rodgers: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Robert Goldman from CL King. 
Robert Goldman: Good morning. 
Michael Tokich: Excuse me, Bob. I should add that, that backlog would have been at the end of the year, not current. Sorry, Bob. 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Morning, Bob. 
Robert Goldman: Good morning. A few details, I think they were mentioned. I know they were mentioned in your commentary but I didn’t write them down quick enough. So first, the SYSTEM 1E units that were shipped in the fourth quarter, how many were those? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: There were 700 SYSTEM 1Es shipped in the fourth quarter. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. And then when you speak about the total company sales growth would have been 4%, excluding the SYSTEM 1, 1E sales, are you excluding 1, 1E sales in both the fourth quarter of the '11 and '12? And then arriving at the 4%? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Yes, that is correct, Bob. We’re excluding the U.S. SYSTEM 1 and 1E portion of revenue in both fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2011, and that would have been 4% growth. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. And the foreign exchange impact in the quarter, Mike? 
Michael Tokich: The FX exchange impact in the quarter was actually a negative 0.4%. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. And I’ll be refining my models a bit. But I get the sense, and tell me if I’m wrong on this, that the SYSTEM 1/1E consumable sales in the fourth quarter had a bit of a bump up from what we’ve seen in the prior quarters. Am I just modeling it wrong, or is that correct? 
Julie Winter: No, that’s fair, Bob. Given that we’ve continued to install over the last several quarters, we would anticipate to see that ramping. 
Robert Goldman: Well, but at the same time, I suspect folks are using less of the SYSTEM 1. But given all that, you’re saying there was a bump up in the consumable sales in the fourth quarter, relative to the third? 
Michael Tokich: Bob, Julie misunderstood the question. She was speaking specifically of S40. S40 and S20 have been on a ramping decline, and I don’t happen to know off the top of my head if that rate changed significantly. But the endpoints that we have been describing, kind of all along, that being in that 30% to 40% percent range of sterilant is still in play. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. And then I believe you mentioned that doing better in your 2013 projection are SYSTEM 1/1E consumable sales of $10 million. Is that correct? 
Michael Tokich: That is actually what is going to be lost year-over-year in fiscal 2013, as compared to 2012. So remember, in 2012, especially at the beginning of the year, we still had a large percentage of retention on the 1E, specifically the S20 business. That obviously is going away, as the first half of this year, as August 2nd deadline comes due. So we believe that’s going to be about a $10 million negative impact on revenue. 
Robert Goldman: And then finally, I know you mentioned, but again I didn’t write it down quick enough, the consumable sales on the 1/1E franchise for 2012? 
Michael Tokich: The total consumables? Well, no, the only thing I talked about was the quarter declined 44%. Is that what you’re asking, Bob? 
Robert Goldman: No, I thought Walt had mentioned what the total consumable sales for the year were on that franchise in 2012. 
Walter M. Rosebrough: I mentioned that they’re down to $10 million, 2013 over 2012, Bob. 
Robert Goldman: I got you. Okay, but will you give the SYSTEM 1/1E consumable sales in 2012 or would you just as soon not? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: No. The only indication we’ve given, Bob, every quarter we’ve you the decline of the combined S20/S40 consumable volume. We will not give a specific number, though. Although we tried to give you an indication in '13 about how big that decline is going to be so you can understand the hurdle that we’re going to overcome. 
Robert Goldman: Right. Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Ben Mackovak from Rivanna. 
Ben Mackovak: Actually my question was answered. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Mitra Ramgopal from Sidoti. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Yes, hi. Good morning. Just a few questions; Walt, I believe you had mentioned in terms of the growth you’re looking forward to beyond fiscal 2013 related to new product introductions and continued success with V-Pro, et cetera, I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what you’re seeing again in terms of hospital cap spending and what leads you to believe we are going to see a pick up there? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Yes. We have seen - I’ll bifurcate two components. The first is what I’ll call ongoing or routine capital spending. That has continued, I will call it routinely, you know roughly flat, maybe slightly up. And from what we are hearing from hospital CEOs and the people who determine capital spending, that’s kind of the path they’re on right now. In terms of large projects, as you know we look out at large projects several years in advance. We’re working on projects several years in advance because they are building projects and we’re seeing a similar trend. It’s actually the number of projects are down slightly but the size of the projects have grown such that in total it’s grown slightly. So in terms of market we’re kind of looking at that low single digit to mid-single digit growth of market and then we add on top of it some of the new product entries we expect and that’s what gets us to that number. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. Any concerns in terms of what’s going on in Europe as it affects your international business? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Well, Europe has been as you know under pressure for a good long time. The good news for us, and I’ll take first about balance sheet issues. The good news is we don’t have a lot of receivables or business in Greece, Portugal, et cetera, what I’ll call the most severely affected countries. We do have a good business in Spain, Italy, France, so those countries are under pressure and we’re watching them closely. We clearly have seen reductions in the spending levels of what I’ll call the traditional Western European countries, but conversely we’ve seen pickups in some of the again traditional Eastern European countries in the Middle East. So when you pull it all together, we are seeing pressure, but not as bad as the newspaper headlines might suggest. 
Michael Tokich: Hey, Mitra, if I could just add, for the full year, our total company growth in Europe was 5%, so it - that rings true to what Walt just said. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Thanks. That’s very helpful. And quickly on CapEx - I know it’s ticking up a little this year. And one of the things you mentioned was reducing costs. Is any of that assumed cost reduction in the guidance for fiscal 2013? Or is that a more longer term issue? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Yes, Mitra, almost all of the - it takes a while to put these things in place. We’ve announced one of them and have started doing work on a fabrication center here in Ohio, that will really not be coming up to speed until late this calendar year, so we’ll see a little bit from that one. The other things we’re working on will be put in place the back half of this year and the first half of next year, so we won’t see much of any of those savings in fiscal '13, but we do anticipate it then, but we don’t see any significant numbers in '13. We would expect to see that result in '14 and beyond. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question or comment comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. 
Christopher Cooley: Hi, guys. I apologize, I’m in an airport. I just want to make sure I heard one of the stats you quoted there in your prepared comments. You mentioned that the year-over-year decline in SYSTEM 1E consumables, or I should say sterilant, in fiscal '13, is expected to be approximately $10 million. I guess if I’ve heard that correctly, should I then assume there’s a further step down in fiscal '14? Just trying to do the math here on the install base and the implied reduction in sterilant usage. Or are you able to continue maybe on some of that lost share base with a lower price point chemistry there? I’m just trying to get my hands around that number and then I have one follow-up. Thanks. 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Chris, there will be some, I would call it very modest continued decline next year, but it will not be significant and we think it will be overshadowed or more than overshadowed by improvements that we’re making that is costing us money in terms of the up-time reliability. So the answer is, yes, there’ll be some modest reduction, but not something we don’t think we can overcome. 
Christopher Cooley: Okay. And then secondly, just looking at your free cash flow number - targets for the year, and I understand the company’s gone through some difficult period the last three years, but I guess the nit that I have is just looking at your free cash flow, it’s actually looking down again or flattish versus what you just reported. So for fiscal 2012 I guess when you start to think about it structurally, has the business’s profitability come down? I’m thinking that as you work through some of these initiatives that you’ve had obviously throughout fiscal 2012, the weight on your profitability and your growth. I realize this is a transition year. This isn’t the bounce back year; that’s next year, fiscal 2014. But why does that free cash flow come back up in fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012? Or is this going to be normal from a loan rate perspective? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Yes, Chris, let me - I’m going to talk about capital. I’ll let Mike talk about the working capital. But this year we are really stepping up the capital spending in the business twofold. Actually it’s about $30 million. We’re adding capacity in Isomedix again, so that’s a significant step up. And part of that just happens to be we do cobalt loading on a sequence of events. And it just happened our - what we expected our fourth quarter cobalt loading last year to - that fell into our first quarter this year. So we’re seeing a little bit more - a few million dollars more in the cobalt side. And we’re investing in those expansion facilities that I’ve already mentioned.
 In the rest of the business we’re clearly taking a step up, looking at insourcing, which we think will pay for itself handsomely over the next few years. And so we’re putting about $20 million of additional capital above and beyond what we would kind of historically spend in that arena. And that’s a specific, strategic approach. So it does not affect our earnings significantly this year because the depreciation doesn’t hit until we put it in place. But it clearly affects our cash flow.
 And Mike, if you want to talk about the working capital side? 
Michael Tokich: Yes. In contrast to that we’re actually able to offset basically a little bit more than those investments that we’re making from a capital expenditure standpoint through some improvements in working capital, specifically in our accounts receivables and accounts payable balances is what we’re looking at from a planning standpoint. So even though it looks a little flattish, there are positives and negatives going on. Again, we are spending a little bit more, but we’re actually able to offset that spending even a little bit more than that and still say flattish. Now, if you exclude the rebate program and class action lawsuit, we actually are showing a bit of an uptick, Chris, in there which is probably more relevant. And gain, we’re assuming that the remainder of the $69 million of liability is all processed and the use of cash will occur all in 2013, fiscal year 2013 as those two programs come to an end. 
Christopher Cooley: Let me, so just if I could replay that back just to make sure I’m on point here. So it sounds like on a normalized basis, the free cash flow level is around, approximately $100 million on a normalized kind of go-forward basis, is what you’re talking about, if I adjust for that incremental spend on the capital side and some of the in-sourcing there. 
Michael Tokich: Yes. $100 million, $110 million, you’re in that ballpark. 
Christopher Cooley: $100 million or higher. 
Michael Tokich: Yes. 
Christopher Cooley: Yes. Okay. Okay. Thanks so much. 
Michael Tokich: Thanks, Chris. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And I show no other questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back for any closing remarks. And we just had one queue up. I apologize. One moment. And we do have a question or comment coming from Jeff Karansky from DRZ Inc. 
Jeff Karansky: Just one quick question. It looked like you guys didn’t do any buy-back in the quarter. What’s kind of your thinking there? You’ve got $118 million authorized, stock's pretty cheap. What’s kind of the company’s view there? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Well in general, I’ll step back in the way we look at it. First of all, we are in, our use of cash is first to invest in the business, and we clearly knew we were going to pick up our capital spending this year, as we just spoke about. Our next component is dividends, and we’ve discussed kind of what our thinking is on dividends.
 The next two components, in rank order of business development that adds to our business, we mentioned an acquisition, actually we’ve made a couple of them this past 12 months to 15 months, and we’ve been picking that up. We do have a number of things on our radar. One never knows if those are or are not going to close, but that’s certainly something we’re taking into account. And the fourth is stock buyback, and that’s clearly something that we continue to watch. We did buy back a little over $50 million last year, and it would not be surprising if we bought some back this year. 
Jeff Karansky: What’s the criteria again on acquisitions? I mean is that something that you like to see immediately accretive? Or how do you view that? 
Walter M. Rosebrough: Well, we take a longer term view than that. In fact my criteria is more, I would call it strategic based than financially based in terms of, I like things that are right next door to me. They’re a product that I can put into my current markets. Or if I go to expand into a different market, a classic example, the Biotest that we just talked about, that unit has shares - they do something different than our Isomedix folks, but they share the same customer and the work precedes the work that Isomedix does.
 So we believe our channel can improve their revenue generation. That’s a classic example. The converse is when we bought Sercon in Brazil we have a series of products that are very much like their series of products. Theirs are more specific to the Latin America market and they have a channel that expands on the channel we had in Brazil. So one way or the other I’m looking for something that people use different terms for it - tangential, tuck-in. Words like that and that’s my very first criteria.
 Secondly, we would probably take some dilution in a very short period. We don’t expect to take dilution for long periods as a general statement. And certainly our #1 criteria is really the internal rate of return that we generate on the products or on the acquisition. So we manage it for cash. So that would be the criteria. 
Jeff Karansky: Okay. Thanks, guys. 
Walter M. Rosebrough: You bet. 
Operator: Thank you. And I show no other questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back for any closing remarks. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Kaylin. This concludes our conference call. Thanks, everybody, for joining us and we’ll talk to you next quarter. 
Operator: Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-02-07 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the STERIS Financial 2012 Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At the request of STERIS, today's call will be recorded for instant replay. I would now like to introduce today's host, Julie Winter, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to STERIS’ Fiscal 2012 Third Quarter Conference Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us.

 With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike. Mike? 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our third quarter financial results. Similar to prior calls I will make some comments on the quarter before turning the call over to Walt for his remarks.
 Before I start with a review of the income statement, please note that my references to the prior-year's operating results exclude the pretax charge related to the SYSTEM 1 class action settlement and the tax benefit from the SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program liability. Please refer to today's earnings release for a complete reconciliation to GAAP numbers. 
 Total company revenue grew 8% during the third quarter driven by 7.5% increase in volume, a 1.2% increase from our acquisition of Sercon offset by a slight decline in pricing of 0.5%. We had no material impact from currency fluctuations in the quarter. Gross margin in the quarter declined 280 basis points to 38.9%. Factors influencing gross margin in the quarter included a 30% reduction in SYSTEM 1 and SYSTEM 1E consumable volumes, a shift in mix during the quarter towards capital equipment, a decline in pricing and an inventory write-off of $1.1 million relating to our European consolidation efforts.
 EBIT including restructuring expense for the quarter was $53.7 million or 15.1% of sales. During the quarter, we incurred restructuring expenses of $1.2 million due to a loss on the pending sale of our Switzerland manufacturing facility, which is part of our European consolidation efforts. EBIT excluding restructuring expense was $54.9 million or 15.5% of sales. The decline to EBIT margin is due to lower gross margin detainment, an increase in R&D spending and the impact of continued investments for the long term. 
 As we explained last quarter, we have incurred expenses related to product reliability issues and our consolidation programs. We previously anticipated that these expenses would total $6 million in the second half of the fiscal year. However, these expenses totaled $5 million in the third quarter. Over half of these expenses related to product reliability issues with the remaining related to our consolidation programs. We now anticipate that we will incur approximately $7 million in expenses in the fourth quarter for a projected total of approximately $24 million for the full fiscal year. We have had some offsets to these expenses, most notably the reversal of our annual incentive compensation plan.
 Given where our performance is through the first 9 months of this fiscal year, we are now assuming that no bonuses will be paid as part of our annual incentive compensation plan. Hence, we have reduced our compensation expense by $4 million in the quarter for a projected total of approximately $12 million in the full fiscal year. 
 The effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.1% compared with 35.6% last year. Net income including restructuring expenses was $33.6 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared with $34.1 million or $0.57 per diluted share last year. Moving on to our segment results, Healthcare revenue in the quarter grew 9%. Capital equipment revenue increased 22% driven by shipments of SYSTEM 1E units as well as single-digit growth in both our infection prevention and surgical business units. 
 Offsetting that strength, consumable revenue decreased 7% primarily due to continued reductions in S20 volumes and a decline in service revenue of 1%. Healthcare backlog in the quarter was $135.8 million of which $14.74 million is for SYSTEM 1E units. Healthcare operating margin in the quarter declined 380 basis points caused by the decline in gross margin, cost associated with consolidation programs and investments made to improve product reliability.
 Life Sciences revenue increased 9% with capital equipment revenue up 25% and consumable revenue up 4% offset by a 1% decline in service revenue. Backlog in Life Sciences was $45 million at the end of the third quarter. Life Sciences operating margin increased 410 basis points to 18.4%. The margin expansion was primarily the result of volume increases.
 Revenue for Isomedix increased 4% in the quarter and as anticipated our revenue growth rate has slowed down somewhat compared with the last few quarters as we have anniversaried our capacity expansions. Isomedix operating margin increased to 29.6% of revenue as a result of continued improvements and efficiencies in the business. 
 In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $143.8 million of cash and $210 million in long-term debt. Sequentially, we improved our working capital position, as we were able to reduce inventory by $15.8 million, which more than offset a 3-day increase in DSOs. Our accounts receivable balance of $251.4 million excludes approximately $16 million of pending credits related to our SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program. If you adjust AR for the pending credits, our DSOs would improve by approximately 4 days and would be comparable with the prior-year DSO. As you may recall in the first quarter fiscal 2011 we established a $110 million liability related to our SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program. 
 Through the end of the third quarter, customers have utilized or committed to utilize approximately $54.4 million on orders placed since the initiation of the SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program. If all eligible customers holding the remaining outstanding SYSTEM 1 units elected the maximum incentive, the total estimated rebate program cost would be increased by approximately $3 million. Conversely, if all eligible customers holding the remaining outstanding SYSTEM 1 units elected the cash incentive option, the total estimated rebate program costs would decrease by approximately $25 million.
 Utilization of the rebate program to date has been consistent with our original estimates and as a result, we do not believe that a change to the liability is required at this time. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of fiscal 2012 was $58.6 million compared with $28.3 million in the prior year. Capital spending was $19.8 million in the quarter while depreciation and amortization was $16.1 million.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt? 
Walter Rosebrough: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us today. 
 Our third quarter performance is similar to our second quarter. We had solid revenue growth and strong free cash flow. Our profitability, however, was impacted by certain investments we continued to make for the long-term benefit of our customers and the company. 
 From a top line perspective, all 3 of our business segments reported solid growth marking our fourth consecutive quarter of growth across each segment. Of note, our Healthcare segment reported 22% growth in capital equipment or 6% excluding the SYSTEM 1E units shipped during the quarter. In a macro environment that continues to be challenging, we are encouraged by those results.
 As I discussed last quarter, we had anticipated that the delay in V-PRO shipments would benefit us in the second half of the year. And we did see a nice revenue improvement in that product line during the quarter. In addition, our Reliance EPS and our line of washer/disinfectors experienced solid growth. In our surgical business unit, we saw good growth in our lighting and integration lines. 
 Our Healthcare consumables business outside of SYSTEM 1 and SYSTEM 1E related items continues to grow in line with surgical procedure volumes in the low single-digits. Life Sciences built on its earlier solid performance through the third quarter. The highlight was a 25% growth in capital equipment revenue as we continue to see more purchases of replacement equipment by our pharma customers. 
 Our Isomedix unit had another good quarter in both revenue and in profitability. As Mike has already addressed we continue to invest for the long term, which is impacting our profitability. The general categories are similar to last quarter. Transition related costs for our Europe and Erie consolidation efforts as well as SYSTEM 1E uptime reliability costs. We are working on several initiatives to reduce the uptime issues experienced by some customers with SYSTEM 1E, most notably around facility water.
 In addition to working with our customers to improve their incoming water and increasing the frequency of preventing maintenance calls, we have filed a special 510K with the FDA to implement software modifications that will allow the SYSTEM 1E to handle a wider range of facility water characteristics without incurring certain nuisance aborts. We have not yet received clearance from the agency for the special 510K in order to implement to this field correction but anticipate a determination on this submission soon.
 To round out our discussion on SYSTEM 1E, we shipped about 1,300 units in the quarter and ended the quarter with 1,000 orders in backlog. Quotes and orders continue to come in on a daily basis and we had about 2,000 open quotes at quarter-end. Also, we continue to work with the FDA on the de novo submission for our spore based monitoring strip and anticipate a clearance decision for our customers. 
 As we indicated in an 8-K filing in December, the FDA extended our support of current SYSTEM 1 customers in the US up to August 2, 2012 provided those customers complete a certificate of transition. As we mentioned at the time, we anticipate that up to 1,000 units may be delayed from Q4 to fiscal 2013 as a result of this change. So we now anticipate we will ship about 4,000 SYSTEM 1E units during the current year.
 Moving on to our outlook for fiscal 2012, as you have seen we are adjusting both our top and bottom line expectations for the year for 2 primary reasons. Our revised revenue expectation of 6% growth assumes that all 3 business segments will deliver revenue growth of mid-single digits. The most significant changes we anticipate are a reduction in Healthcare growth from our prior expectations and an increase in Life Science growth given the strong performance to date. Our expectations for Isomedix are unchanged from the beginning of the year. 
 In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that our long term investments in the business will continue at a higher rate than our previous estimate. As a result, our EBIT margin for the full year is anticipated to be approximately 15% and our full year earnings per diluted share will now be in the range of $2.13 to $2.20 excluding restructuring expenses.
 Our free cash flow is expected to be $90 million as reported or $110 million excluding the payments related to the SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program and class action litigation. We continue to anticipate that capital expenditures will end the year around $70 million. I look forward to sharing our expectations for fiscal 2013 with you in May, when we announce our fourth quarter results.
 With that, I will turn the call back over to begin the Q&A portion of our call. 
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A session. So, Wendy, would you please give the instructions and we'll get started. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Goldman with CL King. 
Robert Goldman: It's Bob Goldman. A couple of questions. First, it's my understanding that on February 2 the customers of SYSTEM 1 had a deadline to send to you at STERIS details of their transition plan from SYSTEM 1 to something else. SYSTEM 1E or a competitive device. Could you provide us some granularity on what those customers have said? How many of them are going to transition to the 1E? 
Walter Rosebrough: Bob, you're generally correct on the transition program. That is that customers, if they are continuing to use S20 or SYSTEM 1, and are looking for our support that they do -- it is required that they send in their certificate of transition. That certificate of transition though does not give information on what they are transitioning to or from. So other than the fact that people are sending in transition documents saying, we are transitioning later than February 2, and some indication of when they expect to be transitioning, we have no other granularity on that issue. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. So just so I'm clear on it. The FDA did not require nor have the customers suggested what they're transitioning to. 
Walter Rosebrough: That’s correct. On the form that we receive back, which is the certificate of transition, it does not state what they are transitioning to and it's -- there is no request of what they are transitioning to. And I'm confident, Bob, that would be, I think, potentially considered confidential information if -- for other vendors if the FDA required that and sent it to us. So I'm confident that's why they would not do that. 
Julie Winter: And just one point of clarification, Bob, we will accept certificates of transition ongoing. We didn't have to have them in by February 2. So we can get them today, next week, a month from now and effectively turn people back on for support of SYSTEM 1. Just for clarification. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. So they were not required to get you that letter by February 2? 
Walter Rosebrough: The hospitals -- nothing is required of the hospital really if you boil it down. We cannot support them if they don't have the transition document to us. So we cannot continue to sell them S20. We cannot support the device if they don't have that in. So effectively, Bob, if they want to continue they have to get that certificate of transition to us. If they want to place an order on February 3, they have to have it to us on February 2. 
Robert Goldman: And if they haven't submitted to you yet, you cannot support them after February 2, is that correct? 
Walter Rosebrough: It is correct that we cannot support them until they give us their certificate. So if they give us their certificate on the 4th we can ship on the 5th for example. So we wouldn't expect, frankly, we wouldn't expect a lot of these to come in 3 months from now, right? We would expect them to come in over days and a couple of weeks, not months. 
Robert Goldman: Okay. And then one other question on the investments you're making, Walt, this year, the $24 million. You mentioned $5 million in the third quarter, $7 million in the fourth projected, could you give us a little bit more detail on what you're doing and as a result what, if any, are the associated expense savings when you look out towards fiscal 2013 and beyond? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, I would split it, Bob, into 2 categories. One category in general is the transition costs in both Europe and Erie and we're seeing the tail of those transition costs if you will. And we have talked about the going forward -- first of all there's a reduction in the cost obviously. And then there are going-forward savings. And, Mike, you may want to mention those. 
Michael Tokich: Yes. Those are -- we'll a couple million dollar savings as we go into next fiscal year associated with both of transitions, both Erie consolidation project and then also the move from Erie, Pennsylvania to Mentor, Ohio, we'll see some cost savings there. But we're talking about $3 million to $5 million in total. And then the other piece, Walt, if you want to address the product reliability. 
Walter Rosebrough: The other piece is what I talked about in SYSTEM 1E is we are doing a lot of work with our customers to: a, help them ascertain what their water quality is; b, ascertain how they -- what they can do to fix it; c, working with our devices to work with them through this process until they get that done. And then lastly the field corrections that we have talked about with the SYSTEM 1E to make the device more robust against a wider range of water quality. And so that expense will be disappearing as we complete that. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. 
Jason Rodgers: Could you talk about raw material cost for the quarter, the impact, and then what you're looking for in your outlook? 
Michael Tokich: Yes, Jason. Raw material cost for our third quarter were basically flat. For the year-to-date we are about a negative -- just over $4 million for the year-to-date through December. And we're expecting a slight -- sorry the increase in costs for the fourth quarter but nothing too material is the outlook that we're assuming. 
Jason Rodgers: Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the regions in the quarter overseas and how Europe performed as well as Asia Pacific and Latin America? 
Walter Rosebrough: Sure. We had very strong performance in Asia Pacific. In Latin America it was below our expectation but not significantly below our expectations. Largely in the new Sercon unit where we're a bit behind what our expectations were. In Europe they had modest growth, lower single-digit growth and given the pressure in that environment we were feeling pretty good about them maintaining that side on the Healthcare. Life Science actually had strong growth in the period. So on average we were in the mid to upper single-digit growth in Europe. So good strong performance in that region of the world. 
Jason Rodgers: Okay. And then Healthcare was up 22% for capital equipment. Do you have that figure -- what that figure would be excluding Sercon? 
Julie Winter: There's a couple of steps here, Jason. So excluding SYSTEM 1E our growth would have been about 6% in Healthcare capital equipment. Excluding Sercon, we'd be 2% to 3%. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. 
Mitra Ramgopal: A couple of questions. First, I think the investment spending for fiscal 2012 you indicated was about $24 million. I wasn't sure if you can give us a preliminary stance on an apples-to-apples basis what that would look like fiscal 2013. 
Walter Rosebrough: Well, we haven't done the forecast for 2013 but the expenses that relate to the Europe and Erie transition will largely go away. There may be modest expenses next year but it would be modest. The SYSTEM 1E type of expenses, we again are not -- we haven't forecast that number yet. But we are beginning to see a reduction or an improvement in the uptime particularly in the last month or so. Our uptime or frequency of calls, if you will, dropped by about 30%. So we are anticipating that going down over the course of next year. 
Michael Tokich: I would caution you, Mitra, not to just back out and assume that $24 million goes completely away because about half of that is being absorbed through bonus because we are not -- we are assuming zero bonus payouts this year. So that's about $12 million. So the next is about $12 million in total that is impacting. As Walt said, we probably will experience some of the SYSTEM 1E warranty costs next year also. I just want to caution you there. 
Mitra Ramgopal: No. That’s very helpful. And again as we look at the units that you expect to transition over on the SYSTEM 1E side, is there a way of helping us in terms of how much of that might be sort of high utilization versus low by your customers? Or too early? 
Walter Rosebrough: At this point we still I think are suggesting that it will be, as best we can tell, roughly our average utilization. And we've said kind of historically that we expect the range of 30% to 40% of if you will from the beginning of time couple of years ago, 30% to 40% of the [indiscernible] volume is kind of the range we're looking at right now. 
Mitra Ramgopal: Okay. And again, Walt, finally if you look at the last 2 years, clearly it's been a difficult environment. And we've seen the earnings go -- it's sort of flattened here and I know you're not providing any guidance yet for fiscal 2013. But as we look out ahead, do you get the sense that you're pretty much now at the bottom or the inflection point in terms of where things stand with the transition, the investments you're making, and other initiatives you have in place? 
Walter Rosebrough: We still have the SYSTEM 1 transition is not over and of course it fell all through the course of the year. So even when you hit the bottom of that, you still have some SYSTEM 1 if you will hang over going into next year. When you look out long-term though and of course some of these costs that we have will go away as we've talked about before. If you look out in the long-term we're still feeling like high single-digit, low double-digit growth rates are what we should be expecting. Order of magnitude, that's our view of the longer term. 
Mitra Ramgopal: And finally, are you noticing any pickup really in the hospital spending environment for you? 
Walter Rosebrough: Most of what we see -- I guess I'd say 2 things. We look at the same third party things that you look at and hearing from hospital folks, we're kind of seeing their conversation is around flat to up a little, flat to up a few points next year. We don't have a whole lot of visibility out beyond that. And so I think at this point that's kind the way we are seeing their overall spending pattern. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jose Haresco with JMP Securities. 
Jose Haresco: Couple of questions. You had spoken last quarter on this, that there would be like $6 million of expenditure. [indiscernible] you eat through much of that, and in fiscal Q3, there's $7 million more coming in Q4. That’s a big chunk so is that a pulling forward of expenses? Or was there something in the quarter that kind of caught you guys by surprise that you realized we need to spend another $7 million? 
Walter Rosebrough: I would characterize most of that as expenses that were greater than we expected, largely in the area of the SYSTEM 1E. So we did as you recall we said last time that we had -- the spending we already had we were anticipating working to reduce that in this second half. We are working to reduce it. We are seeing some positive results but it did not get reduced as quickly as we anticipated. 
Jose Haresco: Okay. And just remind us again, what are the outstanding issues with the SYSTEM 1E? Uptime, transition and installation? I understand there's still a backlog of installation. So what are the 3 or 4 things that still have to be -- you still have to get under control to get it to where you need to be? 
Walter Rosebrough: Well the biggest issue for the SYSTEM 1E is what I'll call aborts and possibly nuisance aborts. That is we have put in -- we recognize that there are water issues in the SYSTEM 1E that we want to monitor for. For example, the temperature of the incoming water because the temperature during the process is an important part of the process. So if we get too much cold water coming into the system the system will recognize it will take it too long to get to temperature and as a result will abort. So what we have done -- so that is an example of the kind of thing. The other is it relates to the incoming water quality. It's how much UV light intensity that we receive from the UV lamp, which is pre-treating the water going into the device for rinsing purposes. And if we see that intensity falling or that the water doesn’t allow the transparency if you will of the UV light, we will alarm -- and in both these cases the alarm shut off and we have to have a technician come out. So those are the 2 a high level -- and by far and away the 2 most significant aborts that we are getting. So when they get that abort the technician has to come out, look for the cause of the abort, solve the cause of the abort and then put them back up and running. Those are the most significant frequency issues. And again, the 2 solutions to that are either fronting the SYSTEM 1E with something that improves that incoming water a la a water heater. A la, a, if you have very hard water, a water softener. Those are the typical type solutions. As well as we have worked on our aborts, and this is what I'm talking about the field correction we have coming up, we have worked on our aborts such that for example instead of timing out the water temperature abort in 3 or 4 minutes, it's 8 or 9 minutes or maybe even 10 minutes, which the customers are seeming to prefer over getting an abort. So the water just runs if you will. Just like if you're going to take a shower, you have to let the water run until it gets to temperature, as an example. So those are the kind of things that are in that special 510K that we mentioned and those are all software upgrades. 
Jose Haresco: Okay. And if I remember the number right, you said it was capital equipment without SYSTEM 1E was 6% growth year-over-year? 
Michael Tokich: That was for Healthcare capital equipment, yes. 
Jose Haresco: For Healthcare capital. Okay. And how did disposables and consumables do outside of SYSTEM 1E? 
Julie Winter: They would have been up from the low single digits. 
Walter Rosebrough: As I mentioned they're low single digits, kind of in line with surgical growth. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Tyler Kenyon with Northcoast Research. 
Tyler Kenyon: Tyler Kenyon here in for Dave Keiser. I wanted to ask a few questions just around the change in some of your assumptions, specifically with Healthcare. I know before you had mentioned that you were anticipating growth in the low double-digit. So I guess I wanted to maybe hear from you exactly what maybe had changed in the market to maybe change your assumption there. 
Walter Rosebrough: I don't know that we've seen an overall change in the market per say. We were just looking -- we're now down to the last quarter, we're looking at the order inputs. Orders and timing of orders. And what we have in backlog and what we will ship for the balance of the year. And we believe that is what our shipments will be. In terms of kind of the market in general, I would say when we talk to our salespeople the, what I'll call the relatively routine orders for capital are going through at the pace that they would have expected and we would have expected. We are seeing a slowdown in some of the large capital orders, large project orders. Again, at this point we see that as temporal. That is not -- they're just getting the jobs done. Their projects are a little bit behind. That kind of thing. Not a slowdown -- we're not seeing capital projects disappearing. We're not seeing capital projects cancelling. It's just the timing of those capital projects. So that's how we characterize the difference. 
Tyler Kenyon: Okay. And then just follow-up on Life Sciences. I know that you had expected relatively flat growth and you had adjusted that upward to the mid single-digits. So I guess I'm wondering are you just seeing more replacements or are you happening to see maybe an uptick in maybe some of the larger projects ongoing maybe in pharma. 
Walter Rosebrough: There are a few projects, but the preponderance of the change is replacement. And as you know, they really slowed down a few years back and stayed slow for a pretty good lick. So it's not surprising to see some return of that business. 
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Cooley with Stephens Inc. 
Christopher Cooley: I just wanted to touch base on 2 fronts if you could, and following up on the question on Life Sciences. You continue to drive great growth there on the capital side. I was a little surprised at the lag in the rate of year-over-year growth shown in consumables. Could you maybe give us a little bit of color? Are these capital-specific projects and they don't necessarily have the same tail as it pertains to custom chemistries or to the service? Or is that a component that we should see pickup and there's just a lag affect there? Could you maybe give us some color on that? And I have a follow-up. 
Michael Tokich: Yes, Chris. I would say that the biggest differential that we saw in the third quarter regards to the Life Sciences consumables, yes, they did not grow as quickly as we had seen in the past. But I would attribute that more to timing or as you mentioned a lag. It so happened just the end of the quarter happened to fall with holidays and everything else. So we just did not see the shipments at that point in time. But I would attribute more of that to timing. I would not attribute it to anything differential in the marketplace. 
Christopher Cooley: Okay. That makes sense. And then on Isomedix, the growth rate there in the quarter, that was the lowest that you guys have had since fiscal 2010. And I realize that you're going to get back to a more normalized environment but you've taken some share, you've expanded capacity. A little surprised to see it drop that much during the quarter as well. Could you maybe give us clarity. Were there any one-time events? Did you see like de-stocking at the manufacturers levels? Anything that would maybe [indiscernible] dropped that by maybe a couple hundred bps in the quarter that brought that back down to that rate? 
Walter Rosebrough: Chris, it's pretty much the same answer as Life Sciences. As you know, Isomedix had been holding up stronger than we anticipated early in the year. The growth was a little less in the fourth quarter but it was again largely around year-end and it appears to us to have been timing and not a temporal change. 
Christopher Cooley: Okay. And if I could squeeze one last one in here. I know it's been a longer call. But just on the BI applications still there in front of the FDA, do you have to get resolution first on your amended 510K now for these software upgrades as they pertain to the pre-treatment of the water before you can see that move forward? I'm just trying to get an understanding of what has to take place there before we can maybe see a BI approved for the 1E. 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes, Chris. On that, in candor I'm not 100% sure the answer to that question. But timing wise, the special 510K we expect typically that’s in kind of a 30 to 45-day timeframe and we're in that timeframe. So we don't see the BI being held up for the other 510K. 
Christopher Cooley: Are they're still questions outstanding on the biological indicator? 
Walter Rosebrough: We're not aware of any questions outstanding. As far as we know it's internal to the agency processing. 
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Goldman with CL King. 
Robert Goldman: Just some questions on cash flow and I appreciate you having given out some data on that already. Based on the 9 months of free cash flow and recognizing what your free cash flow was in 2011 for the year, it looks like you might be going at a free cash flow pace for 2012 of about $130 million for the year. And I just wanted to get a sanity check. And also sort of your directional sense on free cash flow growth from whatever the level is in 2012 as you look in the years beyond. 
Michael Tokich: I would say, Bob, we have given guidance of $110 million excluding the impact of the SYSTEM 1 and class action settlements. So we have gone and improved our free cash flow. The big change to that in this quarter, which got us to $58 million for the year-to-date period is we did do a better job of taking down inventory much faster than we had anticipated on our last call. We've got about $26 million of SYSTEM 1E inventory remaining on the balance sheet. Obviously our DSOs did increase but as I tried to explain in my comments that is really exaggerated because of the credits yet to be issued associated with the SYSTEM 1 Rebate Program. Again going out looking at 2013 until we give 2013 we're not going to comment at that point in time. But we feel comfortable in the $110 million range for this fiscal year. 
Walter Rosebrough: But Bob, I would say as a general statement, we still have inventory to work down. We still have SYSTEM 1E inventory to work down. The transition that we did in Europe where we moved factories, we built inventory in anticipation of that and we still have some of that to work down. So I still see orders of magnitude $15 million, $20 million of inventory that we will continue to work down. So independent of the net income level starts this conversation but I would continue to see inventories work down and I think we have further improvement in our turns. We continue to improve our factories. We're improving response time. The second piece of that is to improve the turns in those factories. So on the inventory side clearly we see ongoing improvement as a percentage of the business. When you look at the receivables picture, our receivables are pretty good actually in the mid-60s with the 1E rebate issue. And the low 60s without it, which puts us well in the range of our compatriots in this business. And so we have pretty good receivables. We continue to work down those receivables. And so we will be working that down. We clearly are having some pressure in Europe on receivables, but that's an area where we clearly will keep focus on that and try to keep our receivables turns looking positive. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. 
Jason Rodgers: Looking at the water issues for the 1E, about what percent of your current 1E customers are experiencing those abort issues? And have you lost any customers because of it? 
Walter Rosebrough: Yes. It varies by their individual water issue. So they have -- if they have cold water problems, they will get that abort. If they have others -- we do have customers that are not seeing any significant level of aborts. So it does vary around the map. But it is significant and we're again, that's why we are spending so much money to work it down. At this point, and our returns in this product line are exceedingly low, which are typical of our returns in general. Certainly under 1% and the last document that I saw in terms of units lost or those kind of things is 10 or 15 or 20 kind of numbers, not 300 or 500 or 1,000 kind of numbers. So small numbers. This is a very attractive product for customers. But obviously nuisance aborts don't make them happy. That's why we're putting so much field service time and effort and money into it: a, to get them back up quickly; and then, b, to work to resolve the issues. 
Jason Rodgers: And once these software upgrades are approved, will this change the cycle time of the 1E at all? 
Walter Rosebrough: The only place that I'm aware -- generally, no, is the start answer. The only place I'm aware of where the answer might be yes is again just like if you're going to take a shower if they are waiting longer for the water to hit temperature for the first cycle typically of the day, then that may. But that's the question of the water's not warm enough when it's coming in, do you want to abort? Or do you want to let it run for 2 more minutes and warm up. But other than that run time, I'm not aware of any -- it might be 2 seconds or something. I'm not aware of any significant change of cycle time other than again, the front end if you have cold water. 
Operator: Our next question is from Brad Evans with Heartland. 
Bradford Evans: Just, Walt, you had indicated I think that you're longer term targets are for mid to high single-digit revenue growth, is that correct? 
Walter Rosebrough: Profitability growth. 
Bradford Evans: Profitability growth. Can you just amplify that a little bit in terms of how do you see -- what does that mean for longer term top line growth do you think over the next say 3 to 5 years? 
Walter Rosebrough: Again, I'm sure we’ll talk more about that in May, but as a general statement what we said is the market and our revenue growth in that market for our internal only is in the low to mid single-digits that we should be returning -- improving profitability within that and so our profitability be in the high single-digits to low double-digits. And clearly to capture some of that growth we would expect some of it to be through business development. But orders of magnitude, that's the numbers we're thinking of. 
Bradford Evans: Do you think achieving margins that we saw in 2010 fiscal year, are those achievable again in the future do you believe? 
Walter Rosebrough: We've talked about ranges of margins in this business and in that 15% to 20% range are reasonable margin levels. And clearly we're having some things that are depressing our margins right now and we would expect to grow those back. 
Bradford Evans: So the last question I have is just you look at a lot of angst around the SYSTEM 1E transition. It's created a couple of year transitional period for investors, patient investors and it's obviously reflected in the valuation of the company, which I think most people would argue the company's valued well below -- at least in the marketplaces, is valued well below intrinsic value. And you've done a very good job of returning capital to shareholders. Special dividends and the share buyback, I just wonder whether -- has the board had any vigorous discussion on whether maybe a Dutch tender offer would be an appropriate use of capital considering extremely low interest rates and your underlevered capital structure. 
Walter Rosebrough: We look at the various ways to use our capital and clearly in rank order we have thought through those components. And the first is to invest in the business and to continue to grow the business that we currently have. Secondly, we don't intend to be cutting dividends and in general we would expect to see dividends rise over time. Thirdly, is for business development opportunities that are tangential to our business so we can place money in businesses where we can gain synergies, either revenue or cost synergies by having them tangential to the businesses we have. And last is obviously share buybacks. And the method or approach to share buybacks we just don't discuss that. 
Bradford Evans: Well, it sure seems like on a risk adjusted basis it's hard to find acquisitions that are as attractive as your own stock at this valuation level. That's just my opinion. 
Walter Rosebrough: Appreciate it. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I show no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Julie for any closing remarks.

Mike Tokich: Thank you, Julie and good morning everyone. This morning I'll spend my time reviewing our fourth quarter results then Walt will discuss the fiscal 2010 full-year results and view our outlook for fiscal year 2011. Before I get into details of the quarter, there are few moving parts in our numbers, so for clarity let me remind you that included in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, our restructuring expenses. The actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 included our decision to transfer the remaining positions in the Erie Pennsylvania to Mentor Ohio as well as to consolidate our European healthcare manufacturing operations into two center locations within Europe. Both of these actions will take 18 months to 24 months to complete, so did our assumption that additional restructuring expenses of approximately $4 million will be incurred over the next two years relating to this actions. The actions taken in the fourth quarter are anticipated to generate annualized savings of approximately $4 million. We anticipate these savings will be realized over the next couple of years with approximately $1 million benefiting fiscal 2011 and $3 million benefiting future years. My discussion of the fourth quarter results would exclude the restructuring expenses in both fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009. Let me now begin with a recap of the income statement for the fourth quarter. Total revenue decreased 3.6% during the quarter. Volume declined 6.4% while pricing contributed 1.1%. And a weaker U.S. dollar contributed 1.7% to the growth in revenue. Gross margin in the quarter was 42.8%, an increase of 190 basis points. The increase was driven by pricing, productivity improvements and lower raw material costs. The $1 million favorable impact from raw material cost primarily related to stainless steel. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined 70 basis points to 25.8%. Included in operating expenses for the quarter are product modification expenses of $3.2 million which is primarily related to changes we made to a portion of our 30 85 surgical tables in the field. EBIT margin for the quarter improved 270 basis points to 17%. The expansion in EBIT margin is due to improvements in gross margin and our continued efforts to improve efficiencies. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.8%, compared with 38% last year. Included in the quarterly rate is an unfavorable discrete item adjustment of approximately $1 million resulting from the provisions of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Net income increased 15% while earnings per diluted share of $0.55 represented an increase of 12% during the year. We move on to our segment results. Healthcare revenue in the quarter decreased 5%, as consumable revenue grew 3% in the quarter driven by growth in new products specially Prolystica Ultra Concentrate chemistries offset by lower SYSTEM 1 consumable sales and a negative impact from the timing of H1N1 purchases. Service revenue grew 4% due largely to the timing of installation projects that were completed during the quarter. Healthcare capital equipment revenue declined 13% in the quarter with comparable declines in both of our infection prevention and surgical businesses. With backlog increasing 7% to $127.8 million in the quarter, we believe that the capital equipment declined is largely a matter of timing. As we've discussed in the past, our fourth quarter has typically been our strongest quarter for shipments of capital equipment. And as you know, we've been working to level our production. Healthcare operating margin improved 200 basis points to 18% of revenue driven by improved gross margins offset somewhat by the product modification expenses booked in the quarter. Life Sciences revenue in the quarter was flat, as compared to the prior year. as a result of the 11% increase in consumable revenue, a 6% increase in service revenue offset by 10% decline in capital equipment revenue. Capital equipment in Life Sciences continues to be impacted by consolidations limiting the order levels of our pharma customers. Backlog to Life Sciences in the quarter declined 8% to $41.8 million. Life Sciences operating margin improved 670 basis points to 14% of revenue driven by product mix and efficiency initiatives. Revenue for Isomedix increased 5% in the quarter. We once again were able to offset the loss revenue from our facility sales last year with a modest increase in demand from our core medical device Customers. Isomedix operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased 23.6%. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $215 million in cash. Our total cash position currently exceeds our long-term debt by $5 million. In addition, during the quarter we repaid the outstanding $100 million from our credit facility. Capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization were each $14.2 million in the fourth quarter. We finished the year with a record $184 million in free cash flow. This represents a 26% increase as compared to the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow, as a result of our increased earnings, and our continued improvements in working capital management. This completes my review of the fourth quarter results. I'll now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Walt?
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Mike, and thanks and good morning to all of you on our call. Now that Mike has put the quarter in perspective. Let me spend some time on our full-year. We entered the fiscal 2010 with more uncertainties than we had seen in the last several years. This was a result of the economic environment in United States including our customer's lack of access to capital. The new administration's healthcare reform proposals and our SYSTEM 1 regulatory matters. As we close our 2010 fiscal year and start 2011, we have greater clarity on many of these matters and are very pleased with our performance in that challenging 2010 fiscal year. We completed fiscal 2010 with total revenue down only 3% and a strong capital backlog. Focusing on a few highlights for the year; one was clearly the performance of our consumables franchise across the business. Healthcare consumables grew 7% for the year led by growth in new products such as Prolystica Class 6 [ph] indicators as well as an increase due to the H1N1 virus endemic. On the Life Science side, consumables grew 13% again impacted by H1N1, but also a result of volume increases and some price recaptures. While it was a more challenging year for capital equipment, we did have pocket to strength particularly for new product lines like Vision washers, V-Pro Sterilizers and LED lights. Shifting to profitability, we generated even more efficiencies than we anticipated which led to a substantial expansion in EBIT margins. We are particularly pleased with the progress our people made outside of North America. Last year, we were profitable in all major geographic regions and all regions contributed the profit growth. As a result, our earnings per diluted share excluding restructuring charges for a record $2.21 or 15% better than our very solid 2009. These results were achieved even though we saw a decline of about $20 million in revenue for the year and SYSTEM 1 capital equipment consumables and service. As we recently announced, we reached an agreement with the FDA on the transition plan for our SYSTEM 1 customers, and received clearance on SYSTEM 1E, which will be an important part of that transition plan. We believe SYSTEM 1E is the most compatible single product on the market to replace SYSTEM 1. It is clear for the process of immersible, usable, semi-critical and critical heat sensitive medical devices, which are the most common applications of SYSTEM 1. But it has only been a short time since the new product has been cleared for marketing. The initial feedback we're getting from our customers is encouraging. Looking forward to fiscal 2011, we anticipate that our core markets will generally improve to more normalized growth levels. In particular, within our healthcare segment, we anticipate mid-single digit revenue growth with the majority generated from market improvement and 1% to 2% from the net impact of SYSTEM 1 and SYSTEM 1E and their associated consumables. That in combination of flat performance in our Life Science segment and low single digit growth in Isomedix is anticipated to result in total company revenue growth of approximately 5% for the year. We expect our EBIT margins to be in the 15% to 16% range with the somewhat higher anticipated tax rates in fiscal 2010. We anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.30 for the full-year. Now this is a bit of a wide range, but the uncertainty surrounding the SYSTEM 1 transition, potential increases in commodity cost, the impact on the economies in Europe and resulting exchange rate uncertainty and some lack of clarity around health reform applications causes to have some caution in our outlook. We anticipate that earnings will be fairly evenly split in fiscal 2011 with approximately 45% to 50% in the first half and the balance in the second half. Our expectations for fiscal 2011 are clearly being impacted by the transition away from SYSTEM 1 to alternative products. This outlook for 2011 excludes the one time reduction of revenue and operating income with the rebate program as well as restructuring expenses. It does however; include other expenses such as startup cost and the net impact of the transition to 1E. We expect S20 Sterilant revenues in the United States to fall steadily during the year as we approach the August 2011 deadline to transition from SYSTEM 1. By the end of fiscal year 2011, we anticipate that 50% or more storage SYSTEM 1 use maybe transitioned to alternatives. Coinciding with that decline in higher margin consumable revenues, we are anticipating a pickup in demand for alternative products in particular SYSTEM 1E. In order to accommodate our customers, we plan to sell SYSTEM 1E for just slightly more than SYSTEM 1 during the transition period. We believe SYSTEM 1E is the most capital efficient option on the market for customers transitioning from SYSTEM 1. Our outlook is that we will be able to manufacture significantly more units than we have in the past putting us around 4 to 6000 1E units in fiscal 2011. As we mentioned in our call two weeks ago, we're not planning on passing along the additional expense to build SYSEM 1E capital and thus the capital units will make significantly lower margins in SYSTEM 1 capital equipment and meaningfully lower margin than the S20 consumable revenue that we anticipate losing throughout the year. Further as we ramp-up S40 volume, it will cost more to make than S20, but we are pricing at the same as S20 to our customers. As volumes build in future years, we expect the new Sterilant to cost about the same as S20. The lower profitability from these capital and consumable sales will impact gross margins, as our SG&A is anticipated to be flat to be down on $1 basis during the year. Outside of SYSTEM 1, our growth opportunity is clear. We believe we have the precious product line in our history and we will continue to innovate. We're receiving favorable customer reaction from our new line of operating room tables and iQ 2100 OR integration unit and see good results from our V-PRO, new line of washers and LED lights. In addition, consumables including Prolystica continue to grow nicely. We will also improve our efficiencies as we strive to become a lean organization, and we will remain disciplined and not allowing the inefficiencies we have eliminated to feedback into our company's volume improves. These past few months have been extraordinary for everyone at STERIS. With the customer focus and commitment of our people has been truly first class. I appreciate all their hard work and dedication and the results they have achieved. With that, I'll turn thing back over to Julie to begin the Q&A portion of our call.
Julie Winter: Thank you, Mike and Walt, for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A session. So, Sarah would you please give the instructions and will get started.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Daniel Owczarski with Avondale Partners. Your line is open, sir.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Yes. Thanks and good morning.
Walt Rosebrough: Good morning, Dave.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Walt, you had a comment that customers to early feedback is favorable on the SYSTEM 1E. I was wondering if you could give us any more color is to what their concerns are? What the questions are? What the reactions? Where do they want to dig deeper on this issue of SYSTEM 1E vis-à-vis a swapout SYSTEM 1?
Walt Rosebrough: Well, Dan, I think the main questions were around what devices they will be using or be processing in SYSTEM 1E versus SYSTEM 1 and as you know the product is clear for heat sensitive devices and so they are looking to determine which of those devices that they maybe currently using SYSTEM 1 fit that category. I would say that's probably the number one generalized question. But then naturally they are wanting to understand what the cost of the new unit is to them going forward and of course as you know, the rebate program is a function of the life of their existing units. So they're looking for that information and of course we're providing. I would say those are two most typical questions from our customers.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Okay. And is it still too early to tell rebate versus the STERIS credits, how that's going to break out versus what you expect the customers to say?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, I would say it's way too early to tell. We do have good indications. We have a few orders, a handful of orders and we have the SYTEM 1E and we have a number of proposals in quotes out there where customers request for quote I'll call it. But it's way too early to tell how that's going to break out.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Okay, and then you talked about selling it just for a slight premium, the 1E as a slight premium to SYSTEM 1. Could you give us any kind of order of magnitude of how much more expensive – how much more it costs SYSTEM 1E to manufacture than SYSTEM 1?
Walt Rosebrough: Dan, we don't give product line cost and/or profitability. But it is significant.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Okay, and is that because of the extra UV light with the water?
Walt Rosebrough: Absolutely. The bulk of the cost differentiation is the filtering in UV light that added to the product.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Okay. Alright, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Bob Goldman with CL King. Your line is open.
Bob Goldman – CL King: Good morning, everybody.
Mike Tokich: Good morning Bob
Walt Rosebrough: Good morning Bob.
Bob Goldman – CL King: Good morning. A couple of questions. First on gross margin, the guidance for 2011, I'm trying to understand what some of these SYSTEM 1E transition factors have on your guidance for gross margin in 2011. Is there a way to call that out to give us some sense of what the gross margin in 2011 would have been relative to 2010, were it not for these transition issues?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, I would say it would have been flat to slightly positive and in general I would have said, if you go even further down, as I've talked about many times with you all that we generally are looking for kind of high single digit, low double digit growth in EBIT through a combination of growth and revenue and margins and I believe we would have been on track for that kind of growth, were it not from the SYSTEM 1E margin net decline.
Bob Goldman – CL King: And when you look at it a little bit more, say to the following year, is it reasonable to expect that in that year, 2012, your gross margins will have essentially made up that negative impact of transition?
Walt Rosebrough: We're not giving 2012 guidance but I would say that the startup cost portion of that will largely be passed in 2011 but there is still a mix issue we're a long way from doing a forecast on that mix at this point in time. There still could be mix issues between the products. But in terms of the startup costs, I would expect that most of that would be behind us.
Bob Goldman – CL King: And I have a couple of other things. On the free cash flow, your guidance in 2011 is considerably less than in 2010 and perhaps you can walk us through why?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, and the bulk of that, and I'll let Mike chime in behind me but the bulk of that is the increased capital expenditures. First of all, we had an extraordinarily positive year this year. Literally everything that makes up free cash flow went the right direction for us. So our receivables were down in days, our inventory was down – up in turns, down in dollars and of course we had good net income and relatively capital expenditures under our depreciation and amortization. Next year we have several discreet items in capital spending and we've announced most if not all of those. Certainly two of them we've made announcements on. One is the center here in Mentor where we're spending about $11 million and the other is our European expansion and consolidation. And so those are two of the four kinds of discreet increases to capital spending and those are all profit improving expansions. The balance is fairly routine expenditure and we do have, for each one of our large expenditures is in our Isomedix business where we're buying cobalt and that fluctuates a bit based on the cobalt replacement cycle. But that's the principal reason for the difference in free cash flow.
Mike Tokich: Okay, Bob, if I could just add one thing there, we are definitely planning on continuing to improve our working capital management but the year-over-year improvement will just not be as dramatic as Walt has already alluded to. So we will have a little bit of a decrease from a free cash flow standpoint. But all our working capital measurements are planning to improve year-over-year.
Bob Goldman – CL King: And then just one more question. You mentioned in the press release, and this is relative to your discussion on healthcare sale, that you've got efforts underway to reduce the seasonality of capital shipments and frankly, I didn't understand that. I can understand how you can change the seasonality of production. But just explain a little bit more if you can what you mean by reduce the seasonality of capital shipments and how that impacted sales in the quarter?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. We have worked very hard over the last 24 months, in particular this year to have our shipments mirror our customers demand as opposed to sometimes mirroring our quarters or our annual fiscal cycles. And so this isn't a matter of us moving out. Customer based seasonality exist. It's a matter of us smoothing out seasonality that we create due to our quarters and our years and so in essence, we are working very hard to run our factories, for lack of a better term, I'll call it flat fashion or relatively smoothly and have the differences in our product rates reflect customer demand issues and not our own issues.
Bob Goldman – CL King: Okay. So this doesn't impact sales at all in the quarter?
Walt Rosebrough: It's just timing of sales. If you over the long term, the sales will be the same. It just affects the timing of capital sales.
Bob Goldman – CL King: Okay. I'll follow-up off-line. I've got a few more questions, but thank you.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Bob.

Jason Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: Good morning.
Mike Tokich: Good morning Jason
Jason Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: Looking at hospital capital spending, I wonder if you could provide some commentary there as far as what you see now versus what you saw last quarter and if you're seeing a pickup now?
Walt Rosebrough: I don't think we've seen a significant change in the last couple months. Clearly compared to this time last year when things were looking kind of ugly, it clearly looks better and different. But I would say, generally speaking, what we have seen is forming to slight improvement of what appears to be our capital pattern anyway. And I think that's generally aligned with what other people seem to be seeing.
Jason Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: Okay, and have you seen changes in payments in Europe given the issues going on there now?
Walt Rosebrough: We haven't seen substantial changes. We have seen of course there some countries that are traditionally slow payers and they continue to be slow payers. But we haven't seen any overwhelming change, no.
Jason Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: And finally the impact of FX, do you have that for the year for sales and operating income?
Mike Tokich: Yes Jason. For FX impacts for the years, we were just slightly favorable from a revenue standpoint less than $1 million and on the EBIT standpoint we were unfavorable by approximately $2 million.
Jason Rodgers – Great Lakes Review: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Joshua Zable with Natixis. Your line is open.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here.
Walt Rosebrough: Good morning Josh.
Mike Tokich: Good morning.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Great job on the profitability front again. I just had a couple of questions here. First, you guys mentioned some restructuring, European restructuring, the $4 million annualized savings. You guys have been doing a lot obviously, on the cost save front. Is it safe to assume that that's sort of a new program, that's not something you've announced before?
Walt Rosebrough: This brand new program Josh, we just made decisions on in the fourth quarter.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Okay, great. And then just – you made a comment about H1N1 difficult comps. Obviously, it makes sense. I'm just kind of wondering, was there any benefit from H1N1 this quarter? Or was it nothing?
Walt Rosebrough: Actually, from our standpoint, it was actually a negative benefit because we saw in our third quarter, some timing of purchases where they purchased a larger volume in the third quarter as compared to what they would normally purchase in the fourth quarter.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Okay, great. And then just looking out at the guidance here, specifically, the top line guidance, I'm just trying to go through and think about equipment versus consumables. You obviously get a boost, if you will, from those SYSTEM 1E sales depending on obviously how the warranties work out or the rebates et cetera. So, I'm just trying to think about to really think about that healthcare number going forward because that's obviously going to be the key driver of revenue. So, any color around consumables and equipment would be helpful. Thanks.
Walt Rosebrough: We're anticipating if you include the transition from SYSTEM 1 to 1E, that we will see positive increases in capital consumables and service. So all of components will show growth year-over-year.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Okay. And that's pretty much it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Josh.
Operator: Our next question is from Brad Evans with Heartland. Your line is open.
Brad Evans – Heartland Funds: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question.
Walt Rosebrough: Hey, Brad. How are you?
Brad Evans – Heartland Funds: I'm doing well, thanks. Again, thanks for the question – for the opportunity. I'm just curious with respect to the – 2011 obviously will have the SYSTEM 1 transition costs, which takes you off of the trend that you had been exhibiting from a margin expansion perspective and I'm just curious, Walt, if you maybe could help us understand or Mike, where you see the operating margin goals for the business over the next two or three years as we start to anniversary the transitional costs of the SYSTEM 1E transition?
Walt Rosebrough: I think as a general statement, we'd say we're continuing to look for efficiencies both in the gross margin line and in the operating expense lines. But one of the things that we also look at is how we trade that off in price to our customers. So I don't see a radical change in that theory. That is, we will continue to be looking to get more and more efficient. But a piece of that efficiency, we will clearly pass off to our customers in less aggressive pricing if you will. And a piece of that we would intend to take into the profitability of the corporation.
Brad Evans – Heartland Funds: Okay. Just looking back to the third quarter of this year, you had an 18% operating margin. Is that a type of number you think – as we get into 2012 or 2013; is that a type of number that we could think about achieving on a more sustainable basis?
Walt Rosebrough: I would not say that those numbers are out of the question. The numbers in the mid teens are respectable numbers if we see volume growth.
Brad Evans – Heartland Funds: Understood. Okay. That's helpful. Just another follow-up then in terms of – Walt, you've spoken a lot about level loading the factories to provide more efficiency and that's been an ongoing effort for you. Does that relegate backlog for the healthcare division to be less meaningful? Does that give your customers greater confidence of your ability to ship with shorter lead times that might have the effect of diminishing the importance of backlog going forward as a measurement?
Walt Rosebrough: I don't think our customers care about our backlog. They just care whom we can deliver. And so it is true. One of the things that we do when we do that is by definition, we work to be even more reliability in our delivery metrics. So that does. But backlog is literally just a function of how much orders we have and how much we shift. I do think you'll see, in some respects you may see even more variation in the backlog because it will be customer demand issue. The customer, if they're building a new operating room and they're building it six months from now and they want to get their equipment all figured out and purchased, it doesn't make a difference to them what our backlog is. They want the stuff six months from now, not today. And they may place the order today. And so backlog really is largely a function of when the customers want the equipment versus when they want to place the order and so I don't think we'll see a meaningful change in backlog as a result of this work.
Brad Evans – Heartland Funds: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just one last question. Your balance sheet is in outstanding shape and obviously, the outlook for strong free cash flow, which has been a hallmark of the company for some time. I'm just curious how you view the prioritization of deployment of free cash flow going forward?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure and we've talked about that. We see no difference. We do like cash and we think it's a great measure of the business. But I'm talking about creation cash flow creation. In terms of use of cash, our first use is always going to be to invest it internally to improve the business and we will do that judiciously but as we see fit to improve the business. The second use is clearly to look for ways to grow the business, either by internal means or external means and the third and fourth are different ways to return that cash to shareholders, either dividends or through stock buybacks and we try to balance those based on the situations at hand we will continue to do it that way.
Brad Evans – Heartland Funds: Okay. Thanks and good luck. Congratulations.
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jose Haresco with Brean Murray. Your line is open.
Jose Haresco – Brean Murray: Good morning and thanks for taking the question.
Walt Rosebrough: Good morning.
Jose Haresco – Brean Murray: Good morning. A couple of questions. Really on a two year time span, you mentioned that we should think about gross margins being down for 2011. You also mentioned that operating expenses – and correct me if I'm wrong here – operating expenses on a dollar value should be flat to down. So, as we look beyond 2011, as you work through this transition with SYSTEM 1E, should we expect or can we expect gross margins to kind of snap back up to perhaps where they were in the early part of fiscal 2010 or even for all of 2010? And should operating expenses still have a very de minimis level of growth, say over 2012 – 2013 or do you expect the spend to ramp back up at that period?
Walt Rosebrough: Again, we really are not giving 2012 and beyond guidance. But I'll just say the general statement. First of all on the OpEx side, we're clearly looking for ways to leverage OpEx. You can't keep OpEx going down forever and you can't keep it flat forever. But relative to the revenue generation, generally speaking we're going to see OpEx grow more slowly than revenue. There are some exceptions. Some of our OpEx components are almost a function. They're for example. They are variable, for example the commission rates for sales people, the charges for group purchase fees. So, though we do have some variable components but generally speaking they are not variable. We have generally speaking were to limit the OpEx outside of areas like R&D sales service folks in the field and in our quality and regulatory area, those areas we have invested money the past couple of years when we expected to invest in those areas, but generally speaking other areas we expect them to remain constant or fall if we can. I think that's a general comment about OpEx. In terms of the margins we will see these two years, 2011 and 2012. It will be mix issues between the SYSTEM 1E and other products in the company. So, there will be mix issues going on and then in 2011 we have the start-up cost issues, I would expect the start-up cost issues to be largely behind us in 2012. It is way too early for us to forecast 2012 mix issues in those products. And then I would say by 2013 that should all pretty much be dissipated.
Jose Haresco – Brean Murray: Okay. Just following up on that, then. The decline in the gross margins is primarily tied to product trend, the service margins shouldn't change all that much or am I wrong about that?
Walt Rosebrough: The service margins in general don't change but again we are being on the system or rather SYSTEM 1E, we are just as we did in SYSTEM 1 sales we are clearly giving our customers a good deal as we entered this business.
Jose Haresco – Brean Murray: Okay. And I'm sorry if I missed this. What was the actual dollar figure for cost of product and cost of service in the quarter?
Julie Winter: I don't have that broken out in front of me. Jose, can I circle back on that?
Jose Haresco – Brean Murray: Yes. That's fine. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Shawn Fitz with Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open.
Shawn Fitz – Stephens Inc.: Yes, thanks. Walt, in your prepared comments, you gave us a number that you all internally expect about a 50% of your historical base will go to other technologies. And I'm talking about SYSTEM 1. Could you maybe, as we think about I guess your current install base of about 20,000 units and your capacity to manufacture, could you kind of walk us through the logic in a broad sense that gets you to that number.
Walt Rosebrough: First of all that 50% would include SYSTEM 1E not the exclusive of SYSTEM 1E. So, we are – when I tell alternative technologies, I mean alternative technologies including SYSTEM 1E. So, that's a good point of clarification because I am not sure I made that clear. The second, in general as we said we are thinking about 4000 to 6000 units in the fiscal year production. You mentioned there is about 20,000 in total and of course we do have ramp up period during this fiscal year. So, that is kind of the logic to it. Now it's worth mentioning, we have said before that roughly 15% to 20% Sterilant sales are down roughly15% to 20% as of the end of March. And so, the 15% to 20% of Sterilant sales that has already converted to something, some of it may convert back but again that is 15% to 20% in some senses already gone and then the balance. It is obvious that like most things this fits a bit Pareto like small number of the units or a large amount of the Sterilants. So, it is not and we will see customers as they move some of their or as they move their non-heat sensitive devices to other technologies generally speaking. As they move those away they won't need as many SYSTEM 1s to do the work because they will only be doing work on the heat sensitive devices. So, it's a combination of those three factors that come together and that's just our best view of how far along they will be in the transition to both SYSTEM 1E and/or other technologies we sell and/or other technologies that others sell.
Shawn Fitz – Stephens Inc.: Okay, thanks, Walt. And then, just as we think about turnaround time on SYSTEM 1E versus SYSTEM 1 are they similar turnaround times for the two technologies?
Walt Rosebrough: The turnaround time mean processing?
Shawn Fitz – Stephens Inc.: Yes, processing and then how quickly the unit can be basically turned around and ready for another round of processing.
Walt Rosebrough: Yes in fact it's about 20% faster; it's one of nice features of the device. Couple of other very nice features is there is less affluent or more environmentally friendly I will call it affluent but turnaround time is clearly one of the nice features of this device. It is already a very fast device, the SYSTEM 1, this one is even faster.
Shawn Fitz – Stephens Inc.: And so just as we – you said there's the law of maldistribution at play here in terms of certain units being a disproportionate amount of you cycle times. Should we be thinking that, that will grow in terms of will you see, basically, a higher utilization of the SYSTEM 1E units in the market or in your install base of customers?
Walt Rosebrough: That's not clear yet and it depends on how they convert, there is a complete opposite side of the story that I just told you. There are some customers that are very, very dependent on this device that use relatively small amount of Sterilant but they are just small customers and so this device is very important to them. So, I think we will still see a distribution not unlike the distribution we have seen before and the question on what the – I will it what the Sterilant per unit will eventually look like, is a combination of the two factors. One hospitals have and other users have; they might have a number of these units and they are 15 to 18 years old. They may say, let's we are going to move this set of goods out to out to steam sterilization, and as a result we will need a little less and we can file these units and use them more practically. So, they may purchase less units and then do more clicks per unit if you will. And then that will be somewhat offset by the fact that some of the devices that are currently been done in SYSTEM 1 will be done in steam. And how that all works out, we are not 100% sure, we don't see it being radically different. It's not like we don't expect that 50% drop or increase in Sterilant per unit out there.
Shawn Fitz – Stephens Inc.: Okay, Walt. Last question. Could you help us understand why the cost of producing S40 is meaningfully higher than S20?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure, it's purely a volume issue. It is a startup in volume issue purely. In terms of – so that's why I said as you go out in time as the volumes of S40 cross into the relative order of magnitude volume levels S20. We don't expect it to be any cost differential. So, overtime we don't see that being an issue but in the short-run we are making two skews instead of one and so there is always a little cost of complexity and it's just purely the volumes and the way we set-up the lines to run those. We have a very efficient high volume line for S20. We will be starting with low volume lines in the beginning and then those will cross over and then we would expect to see very similar margins.
Shawn Fitz – Stephens Inc.: Okay. Walt thanks for the help.
Walt Rosebrough: You bet.

Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss Associates: Hi Walt, how are you doing?
Walt Rosebrough: Good, you?
Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss Associates: Good, thanks. Just a quick question. Are you anticipating any pushback from the price increase you'll be taking on the 1E?
Walt Rosebrough: I think our price is very reasonable, I expect push back from customers on every price that we ever quote on every product we ever quote because there job is to do that for their institutions but I think when they look at the value that they are receiving for these products vis-à-vis anything else on the market. I think pricing is very, very reasonably.
Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss Associates: Okay. Great. And then, the guidance is obviously wide because there's so many variables. But maybe if you could just help us understand what's incorporated into the low end of guidance, what's incorporated into the high end of guidance, and what is the major swing factor there?
Walt Rosebrough: Well I have mentioned the factors and it's a mix and match of all those when we look at – we don't expect all the bad things to happen. We don't expect all the good things to happen. So, it is a mix and match but the major factors I have think have laid out pretty clearly in the discussion.
Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss Associates: Okay. And just quickly, on the $100 million charge that you broke out on the last call, you talked about this matrix you did. And is there any way you can give us insight into your estimates a little bit further into that matrix in terms of how many customers you assume take Tier 1 rebate versus Tier 2. Any metrics on that would be great?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, I think at this point we won't be doing that and I am not sure we actually will be going forward. But let us consider that and – but as we get more clarity in terms of the way our customers are moving across the metric. We can discuss that better with I think.
Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss Associates: Okay, great. And one last question. So, is there any way you can help us quantify the impact on your margins that you had from a lower percentage of lower margin capital equipment on the overall margin?
Walt Rosebrough: We don't give product specific margins but I think what the statement I made earlier about what our kind of gross margins would have been and what our EBIT would have been. I think we will stick that, I would make one comment and it may help clarify some extent on the metric. We do think the SYSTEM 1E is the best single one to one replacement for this device. And there is no device on the market in our view including anything else we sell. That is a straight one to one placement for SYSTEM 1 and system something else. But SYSTEM 1E we think is the closest thing to a straight one to one replacement and we believe that our customers will see that and we think it is very capital cost effective approach. So, we are expecting significant one to one conversion and the 1E is the highest total rebate in the equation. So, that does set some of that $100 million.
Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss Associates: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Heidi
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Joshua Zable, Natixis. Your line is open.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Thanks for taking my follow-ups here.
Walt Rosebrough: No problems.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Just some housekeeping, more housekeeping, just on the R&D side, you talked about this quarter, obviously, a big step up because of stuff going on quarter specific. As we think about next year, it seems like the $8 million a quarter is the right run rate. Is that the right way to think about it? Or should it step up or step down?
Walt Rosebrough:
 :
 :
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Okay. And in conjunction with that, because I know you gave us SG&A. On the GM, is there going to be some sort of – obviously we understand the components, why it's taking a hit. But is there going to be a progression over the year? I'm just trying to think about – because I know you guys have done a really good job of flattening earnings, for lack of a better word over the year. I am just wondering if SG&A is flat and R&D is generally where it's going to be, if we have a big hit in the early part of the year, are we going to offset that with SG&A, or is the gross margin hit going to be pretty evenly distributed over the course of the year.
Mike Tokich: Josh, as Walt mentioned earlier the distribution of our earnings will be 4% – 50% in first half remaining and the second half. So basically almost following where we were for fiscal ‘10 is our best estimate at this point in time.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: And that's primarily gross margin movement? Or is the SG&A going to coincide with that?
Mike Tokich:
 :
Joshua Zable – Natixis: But if customers pick it up faster, then the gross margin takes a hit earlier?
Mike Tokich: Correct. If they transition quicker, the gross margins will take a hit quicker if they transition longer in the year it will end up in the third or fourth quarter.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Okay great.
Mike Tokich: Or potentially next year depending on again the timing of this transition of the customers.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Very, very helpful. And I just want to follow-up to Shawn's question. Walt, I know we really appreciate all the level of detail, here and I know it does get confusing. And so, I just want to push a little bit more. You talked about 50% basically loss of SYSTEM 1. That's SYSTEM 1 and then you said that excludes SYSTEM 1E. So, in other words, I think it's safe to assume that you're going to get at least one customer to do SYSTEM 1 to SYSTEM 1E, probably a lot more. So, you obviously believe that there's less than 50% loss on that SYSTEM 1 revenue stream, and again getting back to sort of the number of devices, is what you're trying to say is that even if you put the 6,000 maximum devices out and you obviously have 20,000 out there. The makeup there with the numbers would be higher utilization on lower devices. Is that what you're saying? Even if customers transition from SYSTEM 1 to steam, you still lose that on the SYSTEM 1 revenue side. So, I'm just trying to reconcile those numbers. Thanks.
Walt Rosebrough: Exactly and Josh I would say let me re-characterize. When we talked about the SYSTEM 1 reduction being 50% greater, we are talking about the S20 Sterilant on its own. Not anything else and then we would expect the S1E capital and in the Sterilant that it will go along with, the S40 Sterilant that will go along with that to make up some portion of that and so that is – I will call that a gross number for a lack of better term as we close to a net number. And you are absolutely correct we do expect there to be significant number of customers that convert to S1E. It's our expectation that we will be capacity constrained certainly through fiscal '11. So, we think those customer conversions, our best estimate now is that those customer conversions will be capacity constraint and not order constraint.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: Bob Goldman, CL King. Your line is open, sir.
Bob Goldman – CL King: Thank you, again. I just decided to jump back in queue rather than due it off line. On the assumption that you're booking revenue when you ship a piece of capital equipment –
Walt Rosebrough: Absolutely. That's a good assumption.
Bob Goldman – CL King: And I assume that customers, when they put in an order, want the product yesterday?
Walt Rosebrough: That depends on their specific situation, but it is a general statement that's not the case. Generally they have things; it's a capital equipment; they have to plumb it. They have to get their system set for capital equipment. So, it varies, so some customers would want it yesterday and some would want it in three months of six months or nine months.
Bob Goldman – CL King: Okay, and this statement that the Company has worked to reduce the seasonal variability of capital shipments, which you're stating as impacting sales. It suggests to me that there were some products that perhaps could have been shipped at the end of the quarter that for whatever reason instead are going to be shipped in the first quarter.
Walt Rosebrough: Or that historically, we would work hard to ship everything we had at the end of quarters or end of years and we are not working so hard. That is if the customer didn't care, if the customer didn't care within a two or three week window, that we may have worked harder to get things shipped one day earlier if you will if they were indifferent. Now we are working to meet our customer demand and then to keep our volume as steady as we possibly can and still meet that customer demand. That's it in a nutshell.
Bob Goldman – CL King: So, the obvious follow-up then, Walt, is if you worked equally hard in the fourth quarter of 2010 that you did in the prior year, how much more sales would you have had on capital equipment in the fourth quarter?
Walt Rosebrough: I have no idea what that number would be, but, you are correct to assume that it would have been more and it wouldn't be – I basically I try to look at what the order rates, what the shipments are and overtime you would expect those to be the same or roughly the same and in fact overtime they will be the same. Our backlog grew about 7% year-over-year. So, I would not expect if all of that would have been shipped. I don't know the details enough around the numbers to know but clearly we are working to level our factories and meet customer demand.
Bob Goldman – CL King: Okay, thank you.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Bob.
Operator: At this time I am not showing any further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Julie Winter: This concludes our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us and have a great day.

===== 2010 Q1  (2009-12-09 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Andrew A. Krakauer – President Charles M. Diker – Chairman of the Board Craig A. Sheldon – Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Roy Malkin – President & Chief Executive Officer of Minntech Steven C. Anaya – Vice President & Controller
Analysts: Dalton Chandler – Needham & Company Jeffrey Cohen – C.K. Cooper & Co. Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co.  
Operator: Welcome to the Cantel Medical Corp. first quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce our host, Andrew Krakauer, President and CEO of Cantel Medical Corp. Thank you. You may now begin.
Andrew Krakauer :  Thank you and welcome to our first quarter fiscal year 2010 conference call. Before we start I would like to remind everyone that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including without limitations the risks detailed in the company’s filings and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements are only predictions and actual results may differ materially from those projected.   Okay, with that said again good morning to everyone. With me today on our call are Chuck Diker, Chairman of the Board; Craig Sheldon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Roy Malkin, President and CEO of our Minntech subsidiary; and Steve Anaya, VP and Controller of the company.  Cantel Medical reported another outstanding performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. In fact the company has now reported eight sequential quarters of improved earnings results and this quarter set all time financial performance records for the company. We reported first quarter earnings of $0.37 per share compared to the prior year’s first quarter earnings of $0.20 per share. This represents an 85% increase in net income.  As we pointed out in our press release, while all of our reporting segments showed improved gross margin and operating profit in the quarter this remarkable performance was significantly impacted by unusually high demand for our face masks driven by the H1N1 outbreak. I would like to thank all of our loyal and hard working employees for their great efforts and achievements again this quarter. These results reaffirm our overall strategic business direction, the rising importance and awareness of infection prevention and control in general, the effectiveness of our managers and staff and support our continued optimism about the future of Cantel with or without atypical demand for any one particular product.  Before I turn it over to Craig to discuss some specific financial details, I will briefly review the major operating segments.  Our best performance for the quarter was in Healthcare Disposables, where on a 31% increase in sales, operating profit increased by 145% over the prior year’s first quarter. This success was primarily driven by increased sales of face masks, hand sanitizers and surface disinfection wipes as a result of the pandemic nature of the novel H1N1 virus. Our Crosstex subsidiary is one of the largest US based manufacturers of FDA cleared face masks and while a virus such as the novel H1N1 is tough to predict and its status can change very quickly, the CDC has recently indicated that the influenza activity has begun to decrease in the United States and as a result we anticipate that the previously elevated demand for face masks is now returning to normal levels for now. However, we are working on a number of activities to grow this particular product area including our very active alternate channel program that offers solutions to businesses and public entities to be properly prepared for any pandemic outbreak which of course would include having an adequate supply of face masks. We are also working with federal and state officials as they plan for proper stockpiling of face masks although at this time they have not placed any orders.  Additionally during the quarter we launched our new antimicrobial coated face mask outside of the United States. Our BIOSAFE brand coated mask offers tangible advantages to users and while we are still waiting for specific guidelines for the FDA to allow for sales in the United States, we have received great interest in this new product in a number of international markets.  In an effort to isolate the impact of this H1N1 driven uptick for us we estimate revenue in our healthcare disposables segment grew organically between 3-5% in the quarter which is above the basically flat dental market growth rate and this success is attributable to our substantially increased investments in sales and marketing.  Our endoscopic processing business which has performed well for all of fiscal year 2009 started fiscal year 2010 with another great, strong performance. Sales grew by 19% in the quarter as shipments were higher in all categories including equipment, consumables such as disinfectant cleaners, as well as service parts and accessories. Growth in equipment sales was particularly positive in light of the lingering weakness in hospital equipment purchases generally.  Another positive note was our substantial success in all product categories in markets outside of the United States. I continue to be impressed with the achievements of our direct hospital sales and service force in the United States. In this fiscal year we are continuing to invest significantly in sales, marketing and service resources to continue growing the business. We are optimistic as we have started to see good customer acceptance of our new, state of the art Advantage Plus machines with a new single use peracetic acid-based chemistry. We are also excited about the prospects for our internationally launched, mid-range single use chemistry reprocessor, the DSD [Etch] which is now approved throughout the world except in the United States where we are waiting for feedback from the FDA on our initial submission.  On a different subject, since last week we have received several requests from analysts and investors for information concerning our recent notice issued by the FDA in reference to the continued use of Steris’ System 1 Endoscope reprocessor, a competitive product to ours. At this time it is unclear what Steris customer reaction will be to the FDA’s guidance to employ alternative methods for their hospital’s device reprocessing needs. Judging from initial hospital inquiries to us we expect to gain some additional business but we can’t predict how much incremental sales we will obtain at this time. I will certainly have more information next quarter to talk about with what is going on in the marketplace related to Steris.  In the dialysis segment, as expected, sales declined primarily due to reductions of low margin dialysate concentrate shipments mostly in the U.S. Nevertheless with the continued strength of our worldwide reuse business including Renatron automated reprocessing equipment and Renalin Sterilant and with the expert management of manufacturing and distribution costs, operating profit actually increased by 31% in the first quarter despite the 10% decline in sales, a great importance.  Our water purification and filtration segment performed well this quarter as well. Sales were higher by 2% but operating income was higher by 23%. This performance is similar to the way our Marco Water Purification and filtration business is performing over last year. That is, steady profit improvement despite weakness in capital equipment sales due to the economy. We have been significantly growing our sales of higher margin parts, sterilants and filters and expanding our service revenue.  This mix shift has been one of the key strategies for the water purification business and this success has more than offset the continued softness in capital equipment sales and the net effect is that gross margins are improving. I remain positive about the future of our water purification and filtration business and we have demonstrated our capability to find growth and improved margins despite the challenges of the economic slowdown. We are also seeing a pickup in quotation activity in our capital equipment area and I am optimistic that this side of the business will improve by mid-year 2010.  Additionally in this segment we have successfully launched new products this year and have more in development. Last quarter we discussed the success of our new Teflon distribution loop system for dialysis clinics. This success of our now branded Micro Free Distribution Loop System continues to grow. We have also begun shipments of our actual peracetic acid product which is a proven sporacidal surface disinfection chemistry to be used for clean room disinfection at a major multi-national pharmaceutical company.  Further, I am very pleased with the integration of our recent Los Angeles, California based acquisition G.E.M. Water Systems. Our customers have welcomed the combination of G.E.M.’s products with Marcor’s service network. We have already brought in a new West Coast Service Leader and have just opened a branch office in San Francisco so we are expanding our business in the west coast, helped by this acquisition.  We will continue to look for synergistic acquisitions in the water purification area and new products and to expand our service coverage in the United States. That concludes the four major segments. Let me turn it over to Craig who will discuss some of the financial details and I will come back with a few summary comments. 
Craig Sheldon :  Thank you Andy. Good morning everyone. What I would like to do is move through the press release that was issued this morning and start with some comments on the income statement.  As you can see, sales were very strong in the first quarter and increased by 10.2% compared to last year’s first quarter. As Andy indicated before we had outstanding top line growth in the first quarter from both healthcare disposables as well as endoscope reprocessing. Gross profit, last year we continued to mention gross profit was one of the areas we wanted to focus on and you can clearly see the results in the GP area continue to be very, very strong.  Our gross profit percentage was 41.5% in the first quarter. That is well up from the 36.7% in last year’s first quarter and really an extraordinary 4.8 increase in gross margin points. 4.8 points. So very good performance. This GP percentage is the highest ever for our current business and represents the sixth consecutive quarter we have reported improvement in gross profit percentage compared to the immediately preceding quarter. This illustrates our continued efforts to improve sales mix and drive efficiencies.  So as we break down gross profit we really benefited from several key items. You will probably these as being somewhat carry-over’s from last year. Number one is very favorable product mix. We have had good sales of high margin products such as disinfectant and consumables and endoscope reprocessing, sterilants and filters in our water purification filtration segment and of course face masks and healthcare disposables. Additionally, the decline in dialysis sales is almost entirely in the area of our lowest margin domestic concentrated sales.  Number two, customer price increases in certain key product areas, some of them are carry-overs from last year. This coupled with a decrease in certain raw material distribution costs primarily due to the lower cost of oil and fuel compared to last year’s first quarter. Three, improved efficiency in our manufacturing, transportation and service functions. This includes the prior year relocation of our Dutch manufacturing operations.  So those really are the three primary areas. Obviously when you have a big increase in sales and you combine that with drastic improvement in gross profit percentage, what you are getting is an enormous overall pickup in gross profit dollars which increased by $5.8 million in the first quarter. That is up by 25% compared to last year’s first quarter. Certainly, our ability to sustain this level of gross profit percentage is highly dependent on many factors including overall sales volume, sales mix including the level of healthcare disposables products and the price of oil.  Moving down the income statement, take a quick look at operating expenses. They were extremely well controlled and we will continue to better leverage these expenses against incremental sales. Gross operating expenses increased by $1.7 million for the first quarter which is an increase of 9.5% compared to the prior-year quarter. This increase is concentrated primarily in two areas. Number one, variable expenses and stock compensation directly related to the strong performance of the company. Two, as Andy mentioned before planned investments in the selling and R&D areas including an increase in personnel necessary to pursue a number of strategic initiatives.  As we stated on the fourth quarter conference call a number of these initiatives within operating expenses are not expected to contribute to our sales growth this year but are clearly investments for future growth and we should see some of those benefits in fiscal 2011.  Looking at operating income overall reporting a 68% increase in operating income compared to last year’s first quarter and operating margins of over 14% for the quarter. Really a tremendous performance. This compares with operating margin of about 11% for the full fiscal year 2009. You only have to go back a few years when margins were below 10%. When the form 10-Q is filed tomorrow evening you will see that all of our segments turned in very solid growth for the first quarter.  Interest expense decreased by 44% in the first quarter compared to last year’s first quarter and this is a continuation of our pattern of quarter-to-quarter reductions. These decreases are reflective of continual repayment over the course of the past year and reduced interest rate. All of our debt is on LIBOR contract at very favorable rates extending well into fiscal year 2010 so we will be well protected as the year progresses. We will definitely continue to see meaningful reductions in both outstanding borrowings and interest expense throughout fiscal 2010.  A quick look at income tax, overall the effective rate was 38.2% in the first quarter which we believe to be a very normal rate. As I have mentioned in the past, due to the international scope of our operations, the uncertainty of future statutory tax rate changes and generally the overall complexity of the tax area it is extremely difficult to precisely predict what our future overall effective tax rate will be. However, having said that since the bulk of our income is generated in the United States where our effective rate in the first quarter was 38.1% and when we look back at the full fiscal year 2009 our US effective rate was 38.6%, we definitely feel very confident an overall effective rate of around 38% going forward should be achieved.  Moving onto the balance sheet, it continues to remain very strong. $23.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. Working capital was $32 million at October 31 which is down from $49.8 million at the end of July. The current ratio of 1.5 to 1 at October 1 which is down from 2.3 to 1 at the end of July. Now, it is very important to mention that the reduction both in the working capital as well as the current ratio is entirely due to the reclassification of our debt.  As we indicated at year-end the revolving portion of our debt of $20.5 million at the end of the quarter has now been reclassified to current due to the fact the expiration date of August 1, 2010 is now less than one year away. So of course according to the accounting rules we had to move that from long-term to current. We are in very active discussions with our banking syndicate about an amendment to this facility and we fully expect to complete an amendment in the spring.  Our funded debt was $38 million at the end of October. This is down from $43.3 million at July 31. Again, reflecting back two years ago, at October 31, 2007 and this was a point in time where we just completed three acquisitions, our outstanding debt was $70.5 million so our borrowings at the end of October was down by almost one-half over this two year period. In fact, we repaid $3 million just last week so today it is actually $35 million so it is exactly one-half of where our debt position was two years ago.  We continue to pay down significant levels of debt. We paid down $5.3 million in the first quarter and we expect at least this level of pay down or perhaps more during the second quarter. Our net debt was $14.9 million at October 31. This is down from $19.9 million at July 31. So this improvement in the first quarter is despite the fact that the first quarter is traditionally a very heavy cash usage quarter for the company.  Our gross debt to equity is just under 0.2 at October 31 and our gross debt to rolling 12-month EBITDAS is now well under 1.0, in fact it is 0.82 so very strong performance there.  A quick look at cash flow which is the third page of the press release, EBITDAS was $14 million in the first quarter which was 46% ahead of last year’s first quarter EBITDAS. Cash flow provided by operations was $6.5 million in the first quarter and free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures was $5.1 million. So every measure you look at demonstrates very strong cash generation capabilities.  As I mentioned a moment ago we will be filing our 10-Q on its normal schedule tomorrow evening. At this point I will turn the call back over to Andy for some closing remarks. Andy?
Andrew Krakauer :  Thanks Craig. In summary this quarter has been a particularly great success for the company much of it driven by this atypical demand due to the H1N1 outbreak. Given the increasing levels of vaccine supply and the recent abatement in influenza cases, I anticipate a return to historic levels of purchasing for our face masks for now. We do not give specific guidance but I expect Cantel to return to a more normal level of business for now in general.  However, I do note this pandemic has raised global public awareness around the importance of infection prevention and control and we continue to see future opportunities ahead as healthcare professionals, governments and the general public embrace the seriousness and the need for greater attention to preventing the acquisition and transmission of infection.  Specifically on H1N1, obviously I cannot predict what is going to happen more than anybody else can. At the moment it seems to be abating but none of us can predict what is going to happen in the traditional flu season January through March. We know that there are a lot of people that are not taking the H1N1 flu shot because they are afraid to take it. Maybe nothing will happen or maybe it will mutate, or it could expand in the winter months. These are all future things that we will just have to wait and see what happens. For now our commercial channels have been satisfied with their supplies.  My take-away from this quarter is that Cantel has tremendous earnings capability in its portfolio. We did make $0.37 with the products that we have and sell. We are always looking for ways to maximize these opportunities whether they are short-term, medium or long-term. We will capitalize on these opportunities opportunistically just as we did with face masks in this quarter and the fourth quarter of last year.  More importantly we are proactively working to develop many more of these prospects and we will [go over that] whether it be more disposables or equipment or chemistry. We are continuing our initiative to increase the profitable growth of the company into the future. The main strategy for fiscal year 2010 is to substantially increase R&D and technology spending as well as our sales and marketing investments and continue our effective acquisition program. What we are talking about here are several million dollars of incremental investments which we believe are appropriate expenditures to make for our future growth.  Besides adding greater marketing and sales strength and coverage to various businesses, these investments are designed to greatly accelerate our R&D efforts in liquid chemical germicides, development of new equipment in water purification and endoscoping processing, accelerating our advancement of new and novel filter applications, increasing our efforts in the alternate channel development and aggressively looking for strategic acquisitions.  With these greater investments we hope to further accelerate the growth rate of the company in fiscal year 2011 and beyond. While we are making these investments for the future our base business is solid. Every segment is performing well with our focus on growing disposables, parts and service, which now make up 75% of our revenue and because we sell somewhat recession buffered products we have a solid base with cash producing businesses from which to grow.  On another note we were pleased to announce this quarter that Cantel was chosen by the S&P index selection committee to be included in the S&P Small Cap 600 Index. This is a significant positive statement about Cantel Medical. The criteria to be selected include many factors including specific earnings and trading volume guidelines but the net conclusion is that to be selected a company must have a market capitalization between $200 million and $1 billion and be investment grade quality. We believe this exhibits a certain value about Cantel that will make it more attractive to investors. Cantel is now also in the S&P 1500 Index as well.  Before I take any questions let me close by telling you we are still very excited about the prospects of Cantel Medical. We look forward to implementing our strategic growth plan that we are working on now and we are committed to profitably growing the company while serving our customers and benefiting our shareholders. With that, I will open the call to questions.  
 :
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler – Needham & Company. 
Dalton Chandler – Needham & Company: Let me start by asking a little bit about your comments on the disposables business and your expectation it will return to a more normal growth pattern. First of all should we assume that is going to happen in the current quarter or do you think you have a little bit more unusual growth from H1N1? Secondly, you talked about 3-5% organic growth in the quarter. Is that what you expect it to return to? 
Andrew Krakauer :  Let me answer your second one first. We think at the moment until unemployment picks up and the dental market starts to resume its historical 3-5% growth that as we get organic growth of 3-5% in what effectively is a flat to down market that is a good rate for us on an organic basis. I think that is probably a good way of looking at our base business in healthcare disposables. As far as masks go, I would view the second quarter as likely and again I can’t be specific today. I don’t really know exactly and be a little more specific than we normally get but my best thought would be to assume we are at somewhat normal levels in the second quarter because while there is clearly some commercial business that is still being generated by some distributors, others are at full in their channel and may actually be slightly less than normal. So I prefer to think about it as a normal quarter for healthcare disposables.
Dalton Chandler – Needham & Company: You also had a really strong quarter in endoscope reprocessing. Can you give us any color on that and what you would expect going forward there? 
Andrew Krakauer :  I think in general we have continued to add resources in both sales and marketing in that business so we are getting better coverage. We have launched several new products and the sales force I think is just getting better. I don’t want to make any prediction other than I would be disappointed if we didn’t continue with at least some version of double digit growth. 
Dalton Chandler – Needham & Company: On the pickup in the gross margin you did mention mix was a big part of that. As the disposables returns to its more normalized growth pattern, what do you think is going to happen to the gross margin? 
Craig Sheldon :  I think as a general statement, we have moved our business now for awhile to where we have about 75% consumable type products, consumables and service versus 25% capital equipment. As long as the capital equipment continues to not be quite at the levels we want such as our water business, we should be able to stay relatively close to the gross profit percentage but clearly I think it is a hard statement to make that these mask sales return to more normal levels it will be hard to be at that 41 plus percent gross profit percentage. We will probably be lower than that but we still expect to be very high. We definitely have a different business model than we had several years ago. 
Dalton Chandler – Needham & Company: Any sense of when you might have the BIOSAFE mask on the market in the US? 
Andrew Krakauer :  I would say we cannot give an estimate there. We are still certainly months. Probably several months away from a submission to the FDA. Whether or not we get guidelines or not and that could take several months. The FDA is very unpredictable. It has been almost 3 years since they initially, we submitted recommendations to their guidelines for antimicrobial coatings for masks over two years ago. I don’t know the answer to that question. My guess is it is really a 2011 story, not a 2010 story as far as the US. 
Dalton Chandler – Needham & Company: A final housekeeping question, can you give us the CapEx for the quarter? 
Craig Sheldon :  CapEx for the quarter was approximately $1.4 million which is very normal by historical standards and pretty much right on the money with what we spent last year in the first quarter. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen – C.K. Cooper & Co.
Jeffrey Cohen – C.K. Cooper & Co.: I have one housekeeping question and one other question. First of on the housekeeping side, could you discuss the common shares and diluted shares for the quarter? 
Craig Sheldon :  In terms of the gross number of those shares? 
Jeffrey Cohen – C.K. Cooper & Co.: Yes. 
Craig Sheldon :  The diluted shares for the quarter were 16,768,000 and the basic shares were 16,650,000. 
Jeffrey Cohen – C.K. Cooper & Co.: The second question is for this quarter and probably for what you project for 2010 overseas sales as a percentage of gross sales. Do you expect that number to increase? I know it has been around 20% if I am not mistaken. 
Andrew Krakauer :  I would expect it to be fairly constant. I am still expecting some significant success in the U.S. which will keep the percentage where it is even as we get successful in some areas internationally. For example that pharmaceuticals business I was talking about at the moment is starting out in Europe. But I hope to see the US growing as well. I would say it is going to be pretty much the same although I do believe international growth is an opportunity. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co.: As you go through the next couple of years I think right now about 75 % of the business is recurring because it is consumables. Do you see that moving up materially from here? 
Andrew Krakauer :  Let me just put it this way. I would not be unhappy if we were able to grow those businesses and develop the chemistry that would start moving that number beyond 75%. On the other hand, I would not be unhappy if our equipment sales start returning to significant growth as the economic conditions around the world improve. So if everything was growing and the equipment businesses were returning and we stayed at 75% I would still [still be happy] but I think in general I see that number probably still increasing a bit. 
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co.: You did touch on acquisitions. Looking at the balance sheet clearly you have the ability to go and finance something pretty sizeable. I don’t know if you could give us a sense of any areas or what I kind of the overall strategy is for an acquisition? 
Andrew Krakauer :  We are very actively looking for acquisitions led by Seth here. Let me just give you flavor. We are looking at several different areas. We would like to continue to add both products and service coverage in the water business plus with what we have just done with G.E.M. That is one. We are looking in general for acquisitions that could help us in our liquid chemical germicide businesses with products that can be sold throughout all the sales forces we have and all the different markets we have completed. And we also have a particular focus and are interested in companies that are in some ways related to helping us expand into the hospital business in general. So those are our big categories. 
Operator:  There appear to be no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any closing comments. 
Andrew Krakauer :  Again thanks everybody for listening. I look forward to speaking to everybody on our second quarter fiscal year 2010 conference call in March. Thanks again. Goodbye. 
Operator:  This does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the STERIS fiscal 2009 third quarter conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce today's host, Julie Winter, Manager, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\
Julie Winter: Thank you, Valerie, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to STERIS Corporation's Fiscal 2009 Third Quarter Conference Call.

Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Julie and good morning to all of you joining us. I’m going to start today with a high-level review of our observations and two year outlook. Then Mike will walk you through the results in more detail.  Our third quarter saw more revenue growth of 2%, led by growth in our healthcare business. Our constant currency growth was 4%, but was reduced by the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We were able to leverage this modest top-line growth the deliver substantial year-over-year improvements in profitability.  Over the past couple of years, beginning with our transfer of manufacturing operations from Erie to Mexico, plus our cost-reduction efforts within North America, and the international restructuring announced this morning, we have implemented programs to reduce our cost structure by approximately $70 million. I want to emphasize that these reductions are generally in administrative expenses, lower production costs, or within products or markets that were not generating profitability. We have continued to invest in product development and field sales and service forces to provide our customer superior products and services. Thanks to the great work of our people, we are ahead of schedule realizing these savings, which has helped generate the results we are reporting today.  Now I’ll spend just a few minutes reviewing each segment. Our healthcare segment grew 4%, driven primarily by new products. For the first time this year, we are seeing a slowdown in spending from our healthcare customers, which is impacting our order growth rate. In particular, our infection prevention products have slowed somewhat as hospital budgets tighten; however we saw strong growth in our surgical business, driven by new products with continued strength in both LED lights and our integrated OR platform.  In total, our healthcare team has created another backlog record this quarter, with growth in both infection prevention and surgical products. Even to now, we are not seeing cancellation of orders or delays in shipments beyond the routine. So order cancellations are not materially impacting our business.  You may have seen our announcement last week that we have submitted a new product to the FDA for 510(k) clearance. Normally, we would not pre-announce a product before its release, but in this instance, we felt it important to let our customers understand the direction we are taking. We are pleased that our discussions with the agency have resulted in this submission for a new liquid chemical sterilization system and a path for it in resolving the warning letter related to System 1.  While the timing of regulatory clearance is uncertain, and our talks are continuing with the government, we look forward to reporting back to you with more details as we know them.  Moving to the life science segment, now led by Greg Blackmore, it saw substantial decline in capital equipment, which is partially timing. As we’ve told you in the past, as a result of large capital equipment orders, it tends to be lumpier than our other segments.  In addition, we made a strategic decision earlier in the year to focus on higher margin capital equipment products, which is impacting revenue growth negatively and our profits positively. Our margin improvement in this business is substantial as the life science team has done a nice job managing projects and reducing expenses to drive profitability improvement.  Finally, our isomedix segment reported another solid quarter. This is particularly true, given the sale of one of our facilities this year. Although flat in revenue for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, growth was 5% excluding the impact of the facility sale. As in the other two segments, our isomedix people manage cost to grow slowly than revenue so profit grew faster than revenue.  We are updating our guidance for fiscal 2009 given the results of this past quarter and the uncertainty we face in the upcoming months. As I told you last quarter, we have made operational changes to level our production and to reduce the historic heavy fourth quarter seasonality in our business, which in the second half of this year will have a negative impact on our comparisons, purely due to timing, even without any consideration of the current economic climate.  We now anticipate that revenue growth will be approximately 4% for the year, driven by mid-single digit growth in the healthcare segment, low single digits in isomedix, and a slight decline in life science. You will recall that life science had an extraordinary fourth quarter last year.  As far as the bottom line, we are quite comfortable with our recent earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.80 per diluted share. In fact, we feel it should be toward the higher end of the range. That forecast assumes a modest increase in raw materials and currency exchange rates on a forward basis as of mid-December, 2008.  As you know, we have worked to be conservative in our forecast of revenue, exchange rates, and cost increases, given the wide variations we have seen in the past year or so. We have been fortunate up until this point that currency and material costs have gone our way the past several months, which have helped improve our earnings.  At the beginning of this fiscal year, we were also concerned about changes in healthcare spending given a change in administration in Washington and potential for uncertainty. So we operated our business conservatively, even in the face of what seemed to be a very strong market. I am pleased with the work the STERIS people have done to position us to continue profitable growth, even in this tougher environment.  Since the outlook going forward is less than certain, even for our fiscal year fourth quarter, and certainly for our next fiscal year, we will continue to run our business conservatively, operating for a non-growth environment, while working to grow our business in that environment. We will continue our efforts to control costs and expect continued success doing so, but we will not sacrifice our future. We do not plan to disinvest in product development or customer facing people so we can make sure we provide our customers with quality products and services in the coming months and years.  I will now hand the call over to Mike Tokich who will review the numbers in more detail. 
Michael Tokich: Thank you, Walt. Good morning everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to discuss our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Before I get into the details, there are a few moving parts in our numbers.  So for clarity, let me remind you that included in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 is a pretax charge of $12.3 million with 2.8 million of the charge reported as restructuring expenses and $9.5 million is recorded in cost of goods sold. The charge is primarily related to our international operations and consists of costs associated with several severance and related benefits, the rationalization of certain product lines, and the closure of sales offices.  These actions, which continue our focus on improving our cost structure, are anticipated to generate annualized savings of approximately $20 million. We anticipate these savings will be realized over the next couple of years, with approximately $4 million benefiting fiscal 2009, approximately $10 million benefiting fiscal 2010, and remainder benefiting fiscal 2011 and beyond.  Also during the quarter, we made changes to certain benefit policies, which resulted in a pretax income of $7.9 million. The change in policy related to our paid time off benefit, which is now earned throughout the calendar year rather than granted in a lump sum at the beginning of the calendar year.  The net impact of these two items resulted in a reduction of pretax income of $4.4 million. Discussion of the third quarter financial results will exclude both the charges in fiscal 2009 and 2008 as well as the adjustment for benefit changes in 2009.  Overall, third quarter revenue increased 2%. Organic growth for the quarter was 4% with 2% for volume and 2% for pricing. Foreign currency translation had a -2% impact. Gross margin in the quarter was 41.8%, an increase of 150 basis points compared with the third quarter of last year. Pricing, productivity improvements, and favorable currency exchange rates were partially offset by increases in raw material costs.  Earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter was 15.7%, an increase of more than 450 basis points compared with the prior year period.  The increase in EBIT is driven by the improvements in gross margin, lower operating expense levels, and favorable currency exchange rates. As a reminder, due to our geographic locations, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar tends to reduce our revenue growth, but for the same level of revenue, provides a benefit to our operating income. In this quarter, that benefit was approximately $6 million.  Effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.5% compared with 33.1% in the prior year quarter. That income increased 38% and was $31.3 million or $0.53 per diluted share compared with net income of $22.6 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.  Healthcare increased 4% in the quarter, driven by a 6% increase in capital equipment revenue and a 5% increase in service revenue. Capital equipment order backlog levels increased 25% to a record $134 million as compared to the same period last year. The healthcare segment operating margin rate was 15.9% compared with 13.9% in the same quarter last year. The improvement in operating margin rate was driven by increased volumes and improved operating expense leverage.  Life science revenue declined 6% compared with the prior year. As solid growth in consumables and service of 7% and 5% was more than offset by the declines in capital equipment of 21%. The capital decline was driven by a continued slow-down in spending from our pharmaceutical customers as well as a business decision to improve the profitability of our capital equipment revenue.  Backlog levels for life sciences declined 14% to $50 million as compared with the same period last year. Life sciences operating margin rate was 15.7% compared with 4.2% in the same quarter last year. The improvement in operating margin rate was driven by higher gross margin attainment and lower operating expense levels. Isomedix services revenue increased 0.3% in the quarter. Revenue growth was affected by the sale of one facility earlier in the year. Isomedix operating margin rate was 22.2% compared with 20.3% in the prior year period. The increase in margin rate reflects modest price increases combined with lower operating expenses.  Turning to the balance sheet, our DSO level at 59 days was flat as compared to the third quarter of last year. Total inventory at quarter-end was $148.1 million compared with $164.4 million in the prior year quarter. Inventory write downs associate with a third quarter charge for product rationalization decisions contributed $8 million to the decline in inventory.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.8 million and depreciation and amortization was $14.3 million. During the quarter, the first installment of $40 million on our 2003 private placement matured and was repaid. Our long-term debt is now $210 million with our next scheduled maturity in 2013. Net debt at quarter-end was $104.2 million representing a net debt to total capital ratio of 12.7%. Free cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was $89.6 million compared with free cash flow of $60.5 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement in cash flow largely reflects the increase in earnings, lower capital spending, and the sale of an isomedix facility, which added $9.5 million to free cash flow. Since the beginning of this fiscal year, we have repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of $30.74. Approximately 204 million remains under our current share repurchase authorization.  This concludes my review of our third quarter results. I will now turn things back over to Julie to begin our Q&A portion of the call.
Julie Winter : Thank you Walt and Mike for your comments. We are now ready to begin the Q&A session, so Valerie would you please give the instructions and we’ll begin.  
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mr. Zable from Natixis. Sir, you may ask your question. 
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: Thanks very much. Hi guys, congratulations on a super quarter here especially in a tough environment and thanks for taking my call here.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks Josh.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: I have got a couple of questions. I’ll try to run through it. First of all, Mike, just some housekeeping here, I know you said foreign exchange hit you guys 2%. I’m not sure if you were just referring to the top line specifically or all together. So could you just explain because I thought a stronger U.S. dollar would help you guys on bottom line? Maybe I’m just mishearing it. And then maybe you could walk us through some of your assumptions for next year and how to think about how that can flow through. 
Michael Tokich : Certainly Josh, from an FX impact on the third quarter itself, revenue was negatively impacted by 2% or approximately $7 million. Bottom line, however, was actually impacted positively by $6 million. So because of our geographic locations, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will actually reduce revenue growth but provide a benefit to us on the bottom line for the quarter.  For the year, it is not as dramatic. We did see revenue impacted favorably by a million dollars or less than 1%. And then from the operating income standpoint year-to-date, we had favorable of about $3.5 million for the full year. So once again, revenue was impacted negatively but we do get a bigger bottom line impact on the operating income standpoint as the dollar strengthens. Looking forward into the fourth quarter here, we’re anticipating - again, the three major currencies that we focus on are the Canadian dollar, the euro, and the peso - the euro will get slightly better, the Canadian dollar will be flat, and we’ll see a slight decrease in the peso based upon our mid-December foreign currency rates. 
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: And that 7 million to 6 million kind of ratio, was that the right ratio to think about top and bottom line? If we want to watch the currency rates, how will that help you or hit. 
Michael Tokich: It really depends on which currencies and how much volatility there is on those currencies. So I don’t think I can give you a “ratio” that would be useful because I would be wrong. 
Walt Rosebrough: Josh, the euro affects us both ways, revenue and costs, but the peso and Canadian dollar tend to affect us (inaudible) on the cost side. So that’s the way to think about it. 
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay, very helpful guys. So a couple of questions here, Walt, while we’re doing the housekeeping, I know you said you want to make the year less seasonal. We’ve obviously seen a tick up here, Q1, Q2, Q3, not talking about the guidance at the end of the year, but even thinking about next year (inaudible) or just in general, should we see it that there’s still a ramp but there’s much less of a ramp or as we kind of think about going forward, should it really be flattened out across the quarters? I guess I’m just trying to see if $0.50 is the right baseline kind of number to think going forward or it’s really still a ramp a little bit. 
Walt Rosebrough: Josh, first of all, we’re not forecasting next year yet. It’s a tough time to be forecasting anything. But let me answer your question generally and then we’ll come back. If we were going to grow 10%, I would expect that 10% growth to be much more ratable across the year than 0, 2%, 2%, 12%, that kind of thing. So in general, in a 10% growing year, we would hope to grow each quarter 10% from the previous year in more of a flat-line environment because that is the best, lowest cost way to operate our facilities. So that’s the way we would like it to be.  Now, unfortunately customers don’t always order things when we want to build then, so we obviously rely on customers and whether next year will be an increasing year in total demand or a decreasing year in total demand is still a question to be answered. 
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: I guess what I’m trying to get at is as you’ve been there and all of you have implemented the programs and obviously done great things here, is the ramp in earnings more of a function of these programs and more of the focus on profitability being just nine months old as opposed to six months old or is there still an element of seasonality here in any way, shape, or form?
Walt Rosebrough: Josh, I don’t see a significant element of seasonality is the best way to answer the question. 
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay, and then just to the business here, you guys –
Walt Rosebrough: Josh, I take that back. I was thinking more about capital when I said that. In terms of consumables there should be a slight seasonality that mirrors the acute care seasonality, which tends to be a little bit stronger in the first quarter. Hospitals tend to kind of ramp up in terms of missions and use and all that stuff between late summer and March, taking a little bit of a break in December, and they tend to kind of ramp down between and that’s just their normal seasonality. So our supply should follow something close to that. 
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: And that’s actually one of the questions I had. Considering how well you did in equipment in this environment, consumables weren’t stellar - they were obviously up just a little bit - but is that just a function of seasonality then? 
Walt Rosebrough: I think it’s a function of seasonality and I think we’ve seen hospital admissions and days a little soft in the November, December, January time-frame. 
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: And then on the equipment piece and then I’ll get to the back of the queue here, you guys made some comments. You obviously have very, very strong backlog on equipment, which is really, really impressive.  And you actually made a comment that the backlog grew in both surgical and infection control. And I thought I had read in the press release something to the tune of that infection control equipment sales weren't great but surgical were very good. And I'm assuming that had to do with new products.  And so I'm just wondering if you saw sort of a pause maybe in December like everyone else and maybe things picked up in January on both fronts or can you just kind of talk about the dynamics between the different equipment. And when you say surgical are you talking about the V-PRO or are you talking about sort of tables and lights?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, surgical tables, lights, OR integration think the things that you would generally expect to see in a surgical suite as opposed to in the central supply area. 
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay. 
Unidentified Company Representative: And V-PRO is typically in the central supply area. And so that's the way we break it. But the answer is the revenue was not as strong in Q3 for infection control and the orders roughly approximated the revenue, actually slightly greater that's why backlog grew. So backlog did indeed grow, it did not grow as quickly as surgical which had both a very strong shipment quarter and a very strong earnings quarter or excuse me orders quarter. 
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder: Great, okay, well I'll let some other people ask some questions here. Thanks, guys, congrats. 
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Josh. 
Operator:  Mr. Macosko from Lord Abbett you may ask your question.
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett:  Yes, thank you, could you talk a little bit about the 70 million in terms of the cost reduction? It sounds as if you've done sort of realized or have in place 20, what's the time frame on that 70 and give me some feeling for that?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well it's really that's kind of the last 18 to 24 months of work. Some of which much of which we have already seen. About 20 million of it relates to the Mexico to or Erie to Mexico movement and we will have captured that full 20 – I mean that's annualized but we will have hit that full run rate this year.  The second was the restructuring we did largely in North America last year. And again we said that we would get about 30 million in total between 15 and 20 this year. And as I mentioned we are ahead of schedule on that. And then the last 20 roughly is the 20 we just announced today, largely international and we will get four or five yet this year.  And then the balance over the next couple of years. 
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett:  So the 70 million is in place in – by the end of this calendar year or something? Is that?
Unidentified Company Representative : Much of it in place, exactly. 
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: Okay, all right, thank you very much. 
Unidentified Company Representative : As we mentioned the last 20, 15 of it is not in place. That actual work may be done but we won't have seen much of the benefit yet this year. 
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: But it will be all realized in – 2000 fiscal 11 is what I think, right?
Unidentified Company Representative :  Yes. 
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: Okay. 
Unidentified Company Representative : And most by fiscal 10. 
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: Okay, okay, good, thank you. And then with regard to the new liquid chemical sterilization 5/10 K that you mentioned. Is that focused on both on the surgical suite and non-surgical applications of sterilization in clinics and the like?
Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, let me answer the question two ways just to make sure I'm clear on the question. System 1 which is the product we currently have it commonly found in surgical suites, as well as, in more like in simple sterile.  But it because of the Just In Time system it tends to be at or near the surgical areas. So it is indeed found in surgical suites, just outside surgical suites, and in ambulatory surgery centers if that's the way you're asking the question. 
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: Yes. 
Unidentified Company Representative : And again without we're not going to talk too much about this product because we don’t know everything and it's not yet cleared. But in general you would expect it to be System 1 like if you will.
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: And is the idea for it to cover a broader range in the product area or broader applications within the hospital and clinic then?
Unidentified Company Representative : You know what I probably am not going to go any further than what I have done. But the System 1 itself does carry a reasonably broad range but it's mainly focused on endoscopy and like devices. 
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: And then finally if you please the – with regard to the you mentioned the life sciences area and you know that capital equipment was down 21% or something. Was the idea that you basically discontinued some product lines because of their non-profitability? The profitability rose a great deal is that kind of where it came from because your bonds were down in capital equipment because you basically got rid of low margin product?
Unidentified Company Representative : We have discontinued some low margin product and as importantly a lot of that product is call it engineering spec as opposed to so more of a custom like product than a standard type product? And we've been moving towards standard type product because the cost relationship of doing some of that custom engineering just hasn't paid off.  So if we're not going to get paid for that custom engineering we're not going to do it. And so it's just a mixture of those two things.  
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett:  And so when will the ramp down in this change in product line in capital equipment kind of be comparable year-over-year basis?
Unidentified Company Representative : I think we're probably pretty much there. 
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: So in other words the fourth quarter of fiscal '09 is kind of an apples-to-apples comparison or close to it. 
Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, I would guess even the third and fourth quarter of next year would be apples-to-apples. We've been working on this a while. I honestly don't know there – a lot of that is along (inaudible) time. And I've not done the math on that to determine how much of the old is still passing through and the new is coming on.  But I just haven't personally done it, I don’t know, Mike, if you've seen that but I would guess certainly next year it will happen. 
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: Okay, so basically sort of the first half of fiscal 10 we'll still see some negative capital equipment revenue comparisons. 
Unidentified Company Representative : All things being equal, yes.
Greg Macosko – Lord Abbett: Okay, I understand but, okay thank you. 
Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, what you're searching for the answer I think is yes. 
Operator: Mr. Owczarski from Avondale Partners you may ask your question. 
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Yes, thanks, good morning. 
Unidentified Company Representative : Good morning. 
Unidentified Company Representative : Good morning. 
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Can you talk a little bit about the progression during the quarter I mean we're hearing you know that December was especially tough for some equipment companies. But did you see a drastic reduction in orders at the end of the quarter versus you know compared to the beginning of the quarter?
Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, no. In short, no.
Unidentified Company Representative : Pretty short.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Okay, and then another topic that always comes up is new hospital construction. What are you seeing there? You know how does that impact you? Some of these projects that are being delayed you know at least on the breaking ground when would that start to impact your business?
Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, I mean you're reading and hearing the same thing as we're reading and hearing. There are places that are slowing down. But again that I mean a hospital construction period can depending on when you start it, the planning phase, the break ground phase, all that can take a couple, three years.  So you know that largely depends on what happens the next 12 months or so because there are clearly things still in the pipeline coming. The question is you know when do they start, when do they stop, and you know we don’t know the answer to that question, obviously. 
Daniel Owczarksi – Avondale Partners: Okay, and then you started talking a little bit about the strength in the surgery business or the surgical products. You know is that can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there as far as is it new projects or new products driving that strength? Is it that integrated OR? Do you think you're taking share? I mean is it new customers that you're gaining?
Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, I mean I would characterize it more in terms of the success of the new products. The LED light has been very strong, the OR integration unit is strong. And, of course, OR integration we just entered the business a while back so I mean we're taking share by definition. We have some you know I wouldn’t characterize it such as a share gain it's just that we've entered that business.  So those two areas have been very strong for us in the OR. And that's, I think, the biggest driver. 
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Okay and then just switching to isomedics it looks like there is some nice growth there despite you know hospital admissions being down, elective surgeries being down, do you expect that to continue or would that react to you know some of this downturn?
Unidentified Company Representative : You know, Dan, the real question there is how much of a downturn are hospitals going to have and particularly various types of surgeries. It just so happens that our supply chain has continued to drive that product through.  So you know yes some of the products we do are, I think, more resistant than others to you know we're not doing a whole lot of facial plastic surgery devices. So some of the things we're doing are just more resistant I think. In the long run if hospitals or patients reduce their usage obviously we would reduce along with it. 
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners: Okay, and then this last question may be for Mike about the CapEx number. Is that down from the what you said on the last call? And are there projects that you're pushing off?
Mike Tokich :  Yes it’s down from our last call, right now we’re anticipating approximately $40 million and like everybody else we are challenging our own operators to see if they can do without certain capitol equipment expenditures and well most of our equipment other than the life sciences or sorry isomedics we you know lower the cobalt which is the larger pieces which help with sterilization process. Most other of that is just normal maintenance and we’ve been able to challenge the operators to delay some of their maintenance and repairs without impacting the business.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners :  Okay, thank you. 
Operator:  Mr. Halter from Great Lakes Review you may ask your question.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Yes, good morning.
Julie Winter:  Hi Greg.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative:  I know you had mentioned in the release about raw material costs being higher in the fourth quarter and just wondering if you could elaborate on that aspect of the business in particular which areas may be a challenge and then whether or not you expect to see any relief as time passes given general lower raw material costs?
Unidentified Company Representative:  Yes I’d say there is two things there I'll contrast. First of all, a number of our materials are oil based derived and if you can forecast the price of oil these days you’re better than us, so you know we’ve had a little bit of a conservative forecast there probably. There’s another set which are used in our chemistries and they’re still – the price has still not seen relief, let’s put it that way. Particularly potassium and melithium (ph) have not seen real relief. Where we have seen relief it’s already baked in is stainless steel, you remember last year we had very high stainless steel and stainless has come down significantly and we’ve seen the impact of that. So you know the fourth quarter comment was really about those the oil based materials, as well as, the chemistry or the chemicals for chemistry.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative:  Okay, that is very helpful and relative to the competitive environment I just wondered if you could provide any commentary on what you’re seeing with any new entrance or exiting entrance doing anything new or different?
Unidentified Company Representative:  No I can’t say there’s any significant new thing out there.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative:  Okay and anything new to report on the DOJ investigation?
Unidentified Company Representative:  Well same old same old we continue to work on this regulatory issue used and when we have something to report you’ll be the first to hear.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative:  Okay, I’ll be waiting by my phone. All right also in non-interest expense was I think $2 million or so over $2 million, it seems higher than maybe it should have been anything in there unusual?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, it’s suppose to have the impact of our $150 million private placement that we conducted and closed in August so this quarter is a little bit higher than the previous quarters because of that.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative :  Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative:  So nothing more than that.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative:  All right and on your cash balance of $106 million or so, well what country or countries is that invested in and what is it invested in?
Mike Tokich:  Mortgaged bonds, I didn’t even get a chuckle? 
Walter Rosebrough:  You go ahead Mike, sorry.
Mike Tokich:  Most of that investment, the majority is invested in U.S. and the majority is you know Treasuries, T-bills of the like. You know very short term focused as everybody else is incurring very short interest small interest not much where we're gaining from that so it’s really just very secure from our standpoint and very you know 60, 30, 60, 90 days investments no further than that.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative:  So a great safety but not a whole lot of return currently.
Unidentified Company Representative:  Exactly right, yes.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative : Okay and what’s the average rate on your debt currently? 
Unidentified Company Representative:  It's around 6%.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative:  Okay and one last one, I know you bought stock in the quarter of a million shares, just wondered what your outlook is looking forward in regards to that program?
Unidentified Company Representative:  You know we have about 200 million remaining in the authorization and we never forecast what we are or not going to do, we are opportunistic in that regard.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative:  I would presume with the stock under 30 that would be more opportunistic than not given that it’s less than what you paid before.
Unidentified Company Representative:  That’s a good assumption but the counter assumption is cash is pretty keen right now and we’re balancing those two issues.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Representative:  Okay great thank you.
Operator:  Mr. Zable from Natixis you may ask your question.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  Hey guys thanks for taking my follow-up here. Just a couple of kind of housekeeping items again just on the P&L, it seems like you’ve kind of gotten your R&D expense stable, sort of on an absolute basis seems like it’s between 8 and 9 million. Is that sort of the right way to think about it or you know I know you guys have talked about new product development and things like that, is that just a function of you guys kind of just tightening the belt here given the environment and you know maybe next year or just going forward it may come up on an absolute basis?
Unidentified Company Representative:  You know Josh we haven’t finalized our next year’s budget for R&D. You know we look at it on a project by project basis and you know what we have in the pipeline, what we want to do, what new things we’re going to look at and so it’s not really done on a dollar basis or percentage basis. It will vary somewhat. It can be lumpy because of the timing of the projects things can come together but as a general statement you know if you think about that kind of on a percentage of revenue you're probably not too far out the ballpark.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  Okay that’s helpful and then I know you got some more cost cutting coming here. Can you just kind of – is it all going to be SG&A or is it going to be you know COGS as well?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well definitely a mixture.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  Definitely a mixture and then again on the SG&A line not to pin you guys here and I know you’re given guidance, I mean you guys continue to come down really as a percentage of sales, and I’m just trying to understand Sir, what’s the real way to think about it here? Is it really just thinking about sort of – have you kind of hit everything and now it’s whatever you do more or is there still room to come down on a percentage of sales?
Unidentified Company Representative:  You know Josh I’ve tried to characterized our efforts here as we’re not on a crash diet and then go back to eating merrily, that we’re trying to change our eating habits. So I in no way view that we have finished improvements or efficiency in this business in any of the areas. So I fully expect we will continue now, of course, we’ve talked about things that we’ve already declared things that we know we’re doing the results of the latest round, for example, I think is 10 or 12 million in next year. We still have some things floating through from previous work we’ve done so those things we have been clear on. We haven’t done our forecast for next year, but we certainly do not and particular in this environment, we think we would be remiss to not continue to look for every opportunity to reduce costs that doesn’t hurt our customers or our products.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  Okay and then I guess sort of related to that given environment I know you said you know life sciences you guys have been talking about for awhile as far as you know not paying for revenues and I think that makes a ton of sense. But even on the health care side was there kind of a tightening of the belt this quarter just as a precautionary matter or is this just kind of you're doing business obviously conservatively I know you said that and you know you’ll keep to look cutting costs?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, Josh, without question two answers, the first answer is yes we continue to work conservatively, you know we continue to look for ways to find ways to get things done at a less expensive path. So we’re going to continue – I mean I try to think of it less in terms of cost cutting, more in terms of improving efficiencies and so we’re always looking for a more efficient ways to do things.  But secondly you know it’s pretty obvious things were changing out there the last quarter or so and so we took several actions to make sure our costs not only didn’t grow but shrunk and that’s why you’re seeing a combination of both those things. They will pull through the balance of this year and continue into next.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  Okay and then just one last one here guys sorry, just in terms of the sales on the health care business you know again be strong with the new products on the surgical side, can you A just sort of give out a kind of timeline just remind me in terms of both V-Pro and the new surgical suite products when you sort of anniversary them when they were launched?  And B can you just help me understand sort of how these orders came about. Obviously not one by one but were these you know built outs that you were completing it’s pretty impressive given the environment out there that you guys are selling anything let alone you know lights and surgical suites. And I’m trying to understand you know sort of even the hospital's mentality of sort of where they’re prioritizing and kind of how your sales came to fruition. If you can give me just a little color I know that’s kind of a wide question but just a little bit more color there.
Unidentified Company Representative :  Let me break into three general comments I think, Josh. The first is we have seen a significant increase in our business in large projects and you know there just are still significant projects in the pipeline and there have been and are and we’ve done a nice job of gathering some of those projects up.  Largely as a result of these new products and so coming back the LED light was early this year. Kind of time frames when it really started hitting its stride. So kind of the back half of the year or maybe even back two-thirds of the year is the LED light. The integration, OR integration really kind of just getting going I mean it's been – we had it in the market for a while but it really just in the back half of the year I would say kind of right on shipment basis not on order basis. The V-PRO is really just this quarter hitting any significant numbers. And we would hope to see that continue to improve. We’ve just announced a new washer or just released a new washer in the market place. It’s just now starting so (inaudible) list is probably six months or so that we’ve had good you know good real volume. So I mean that’s, I think, a big part of the explanation to why we’ve been able to continue to do well – the products are really just hitting their stride. Now it doesn’t make a difference what products you have if people quit buying everything but you know when hospitals aren’t stopping buying everything. They’re just reducing and actually not all of them are reducing. So from what they’re saying out there. And now coming to the second part of the question and I mentioned this in our last call, relatively speaking you know it’s all relative. But relatively speaking the OR Suite is where hospitals generate revenue and income and so you know all things being equal I think the OR Suite is kind of a nice place to be in capital equipment, relatively speaking. And we’re seeing that, we thought that I’ll call it theoretically but that seems to be playing out at least for our business as we speak and then, of course, we have some new products in that area which helps it even more.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder :  And then one other thing. I know you said you guys did not see really much change over the progression of the quarter. Obviously I know somebody else alluded to the fact that you know December was pretty rough across the board and that’s you know coinciding with both the economy and the holidays. Just anecdotally I mean have you guys seen any change in behavior. I know you didn’t see too much of a difference over the course of last quarter but here we are in January. I’m sort of hearing things are improving. Can you give us any color of what you’re seeing or since seeing that you didn’t really see much change over the quarter you haven’t seen much change in January?
Unidentified Company Representative :  Well I mean as we said we clearly thought in the quarter we clearly saw softening. I mean our growth rates slowed quite clearly. I don’t know that we temporally saw a whole lot during the quarter and certainly the month December I would say we didn’t see you know that much significance.  I mean October, November, December clearly were slower growth rates than the prior quarter and I don’t know that January is looking a whole lot different you know as a matter of general principle. But again you have to remember you know some of our business is consumables and consumables ride pretty much with a little lag but ride pretty much with hospital admissions, if you will, and so if you kind of watch hospital admissions you have some feel for that. On the capital side it could be lumpy so I can think you know two weeks ago I could think the world’s coming to an end and then I get four big orders and I think everything’s glory. I tend to be careful about looking week to week during a month and trying to make a forecast out of it.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder :  That’s very fair. Thanks so much for taking all my questions guys and really congrats on a superb quarter here.
Unidentified Company Representative :  Thanks, Josh.
Operator:  Mr. Ramgopal from Sidoti, you may ask your question.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti:  Yes, hi. Good morning guys, just a couple of questions. Just to understand the guidance with regards to the operating margin of 12.5% for the year, is that going on the $.048 quarter or if you exclude the restructuring et cetera if it's $0.03?
Unidentified Company Representative: It's actually going off the as reported the $0.48 quarter. 
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Okay. And with regards to restructuring charges and et cetera it is fair to assume that we'll probably see a few more of those until you know you're complete with the program. 
Unidentified Company Representative: Oh well there is some that is built in. You will see, we've reported the amounts. It was not all reflected in the third quarter so the answer to that is yes. 
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, for this particular plan if you will for the restructuring and the end of third quarter plan, we will see that continue with the minor expenses coming over the next couple of quarters associated with this action. 
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Okay. And again you know one of the things that I – you’ve been talking in this meeting to the good numbers we're seeing and new products. And again you probably can't get specific but as, you know, looking the pipeline of products you have in development et cetera, is it fair to assume that, you know, we should continue to see, you know, a pretty good rollouts of like what we saw with (inaudible) et cetera just products of sustained growth? 
Unidentified Company Representative: We don't expect the products to stop. You have to go – we don't give forecasts on new products. We release them but again the division one we just talked about its just now in the marketplace as an example and we do not expect our development to stop here. 
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Okay. Thanks again. 
Operator: (Operator instructions). Mr. Macosko from Lord Abbett you may ask your question. 
Greg Macosko - Lord Abbett: Yes. Thanks. Thank you. Yes. Just with regard to the previous question on new products roughly speaking, is there –do you have a goal with kind of how many to introduce over a year or a quarter or anything like that. As we look out over the next year, can we expect X number of introductions? 
Unidentified Company Representative: Well we know what we're going to do for the next 12 months and we – roughly what we're going to do for the next 12 months. We don't give numbers on that. So…
Greg Macosko - Lord Abbett: But would you expect to be kind of at the same rate we've been experiencing? Is that a fair statement? 
Unidentified Company Representative: You know actually – first of all, I don't know the math there exactly and secondly, I don’t think we'll want to be giving that forecast anyway. 
Greg Macosko - Lord Abbett: Okay. Back to the debt, just so I understand that, you said you had 150 million in private placement in August and you paid some off. Have you paid it all off and what was that? 
Unidentified Company Representative: We had our first private placement back in 2003. And we had the first amount on that private placement which was $40 million which came to maturity and was repaid. So now we have $60 million associated with the 2003 private placement and then we did another private placement in August of 2008 for $150 million. 
Greg Macosko - Lord Abbett: Okay. 
Unidentified Company Representative:  So they're two separate charges. 
Greg Macosko - Lord Abbett: And the $60 million is due when? 
Unidentified Company Representative: We don't have another payment until 2013. 
Greg Macosko - Lord Abbett: On that 60? 
Unidentified Company Representative: On that first – on both of the private placements combined. 
Greg Macosko - Lord Abbett: Okay. Okay. Good. Okay. And with regard to – you said there was a significant increase in large project business. I'm assuming that’s hospital, surgery centers, surgery suites et cetera being designed and put in. And that, I would assume, has been in your backlog perhaps for a longer, over a longer period than some of the other projects. If we out in the backlog in the healthcare area and the equipment area, how much further out can we look in terms of those large projects? Are there many more of them left in the backlog? 
Unidentified Company Representative: There are. The phenomenon I've described of these large projects has been throughout this year and in our current backlog it would be a similar phenomenon. 
Greg Macosko - Lord Abbett: So you expect this to go on for a little while? 
Unidentified Company Representative: You know that will be interesting to watch I mean again the hospitals, they have certain projects you know if you’ve already put the steel up and you're you know building out the rooms unless you really crash them down, you want to fill them. So we do expect to see it. The question is order of magnitude. 
Greg Macosko - Lord Abbett: With regard to the change in benefit policy, am I right in interpreting that this was basically a way of recognizing it and that if we look over on a year-to-year basis that it really doesn't change very much. 
Unidentified Company Representative:  That's a very good statement. First of all you know we didn't do this for finance class accounting reasons. We did it for operational reasons and it does a number of things. It gives our people more flexibility to take pay versus time. It rewards those who come to work. It reduces unplanned absenteeism which really helps increase our productivity in our factories.  It does a number of things like that, as well as, streamlining administration. And so as we were doing that we looked at the positives for our people and for the business and as we were doing that we accrue this pay-time off over the course of the year.  So you know over the next 30 years we'll see that $7 million probably come to place. But it you know it is just a how one accounts for it question. So you've asked the question very well. 
Greg Marcosko – Lord Abbett: Thank you and then with regard to I think it's isomedics of all your businesses am I right in saying that would have the most commercial or non-medical part of your sales?
Unidentified Company Representative:  Well in a way yes because they have some but its diminimus. You know everything else is kind of 100% life science or healthcare related but I don’t know the exact percentage but we're taking in the 90% plus range that is healthcare devices type of thing. So we would consider it a life science company, as well. People are sterilizing orthopedic implants and band-aids and things like that so it is health.
Greg Marcosko – Lord Abbett: Okay but so with regard to your sales in general this sterilization that is exposed to non-healthcare is pretty small?
Unidentified Company Representative:  Trivial. 
Greg Marcosko – Lord Abbett: Trivial, okay that's a better way – you can even –
Unidentified Company Representative:  It was trivial. We will not notice. 
Greg Marcosko – Lord Abbett: Okay. And all right very good. I appreciate that, thank you. 
Unidentified Company Representative:  Great, thanks. 
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back for any closing remarks.

Walter Rosebrough:  Thanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone. And thank you all for joining us again this morning. I will focus on the highlights of the quarter and will then turn the call over to Mike to review our financial performance in more detail. We started this fiscal year with a good first quarter and I'm pleased that the people of STERIS have delivered a second strong quarter. All three of our segments delivered solid growth and the cost reduction activities we have put in place helped drive continued improvement in earnings. Now, when you look at our performance this quarter, and for the first half of the year, I need to remind you that we implemented a few changes at the beginning of this fiscal year in an effort to level out our production and reduce the historic seasonality in our business. As a result, we expect our performance will be more evenly distributed throughout this year when compared to prior years. This is causing a timing of our comparisons with last year to look a little bit strong in the first half and will continue to have implications for growth rates in the second half of the year although in the opposite direction. Taking a minute to review our segment performance, Healthcare delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, driven in part by new products as well as growth in large project orders. Backlog and orders have both continued to grow, giving us confidence in our near-term performance. We've not yet felt any significant pinch from the broader economic issues facing the general markets but we are spending time talking with our customers to better understand the potential impact on their spending in the coming months. We have seen some delay of projects in international businesses, where local currencies have weakened significantly in the past few weeks. Our Life Science segment grew faster than we had anticipated which we believe is largely timing. The year-over-year comparison is also strong since we had a weak second quarter last year in that segment. Much to their credit, the Life Science team continues to manage expenses to improve profitability, even in the face of a continued slowdown in the North American pharmaceutical market. Last, but not least, our Isomedix segment had another solid quarter. As you saw in our press release, we sold a Chicago area ethylene oxide facility to one of our customers during the quarter, which added to the segment's profitability. This was nearly a captive plant for one customer and the transaction benefited both us and our customer. It is consistent with our strategy to optimize existing facilities and invest in additional capacity where we have growth opportunity. For the full year, we anticipate that the gain on the sale will approximately offset lost profits from the facility. Based on our year-to-date performance, for the total company, we are adjusting our outlook for the full year. We now anticipate that revenue will be on the high-end of our previously communicated range of 4% to 6%, reflecting a stronger year for our Healthcare segment than we had originally thought. We don't believe we will maintain double-digit growth levels, but are comfortable with high single digit growth for the segment for the full year. Our expectations for Life Science are unchanged. While we now anticipate Isomedix growth will be in the low single digits due to the facility sale I mentioned earlier. On the bottom-line we currently anticipate our earnings per diluted share to exceed the high-end of our previous range by as much as $0.15 or up to $1.80. As you know, we are making a number of assumptions in these estimates, including a modest increase in material costs and slight weakening of the US dollar. I will now hand over the call to Mike Tokich who will review the numbers in more detail. Michael?
Michael Tokich:  Thank you, Walt. Good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to discuss our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Let me begin with an overview of the income statement. Second quarter revenue increased 10%, reflecting growth in all reportable business segments. Organic growth for the quarter was 9% with 7% from volume and 2% from pricing. Foreign currency translation contributed 1%. Gross margin in the quarter was 41%, an increase of 30 basis points compared with the second quarter of last year. The improvement in gross margin reflects pricing and productivity improvements, partially offset by increases in raw materials and freight, plus an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. As a percentage of revenue, earnings before interest and taxes were 14.5% in the second quarter, an increase of 550 basis points compared with the prior year period. The improvement reflects higher gross margin attainment, improved operating expense leverage, and the gain on the sale of our Isomedix facility. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 36%, compared with 37.4% in the prior year quarter. Net income was $28.8 million or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with net income of $16 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. During the quarter, EPS was favorably impacted by $0.02 from the gain on sale of our Isomedix facility. Moving on to our reportable segments, Healthcare revenue increased 10% in the quarter, driven by growth in capital equipment revenues of 14%, as we continue to benefit from our new product offerings and orders for large projects. The remainder of the Healthcare business also performed well, with both service and consumable revenue growing 7%. Demand trends continue to be strong with record backlog levels of $124 million at the end of the second quarter. The Healthcare segment revenue grew nicely on a global basis with 9% growth in the U.S. and 13% growth internationally during the quarter. The Healthcare segment operating margin rate was 14.4% compared with 10.4% in the same quarter last year. The improvement in operating margin rate was driven by increased volumes, higher gross margins and improved operating expense leverage. Life Sciences revenue grew 9% compared with the prior year, driven by 17% growth in capital equipment revenues, primarily due to the timing of shipments and a weak second quarter last year. While we did have pockets of strength within the segment, we continue to experience an anticipated slowdown in spending from our North American pharmaceutical customers. We do not anticipate sustaining this capital equipment growth rate during the second half of the year. Also contributing to the quarter for Life Sciences, consumable revenue grew 8% and service revenue grew 2%. Backlog levels for Life Sciences declined 16% to $49 million in the quarter as compared with the same period last year. For the second quarter, Life Sciences revenue grew 2% in the United States and 23% internationally. Life Sciences operating margin rate was 10.9% compared with 6.4% in the same quarter last year. The improvement in operating margin rate was driven by increased volumes and lower operating expense levels. Isomedix Services revenue grew 6% driven by increased demand from medical device customers and modest increase in price. Isomedix reported an operating margin rate of 27.6% compared with 20.4% in the prior year period. During the quarter, Isomedix sold a facility to a privately held customer, which added $2.1 million to the segment's profitability. Turning to the balance sheet, our DSO level was 58 days, an improvement of five days as compared with the second quarter of last year. Total inventory at quarter-end was $161.3 million compared with $157.7 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.3 million, and depreciation and amortization were $14.4 million. The first half of fiscal 2009 was another strong period of cash generation. Free cash flow in the first half of this year was $57.3 million compared with free cash flow of $31.6 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement in cash flow largely reflects the increase in earnings and the Isomedix sale which added $9.5 million to free cash flow. Given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow position along with our low net debt to total capital ratio of 10.8%, we continue to be active with our share repurchase program. Since the beginning of this fiscal year, we have repurchased 1,986,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $30.99. Approximately $217 million remains under our current share repurchase authorization. As previously announced during the quarter, we completed a private placement of $150 million in long-term debt with maturities ranging from 5 years to 12 years. Approximately half of those proceeds were used to pay down our existing credit facility. By completing this transaction, we were able to lock in favorable long-term rates. This concludes my review of the second quarter results. I will now turn things back over to Julie to begin the Q&A portion of our call. Julie?
Julie Winter: Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. We're now ready to begin the Q&A session. Angela, will you please give the instructions and we'll begin.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Daniel Owczarski with Avondale Partners. Your line is open.
Julie Winter: Dan?
Walt Rosebrough:  Sounds like we may have a technical glitch, operator.
Operator: One moment, please. It looks like we have a question from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open, sir.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Hello. I am on if you can hear me.
Walt Rosebrough:  Good morning, Greg.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Good morning. Let me see, where should I start here? Regarding Isomedix facility, when was that sold during the quarter? I guess why was it sold?
Walt Rosebrough:  The transaction date was September 29th. So it was near the – actually at the end of the second quarter.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. And you mentioned the gain of I think $2.1 million in operating income as a benefit to the segment. Is that included in the overall income statement in SG&A or cost of goods sold or elsewhere?
Michael Tokich:  It is actually as part of SG&A. It's a $2.1 million was recorded as a benefit that offset SG&A expenses for the quarter.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. And your share count from quarter-to-quarter I think increased by about 800,000 shares, yet you bought about a million shares through October 29. Just wondered if you could provide some comment on why the share count went up and where you stand currently on the share count.
Michael Tokich:  We actually have seen a slight increase basically because of the number of options being exercised at the higher level prices of approximately $37, $38 during the quarter.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay.
Michael Tokich:  Right now, we stand roughly about 60 million shares outstanding from a diluted standpoint.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  And that includes the buyback through October 29?
Michael Tokich:  Correct.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. And I know you made some comments about the dollar with strength being beneficial to the company. How much assistance did that provide in the quarter and how much would you expect going forward if we stay at around 130 on the euro?
Michael Tokich:  For the quarter, FX helped our revenue growth by approximately $2 million. And actually from an operating income standpoint, we had a slight positive impact of approximately $600,000. But if you look at the full year – if you look at the first half, our revenues were favorably impacted by $5.9 million, but we did see negative operating income impact of $2.5 million. So even though the dollar did strengthen in the second quarter, it was not enough to offset the weakness in the first quarter.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. And your – I know you did the private placement and your cash went up from I think $49 million to $160 million. Obviously, your debt increased as well from about $178 million to $250 million on a sequential basis. Is the differential there just the free cash flow as well as the – I guess some of that is from the Isomedix facility sale?
Michael Tokich:  That is correct, Greg. Yes.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. And do you have any short-term debt currently?
Michael Tokich:  We have approximately $800,000 of short-term debt.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Minimal. Alright. That's all for now. Thanks.
Michael Tokich:  Thanks, Greg.
Operator: And it looks like our next question comes from Joshua Zable with Natixis Bleichroeder. Your line is open.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Can you hear me?
Julie Winter:  Yes.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Great. Congratulations on another great quarter here, guys. Great work.
Julie Winter:  Thanks, Josh.
Walt Rosebrough:  Thanks, Josh.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Couple of questions. First of all, as far as the general hospital spending goes, obviously, the backlog is at record levels. I know you guys have been very clear about – the growth looks strong in the beginning half of the year and it may look appear weaker just on a comparable basis. But can you just talk about – we've heard from a number of companies, hospital spending or hospitals are delaying purchases at least in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can talk about what you're seeing specifically, if anything's changed in October. Maybe why, if you're not seeing anything, what gives you the confidence that you're not going to or to the extent that what makes you guys different. I know it's a lot of questions in one, but –
Walt Rosebrough:  Joshua, I guess – I would start by saying what makes us different is we were probably little more cautious starting out. We said from the beginning that we were concerned about our – what was going to happen with the elections and everything. So I would say our general forecast was probably a little cautious relative to the average bear. And so that would be for the first statement. The second statement is we generally have not seen weakness to-date in our order patterns or we're not seeing cancellations. The kind of things that would give you real pause. So we just have not seen that to-date. And so – since we have – we have no ability to forecast something we haven't seen. We're clearly talking to customers about those things and we're not hearing that that is – that's in their plans, in our business. Clearly, they have had some weakness in terms of their revenues and they're seeing margin squeezes in the hospital industry. And how that affects – of course, they're going to be more cautious I think going forward. We have not seen that. You also have to remember, we have two components of our business, a consumables piece and a capital piece. The consumables piece will follow more – I'll call it their general spending patterns. And so we may see I think a slower growth in that than we might have otherwise seen. But again I think we were little cautious going in. On the capital side, that tends to be people just making decisions right, slowing things or delaying things. We may see some delay, but we tend to be a little further out in time. So we may see some delay and we've been – again, we think we've been cautious about that, particularly comes to our Q4 which is the calendar Q1. As I mentioned, we have seen – really about the only thing we've seen to-date is some international orders where again, in the current where the currencies have weakened dramatically and they are pushing things off in time. We have not seen cancellations yet there either. By the way, there's always things pushing in and out in this business, and so you're looking for a differential of a differential. So far we have not seen that occurring.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Just when you say you're further out in time, is it a function of they place the order and you guys have to install it so it takes longer so once they're committed they're sort of committed that they can't pull out whereas, say, some other device that they could kind of bring in or bring out – as soon as they buy it. Is that why you're kind of different?
Walt Rosebrough:  If you're in the middle of a refurbishing of an operating room and that is one of your principal sources of revenue. Once you started it, it's gone, hard to stop. If they haven't started, that's a different question. But once you started, it's hard to stop. It is a revenue generating part of the system. So that could be an answer. The other side is, as you guys know, we have and we mentioned before, we have a number of new products on the market. And so it's difficult – if your new products are doing well which ours are, sometimes you're seeing gains in that new product offset by general loss. It's hard to figure out which of those two – as long as the net's positive, it's still positive. So that could be another explanation. But this point, we just have not seen reductions in those order rates.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Alright. That's great. Great to see.
Walt Rosebrough:  By the way, Josh, you know me, I am cautious about that. I am not telling you that we won't see it. I'm just saying we haven't seen it to-date.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Sure. No. I guess I am just we've heard a number of people say it and I don't want to beat the dead horse. It's just a question of is there maybe there was some rational explanation as to kind of something about your equipment. Obviously, if they need a new one, there is no getting around it. But as far as replacing, the pushback one would make is if an autoclave lasts 30 years, why do I need a new one today when I can buy it next year or two years or three years.
Walt Rosebrough:  That's absolutely correct. And again I would say some of it could be the longer duration project orientation, if you will. And those projects are continuing to come to completion. But the rest I cannot answer any more than those guys who are subject to completely just replacement. They're going to see it quicker, I would think.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Okay. And then just quickly on the Life Sciences, the backlog is down. Like you said, just a function of the pharmaceutical companies having issues out there that we all know about. Is that a safe way to think about it?
Walt Rosebrough:  I think that's a very safe way to think about it.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Cool.
Walt Rosebrough:  Again, it's largely the North American side, yes.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  SG&A, obviously lower. I know you got a benefit from the sale of Isomedix facility. Just as far as how do we think about your SG&A going forward? Was this just a really good cost cutting quarter or could we potentially see – is this sort of a new model way of running the company?
Walt Rosebrough:  We've said from the beginning that we did that the one-time cut a couple quarters ago. And we said we weren't just doing a one-time cut and go feast or famine, we're staying on a different diet. And we intend to stay on a different diet. So I would expect to see continued cost – what's right word? Relative cost improvements.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Okay. Great. And then just following up on the Isomedix, I think Greg asked, just to be clear, you guys sold the facility. From a growth perspective and again, I know you guys have been very clear about the second half of the year relative to comps being more challenging. But when I think about Isomedix having lost this facility, should we think about growth sort of slowing down there being affected by this in any way?
Walt Rosebrough:  Clearly – I'll call it there is a one-time – if you think of it as same store kind of analogy –
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Exactly.
Walt Rosebrough:  There is clearly a reduction because there is – that store is gone. And that cut – it's largely, by the way, that was largely one customer that was the predominant part of that business and they're gone. But there is – that business is always a business of customers who do some of their sterilization themselves and then put some of their sterilization out to us. Some customers do all their sterilization on an outsource basis. And this customer continues to work with us on an outsource basis in other facilities. It turns out that it was a good – it's a good deal for them and a good deal for us. We're continuing to expand. As you've seen, we've put capital into that business and we will continue to put capital into that business expanding facilities. And we want to get them expanded where the business is or actually the old Wayne Gretzky comment where the business is going. And that's what we're doing. We try to get long-term commitments with our customers when we do that. So I wouldn't suggest that it will reduce growth – on a same store basis, we would not suggest this is a growth reducer. And we fully expect growth next year because we're bringing other capacity online. But clearly, it drops growth a bit in that kind of a one-time down shift, if you will.
Michael Tokich:  Josh, we have reduced the outlook for Isomedix revenue growth from mid single digits to low single digits, just based upon the sale of that one facility.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Okay. That's what I figured. And then just a question relative to the outlook and I'll get off. You guys made comments about foreign exchange. I know you talked a little bit about that and material costs. None of us can predict where oil is going or where foreign currency is going. We would rather we probably be sitting at a computer at home, trading, but that being said, I guess I'm trying to understand as far as you're looking at – the dollar has strengthened. So as we go forward the year, just to be clear on your language, you're assuming the dollar will effectively weaken from here out or you're assuming the dollar is flat. And then on the – I guess that's the first part. Material cost, I know there is sort of a lag effect. In other words, when you buy something it takes a little bit while to get through to the COGS. So obviously your materials that you bought a while ago are probably more expensive than the ones you're buying now so that will obviously hurt gross margin sort of – or in the way we think about it. That's still flowing through. But are you suggesting that you expect the sort of volatility of the prices, the low prices now to come up? Or are you just sort of giving us the heads up that we shouldn't expect to see gross margin expansion immediately because there has to be a flow through? I don't know if those questions are clear.
Walt Rosebrough:  (inaudible) Josh, first of all, the flow through for us is relatively quick in weeks and months, not months and years. So it doesn't take a year for the flow through to occur. That's point one. And as a general statement, we have some that is slightly different, but as a general statement that's true. Secondly, clearly in the last 30 days, we've seen a weakening of many of our material component costs. Stainless steel has continued to stay even to weaken. Steel is starting to soften a little bit. Oil clearly has softened significantly. On the other hand, we do have some chemistry that require the same chemicals that farm products do and those are definitely not weakening. In fact, they've gone up significantly. We had contracts in place, those contracts ended so some of those have gone up. So we still have a mixed bag of material. But the bigger issue is, just as you say, it's getting more and more difficult for anyone to forecast material costs these days. We're seeing some pretty wide swings in some pretty short-time periods. As a general statement, our forecasts are where our materials outlook was toward the end of this quarter. And as a general statement, our foreign exchange was where our outlook was toward the end of this quarter. The dollar has strengthened a little bit since then so our outlook has that historic 30 days ago kind of look. But – if it stays kind of where it is, it's not significantly material. But if it moves up 10% or 15% or down 10% or 15%, we're going to move with it.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  So I guess it's safe to say it's an issue of given the volatility to an extent you're building in some conservatism in terms of the dollar could weaken and other material prices that have come in could go up again. That's not unreasonable to expect, I'm just saying that's kind of the way you're playing it?
Walt Rosebrough:  That is exactly – we're not trying to give you a signal it takes four years for a cost to go through or four years for FX to go through. We're trying – we're just seeing there is a fair amount of volatility here and we'll travel with that volatility.
Joshua Zable – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Great. Thanks for taking all my questions, guys. Congrats again. Awesome job.
Walt Rosebrough:  Thank you, Josh.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And our next question comes from Daniel Owczarski with Avondale Partners. Your line is open.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners:  Can we try this again? Can you hear me?
Walt Rosebrough:  Yes, sir.
Julie Winter:  Hi, Dan.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners:  Hi, guys. Congratulations.
Julie Winter:  Thanks.
Walt Rosebrough:  Thank you.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners:  Walt, you had mentioned large project orders being a little bit of a dragger for the quarter. Is there any way to quantify how that compared to last year and what is driving large project orders?
Walt Rosebrough:  Dan, I don't know – I don't have those numbers off the top of my head, but we have seen in the last year an increase in the amount of our businesses coming through as a part of a large project or total package. And we think a lot of that's because we've improved our products in the class, if you will. So if you have a better table and a better light and you're doing things together, then it's easier to drive a complete project as opposed to a piece. And secondly, there have been a lot of – I'll call it building and/or refurbishment of large projects out there so they're coming in, in bigger clumps. And we’ve obviously worked to do a better job on those large projects. So I would put those two factors together.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners:  Okay. And then on capital equipment sales, I think we've asked you in the past whether these can be like leading indicators for consumables and services down the road. Is that the case or is a good chunk of this capital equipment more like lighting where they're one-time in nature?
Walt Rosebrough:  Yes, I don't view capital and consumables necessarily being leading or lagging indicators to each other. Consumables obviously travel more directly with – I'll call it basic hospital demand. So either admissions and patient days type things or surgical procedures, depending of what type of consumable it is. And so those kind of travel with general demand. Capital is far more dependent on what their capital spending decisions are. I will say it's a lot – capital tends to be a little more volatile as a general statement than consumables for that reason. Because it's decision-based as opposed to kind of routine operation based.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners:  Okay. Just last question, going to the Isomedix warning letter. Is that specific to the Rhode Island facility those issues that came up? Or are those same processes, procedures in that other Isomedix facilities and could they be exposed to warning letters as well?
Walt Rosebrough:  All of our facilities – Isomedix is one of the most highly regulated businesses that you can have because we're rated by the FDA, the EPA, the NRC Regulatory Commission, so the NRC. We have all kinds of regulations. They are routinely inspected by all of the above and so we are always subject to inspections. Having said that, the specific citing or the specific warning letter does relate only to that facility in Rhode Island. It's only subject to that facility in Rhode Island. And that warning letter in our view has no impact on our other facilities, per se. And we do have – we have generally similar processes in all those facilities, but they're all at different levels of automation and different levels of how they work in terms of – and by the way, and some are very different processes. Some of our facilities are ETO facilities. Others are radiation facilities. So there is a wide variation among – if you put all the facilities together. So I don't see this as being a – I'll call it systemic issue that this relates to. But clearly, we always want to take learnings we have from one facility and apply them to the others and we're doing that.
Daniel Owczarski – Avondale Partners:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And it looks like our next question comes from John Emrich with Ironworks Capital. Your line is open, sir.
John Emrich – Ironworks Capital:  Could you just repeat the answer to the question about what foreign exchange added to the top and bottom line in the quarter?
Michael Tokich:  Certainly. For the quarter, FX impact on revenues were about $2 million positive. And then on an operating income standpoint, they were approximately $600,000 positive for the quarter.
John Emrich – Ironworks Capital:  And it's just – I'm new to the story, it's just not intuitive to me for a U.S. company, I'm not sure. How does the sudden strengthening of the dollar help you? Has it – what is your set up that caused that?
Walt Rosebrough:  The cost side of the equation and we have a significant amount of our manufacturing facilities outside the U.S.
John Emrich – Ironworks Capital:  Got you.
Walt Rosebrough:  So the three currencies that we tend to look at are the Canadian dollar, the Peso and the Euro where we have manufacturing facilities outside the U.S.
John Emrich – Ironworks Capital:  And how does it help revenue?
Walt Rosebrough:  It doesn't – it can help revenue on sales outside the U.S.
John Emrich – Ironworks Capital:  Okay. Great. Thanks.
Walt Rosebrough:  It's strictly a mathematical equation.
John Emrich – Ironworks Capital:  Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal from Sidoti. Your line is open.
Mitra Ramgopal – Sidoti:  Just few questions. First, you had really nice volume in the quarter. I don't know if you can give us a sense as to how much of that really came from new products?
Michael Tokich:  From a Healthcare standpoint, we actually saw about a third of our capital growth coming from new products. New products continue to be something that we are strengthening as we move forward. We are getting good customer reception for the new products that we continue to introduce.
Mitra Ramgopal – Sidoti:  Okay. And what's the pipeline for additional products as we look out over the next 12 months?
Michael Tokich:  We don't discuss our new product pipeline, but we have one.
Mitra Ramgopal – Sidoti:  Okay. That's fair. I believe you had mentioned on the expense reduction program, you're expecting to realize about 50% to 70% of that in fiscal '09. Is that pretty much the same or are you running ahead of that?
Walt Rosebrough:  I think we're pretty much on target.
Mitra Ramgopal – Sidoti:  And then on the guidance, I think you said the operating margin was going to be about 12.5% for the year. And if we look at the first half, seem like you were running pretty much at least this last quarter well ahead of that. Anything in particular that might lead to a slowdown in the second half, outside of, say, higher raw material costs?
Walt Rosebrough:  First of all, there were a number of unusual items in the first half. So if you back those out – for example, the $2 million of Isomedix. If you back those out, you get different numbers, obviously. So that's the first answer. And the second answer is we are being cautious on the revenue and cost side as we have described.
Mitra Ramgopal – Sidoti:  Okay. Thanks again.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open, sir.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Thanks for letting me back in. What were your recurring revenues, either consumable, services in the quarter, either percent or dollars?
Michael Tokich:  If you look at total, I can give you the breakout of the recurring revenues. If you look at service, service in total, grew 6.8% – sorry 6% and consumables grew 7.5%.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. And as a percentage of your total revenues?
Michael Tokich:  Do you have what the percentage of total revenues is for?
Walt Rosebrough:  We don't have the percent, we can give you the numbers.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  The numbers that would be fine.
Julie Winter:  $192 million, Greg.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. Great. And then what is international to the total in terms of revenues?
Walt Rosebrough:  International is approximately 24% for the quarter.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  And how does your profitability in international compare to the domestic business?
Walt Rosebrough:  Domestic would be slightly more profitable.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. Any comments on the DOJ or the other FDA issue with System 1?
Walt Rosebrough:  No. We continue to work through the process with the agency and there is really nothing new to report.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. I know you talked about new products and that's an area that seems to be ramping up nicely. Are there any products in particular that you can comment on that have been introduced that are doing especially well?
Walt Rosebrough:  We're very pleased with our LED lights. We are – cleaning chemistries, we had couple that are out there now and they're doing nicely. And we're beginning to see – it's still early in its life, but we're beginning to see good tracks on V-PRO.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. That's good to hear. And also, relative to the competitive environment, any significant changes from getting their Ecolab or any of the others that may be out there?
Walt Rosebrough:  I don't think that we've seen any significant change.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. And one last one, given your strong free cash flow, any thoughts on the merger and acquisition area, either in terms of selling other facilities or purchasing I guess?
Walt Rosebrough:  First of all, in terms of selling facilities, the selling or opening – I'll speak specifically to Isomedix, because I think that may be where the question is pointed. As I've said if it's – we will be opportunistic working with our customers on any individual facilities if it makes sense for them and us. And by the same token, we want to grow in areas that are – where we see good long-term business. But as a general statement, we're not looking to pedal facilities. As a general statement, we're not looking to sell off capacity, if you will. As a general statement, we're looking to grow capacity in that business.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay.
Walt Rosebrough:  And then in terms of acquisitions in general, we continue to look at our environment for acquisitions. I mentioned to several of you on different occasions that I tend to like – relatively speaking, I like things that are very close to what we're already doing, where we can apply something we know or gather something someone else knows or does better than we do and apply it to our current products and markets. And so that would clearly be an area of interest to us. We are continuing to look in the marketplace and we will announce if we see – we won't be announcing anything until we do something.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Okay. And I did lie. One last one. Your R&D was down on a sequential basis slightly on a year-over-year and I know it bounces around. But is there anything more to read into that and should it still be about 3% of sales for the year?
Walt Rosebrough:  We are not looking to reduce R&D in total in our business. In fact, if anything, on a percentage basis or percentage of our cost basis, we're looking to continue to either stay the same or grow, on a dollar basis, for sure.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review:  Sounds good and we'll see you in early November.
Walt Rosebrough:  Yes, sir.
Michael Tokich:  Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Gary Kelly [ph] with Ironworks Capital. Your line is open.
Gary Kelly – Ironworks Capital:  Thanks. Just a follow-up on earlier question about the improved operating expense. I'm looking specifically at the SG&A line. You guys showed some I guess very good cost controls. I think it's around 24% of sales. The guidance though kind of implies maybe back to prior levels. Was there a one-time item or some one-time items in SG&A in the quarter as well?
Walt Rosebrough:  You may have remembered on the Isomedix sale, we had about a $2 million gain. That gain is reflected as a contra.
Gary Kelly – Ironworks Capital:  That specifically – okay so that's in the SG&A line then.
Walt Rosebrough:  Yes, sir.
Gary Kelly – Ironworks Capital:  Okay. Thanks. And I guess the follow-up on CapEx, should we see that coming down over the next couple of years? I think you're done with the plant moves. I guess what should we kind of be looking at a sort of an ongoing maintenance level of CapEx? And how should I look at that going forward?
Michael Tokich:  If you look at CapEx over the last several years, we've actually ran anywhere from $50 million to $55 million, $60 million on an annualized basis. We are projecting about $55 million approximately for this year. Lot of that is really just maintenance capital and specifically maintenance capital for Isomedix facility as we continue to have Cobalt loads in order to continue our processing speed within those Cobalt Isomedix facilities. Normal maintenance associated with our plants from an operating standpoint.
Walt Rosebrough:  But I would do a follow on statement of those. First is, clearly we will invest in capital where it makes sense for us to grow. That's clearly in new product development areas as well as any facility expansion or capacity we need to do that. Having said that we want to be as fiscally prudent with capital as we expect to be with operating expenses. And so we will be very careful with that capital spending.
Gary Kelly – Ironworks Capital:  That sounds very fair. Just to follow up on that, where would you currently stand on capacity utilization?
Walt Rosebrough:  That is a – we have so many businesses in so many different plants. That's a difficult question to answer broadly. But I would say as a general statement, we're not in a high capacity constrained kind of issue in terms of do we need to build a new plant to do – relatively modest growth rates. The answer would be no.
Gary Kelly – Ironworks Capital:  Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Heidi Lawrence with George Weiss. Your line is open.
Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss:  Hi, guys. How are you doing?
Michael Tokich:  Good.
Walt Rosebrough:  How are you, Heidi?
Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss:  Good, thanks. Just going back to the SG&A. I'm sorry to keep asking in different ways. If your SG&A was down around $10 million sequentially, can you just give us how much of that was actually from the closing of the Isomedix?
Michael Tokich:  $2 million.
Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss:  It's $2 million. Okay. Great. And then so for the back half, we shouldn't be expecting that – clearly that's what your guidance suggests, that we shouldn't be expecting that kind of sequential drop-off, right?
Walt Rosebrough:  Correct.
Heidi Lawrence – George Weiss:  Okay. I think that's it. Thanks, guys.
Michael Tokich:  Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Hughes with Delaware Investments. Your line is open, sir.
Mike Hughes – Delaware Investments:  Good morning. Couple of questions. I think you said that new products on the Healthcare capital equipment side accounted for about a third of the revenue growth. Do you have a comparable number from a year ago? That's the first question. Second question, how is the plant in Mexico performing now? And should we see incremental margin expansion as that facility runs even more efficiently or is it kind of where it needs to be right now?
Michael Tokich:  From a number standpoint, I can tell you that we are in a much higher position from a growth standpoint with capital equipment than we were a year ago.
Walt Rosebrough:  In terms of product as a percent of sales.
Michael Tokich:  Right, yes. And then from Mexico standpoint, we have completed that transition back in the fourth quarter of our last fiscal year, fiscal year 2008. We are anticipating $10 million to $15 million of improvement year-over-year from last year and this year. And that basically is a lot of that, if not all of that is due to labor arbitrage in moving the facility from Erie, Pennsylvania to Monterrey, Mexico. So you'll continue to see the impact of that throughout this fiscal year.
Mike Hughes – Delaware Investments:  Okay.
Walt Rosebrough:  But having said that, all plants can improve all years. So I wouldn't expect – if the plant were still in the area, we would be expecting improvement in Erie. If the plant is in Mexico, we will be expecting improvements in Mexico. But not the step function that you have seen.
Mike Hughes – Delaware Investments:  Okay. Last question. The changes that were put in place to mute the seasonality, when exactly did you enact those changes? Was it this quarter or the prior quarter?
Walt Rosebrough:  We started working on it eight, nine months ago. And so – and that is largely efforts toward both our sales force and then the way we manage – that we manage shipments. We're working to make sure that we first meet customer demand, second, work to level that operation flow as best we can, and third, of course, we are working to meet our targets. So I think we've kind of reversed that order a little bit to be more sensitive to customer demand first, more sensitive to try to keep level loading in our plants better, second. And we started that work, I would say eight, nine months ago, maybe even a year ago. And certainly – and that will be ongoing work. That's not simple to do. In a perfect world as you grow 10%, you would see a nice 10% ramp up over the course of the year. Never quite works out that way, but the closer you can get to that, the better your operations run.
Mike Hughes – Delaware Investments:  When did you – I assume you made changes to the comp plan for the sales force. When were those instituted? Was it the June quarter or September quarter?
Walt Rosebrough:  The first of this year.
Mike Hughes – Delaware Investments:  Alright. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wam [ph] FAF Advisors. You may ask your question, sir.
Andrew Wam – FAF Advisors: Good morning, gentlemen. Great quarter. Going back to the margin question, everybody keeps asking about SG&A. Even after you make the adjustment, it's still – I think it moves it up about 50 basis points to 24.6%. So is the margin that people are concerned about here in the second half? Should we really be thinking more about gross margin – or the cost of goods increasing dramatically in the second half versus the first half? And that's going to cause the changes in the operating margin? Or is there SG&A expense beyond the $2 million that you've already indicated because 24.5% versus first quarter of 28%, I'm not quite sure how we should be modeling the SG&A expense on the second half. And it sounds like on the R&D side, 2.5% to 3% in the second half is a reasonable level.
Michael Tokich:  Yes, I think you got to look at both gross margin and SG&A. An SG&A standpoint, not only did we have the $2.1 million favorable impact from the gain on the sale in the first half for SG&A. Your second point was right on. R&D, we are anticipating is going to increase at a much higher rate in the second half. So you have some timing differences. And then with gross margin standpoint, we are anticipating that we're going to have higher raw material costs in addition – from what we've seen in the first half. So it's a combination of all three of those is how I would try and model that.
Andrew Wam – FAF Advisors: Did you guys have or did you give – I want to say last quarter, did you guys give gross margin improvement for the full year – or am I not recalling correctly?
Michael Tokich:  We did. In our original guidance, we did give gross margin improvement for the full year.
Andrew Wam – FAF Advisors: Was that about 100 basis points year-over-year or – ?
Michael Tokich:  It was actually slightly more than that, but that guidance was based on a different way of how we view the business currently. We have made and we will make changes throughout the year, classification changes, that will affect cost shifting from Op expense to cost of goods sold. You will notice that over the course of the year. But if you look strictly on an operating margin rate, that is where we're focused on.
Andrew Wam – FAF Advisors: So should we really be thinking about the gross margin being around 41% in the second half?
Michael Tokich:  There actually be slightly less than that, based upon increased raw material costs.
Andrew Wam – FAF Advisors: Okay.
Michael Tokich:  But I would focus on the operating margin at approximately 12.5%.
Andrew Wam – FAF Advisors: Got it. Alright. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.
Michael Tokich:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator: I see no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back for closing remarks.

Analysts: Joshua Zable - Natixis Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partner Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments
Operator: Welcome to the Steris fiscal 2008 fourth quarter conference call. (Operator Instructions). I'd now like to introduce today's host, Mr. Aidan Gormley. Sir you may begin.
Aidan Gormley: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter and yearend conference call. Thanks for taking the time to join us this morning. Just for your reference, the announcement went out this morning via PR Newswire. And if you did not get a copy, you can get it at steris-ir.com. Joining me this morning are Walt Rosebrough, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Tokich, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

So with that introduction, I would like to hand the call over to Walt who will comment on the quarter and the year. Walt?
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Aidan, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank all of you who are with us today. I will very briefly reflect on the quarter and then comment on the year, then Mike Tokich will discuss the financials with you in more depth. I will return after that to discuss our outlook for fiscal 2009 and our general areas of focus going forward. First of all, I am very pleased that we were able to deliver 26% earnings growth in the quarter over a very strong 2007 Q4 despite the inflationary pressures and weaker dollar. Our demand continues to be solid overall. But perhaps most important, we were able to generate strong shipments out of our new Monterrey facility. Although we expected them to improve, even we were pleasantly surprised that they were able to deliver a 40% increase in shipments compared to the third quarter. This is just tremendous performance and it gives us great confidence that operations at the facility had now stabilized and we can put the ramp-up behind us. A lot of hard work went into that work and I thank our folks in Monterrey for their efforts and for their dedication. With that transition now complete we can meet customer demand on a sustained basis and will reap the full benefits we expected from the move going forward. Now let me reflect on the year. Fiscal 2008 was in many ways a transition year for the company. It was transitional not only in terms of leadership changes with me joining, Tim Chapman assigned to head our Healthcare segment, John Voyzey to lead Life Science, and Mike Tokich stepping up as CFO, but also in the actions that were taken to drive sustainable future results. As we've discussed, a major undertaking of the year was completing the transfer of sterilizer manufacturing to a new and more efficient facility in Mexico, but we also introduced several new products and continue development work on a range of others. In addition, we began the journey of reducing our operating cost as a percent of revenue, particularly though that are not directly attributable to developing, building, selling and servicing products. Although some of these cost reduction resulted in a one-time restructuring charge that Mike will discuss later, I have told our people that these are not one-time or temporary reductions. We've not gone on a one-time crash diet, but are changing our eating habits forever. Overall, revenues increased 6% for the year to an all-time high of $1.27 billion. Healthcare grew 5%, Life Science 9%, and Isomedix 5%. Although we got a bit behind in earnings earlier in the year largely due to significant increases in raw materials and foreign exchange, as well as the slower than anticipated ramp up in Monterrey, we were able to come back strong in the fourth quarter to post record earnings per share for the year excluding charges. Regarding the foreign exchange issue, we do have some natural hedge between the US and Europe because we manufacture some products in the US through export and sell products in Europe. But as we moved more of our production capacity outside of United States, a broad based weakening of the dollar versus other currencies does put pressure on our cost in dollars. In addition, the weaker dollar contributes to raw material cost increases. In 2008 we deliberately made additional investment and will continue to make investment in product development and in new product launch initiatives. Although these investments dampen near-time earnings, they are the lifeblood of a healthcare technology company. We must and will continue to develop proprietary products that encourage our customer to turn to Steris. This past month we held our national sales meetings and our largest customer convention in North America the AORN. I have to tell you I was extremely pleased to see that both our sales force and our customers were excited about the new products we've launched. Classic indicators were the V-PRO sterilizer, LED lights, Vision Washer among others. We continue to generate strong free cash flow at $91 million in fiscal 2008 compared with $50 million in 2007. This cash, along with some modest balance sheet leverage allowed us to repurchase 6.8 million shares for a total investment in our stock of $183 million for the year, nearly $200 million including dividends. Mike Tokich will now discuss the numbers in more detail. Michael?
Mike Tokich: Thank you, Walt. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be with you this morning to discuss our financial performance for the final quarter of fiscal 2008. We had a very strong quarter to close out fiscal 2008, but before I get into the details, there are two moving parts in our numbers for the quarter. So for clarity, let me remind you that included in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 are pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $16.5 million. $15.8 million relates to our previously announced expense reduction program and consists of cost associated with severance and related benefits, rationalization of certain product lines and the closure of sales offices. The remaining $700,000 relates to our transfer of manufacturing operations from Erie to Mexico. Of the $16.5 million in restructuring charges, $12.4 million is recorded as restructuring expense and $4.1 million is recorded in cost of goods sold. Also, included in net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 is restructuring expenses of $1.1 million relating to our Erie to Mexico manufacturing transfer. Now let me walk you through the income statement. Fourth quarter revenue increased 7%, reflecting growth in all three business segments. Organic growth for the quarter was 5% with 3% from volume and 2% from pricing. Foreign currency translation contributed 2%. Gross margin in the quarter, excluding restructuring, was 41.4% and equal to the prior year. Although we have been successful in implementing price increases and are benefiting from labor savings resulting from our transfer of manufacturing operations from Erie to Mexico, we are still incurring cost increases relating to raw materials and freight, plus an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Raw material cost increased $5 million in the quarter versus last year. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses excluding restructuring were 25.8% in the fourth quarter compared with 26.3% in the prior year, a result of the expense controls we began several months ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.2% compared with 41.4% in the prior year. The fiscal 2008 quarter was impacted by profitability from outside the United States, a favorable settlement of the 1999 through 2001 IRS audit and favorable discrete item adjustments. Net income, excluding restructuring, was $36.4 million or $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of 26% as compared with net income of $30.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Moving on to segment. As a result of organizational changes during the quarter, the company has changed its methodology for reporting segments. The company will now import four segments, Healthcare, Life Sciences, Isomedix and Corporate and other. The Corporate and other segment includes the defense and industrial business unit, businesses in the embryonic stages which were formerly part of Life Sciences, plus costs that are associated with being a publicly traded company, and certain other corporate costs. The other corporate cost include executive office cost, Board of Directors compensation, shareholder services and investor relations, external audit fees and legacy cost of pension and post-retirement benefits from our Erie operation. Within our press release, the prior period results have been adjusted to reflect this new presentation. For clarity, the $16.5 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter has been attributed to the segments in the following manner. $13.8 million attributed to Healthcare, $1.5 million directly to Life Sciences, $400,000 to Isomedix and, $800,000 to the Corporate and other segment. Please note that all my remaining comments on the segments will be based on the amounts that exclude the restructuring charges. Healthcare revenue increased 5% in the quarter driven by service revenues growth of 8% and capital and consumable revenue growth of 5%. Demand trends continue to be strong as we are at a yearend record backlog level of $98 million, which is 54% above the prior year level. Healthcare segment operating margins rate was 18.3% compared with 18.5% in the same quarter last year. The Healthcare segment was impacted by increases in costs relating to raw materials and freight, offset by benefits achieved from pricing and labor savings in Mexico. The segment also incurred higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products. In addition, the segment incurred cost during the quarter associated with a software upgrade of its System One product line. Life Sciences had a very strong quarter with revenue increasing 20% compared with the prior year. Consumable revenue grew 15% while service revenue grew 6%. Capital revenue grew 31% driven largely by the shipment of a record backlog from the pervious quarters as a result of orders in the research market. Backlog for Life Sciences in the quarter decreased 24% as a result of these shipments and it's down 5% from last year to $44.2 million. Life Sciences operating margin rate was 9.7% compared with 7.2% in the same quarter last year, largely reflecting the increase in shipment levels in the business. Isomedix services revenue grew 3% driven by improved price and mix. Volumes were essentially flat relative to a strong fourth quarter in fiscal 2007. Isomedix reported a very strong operating margin rate of 21.1% compared with 17.6% in the prior year period. The increase in operating margin reflected improved pricing mix and lower operating expenses in the segment. Turning to the balance sheet, our DSO level was 72 days compared with 77 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Total inventory at quarter end was $147.2 million compared with $132 million in the prior year quarter. The delta reflects increased raw material costs, new product inventory, high order backlog levels and foreign exchange rate changes. Capital expenditures for the full year were $57 million and depreciation and amortization for the full year was $62.8 million. Net debt at quarter end was $128.1 million representing a net debt to total capital ratio of 15.3%. Given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow position, the drop in stock price early in the quarter and our optimism regarding future performance, we stepped up our share repurchase activity. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of $25.43. For the year, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $26.84 for a total investment of $183 million. Net cash provided by operations for fiscal 2008 was $143 million compared with net cash provided by operation of $95.7 million in fiscal 2007. Free cash flow was $91.1 million for fiscal 2008 compared with free cash flow of $49.5 million last year. The year-over-year improvement in free cash flow was driven by changes of working capital, which includes a prior year payment of $27.6 million to the IRS for tax expenses previously incurred. By all counts, Steris delivered a strong fourth quarter to close out the fiscal year. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver solid earnings performance in fiscal 2009. This concludes my review. I will now turn the call back over to Walt for his comments on 2009. Walt?
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks, Michael. We enter fiscal 2009 in a better position than we began 2008. A number of management changes were behind us, we've begun the process of reducing operating expenses, Monterrey is fully operational, overall demand remains positive in our markets and our new product pipeline is beginning to bear fruits. Although we have much more work to do on operating expenses, we are well down the path in North America and we will follow a similar path in our international operations during 2009. As a result, despite the fact that we anticipate raw material prices to continue to rise and the dollar to remain at historically weak levels, we are bullish that our cost reductions, which are in excess of $50 million when fully implemented including Monterrey, will allow us to invest in our sales channels to put more feet on the street, invest in product development to support our customers future needs, absorb the broad base decline in the dollar, and at the same time, affords a significant earnings improvements in 2009. We are anticipating total revenue growth to be similar to fiscal 2008 in the 4% to 6% range. Healthcare and Isomedix will grow in the mid single digits, while Life Science is expected to grow in the low single digits, as we expect it to be another challenging year for our major pharmaceutical customers. And we hope these demand forecast prove to be conservative. As you know, we enter the year with a strong backlog and order pattern, but we also understand that the politics of US healthcare could impact the demand late this calendar year or early next. And our major pharma customers are under significant pressure. We would rather plan conservatively and have potentially upside if things are better. With these revenue forecast in mind, we anticipate earnings to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share representing between 8% and 19% over fiscal year 2008. We expect the timings of earnings to be weighted about 40-60, 40% in the front half and 60% in the back half of the year. This is somewhat less rear-end weighted than our traditional one-third, two-thirds mix. And a result of growth in revenue overtime, as well as investments made early in the year, particularly in our Isomedix unit which had significant expansion cost built into the first half of the year. To sum up, we are anticipating a good year ahead for STERIS. This coming year, we will see the results of our cost improvement efforts and our stock repurchase program. Looking further out in intermediate term over the next couple of years, we will see the benefit of efforts to better utilize capital and working capital. Market shares gain in our core markets resulting from investment in sales and service and from product developing already in place, an improvement in operations including quality cost and asset utilization. In the longer run, beyond the two-year timeframe, additional investment and focus on our product development efforts will also pay off. As we look beyond 2009, we are confident that this business can generate stronger top line growth, certainly in a high single-digits and that profitability can grow faster than sales. Our focus will be implementation in our key markets. That concludes my remarks for today. And at this time, I will hand it back to Aidan to introduce the Q&A.
Aidan Gormley: Thanks very much, Walt, thank you, Mike. We are ready to begin the Q&A session Sarah so, if you wouldn't mind just give the instruction once again and we can get started.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from the Joshua Zable with Natixis. Your line is open.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Hey guys, thank you very much for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter here and a great outlook.
Walt Rosebrough: Thanks a lot, Josh.
Mike Tokich: Thanks Josh.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: I have a couple of quick question here, so let me get right to them. First, Walter I know you focused this past quarter on making sure the Monterrey stuff was going well, execution was happening. Can you just kind of tell us, I know you obviously talked about how far long you are, but just from here on until sort of everything is finished as far as execution goes what risks are out there? I mean there is always risk, but may be just kind of give us sort of how confident you feel about this transition being completed having gone there and sort of now kind of fixed things up.
Walt Rosebrough: Talking specifically about Mexico?
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Yeah.
Walt Rosebrough: I am highly confident. Again, there is always risk in any operation but they are running as an operation should run, and in fact if anything we look forward to more improvements out of them.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Great, okay, and just running down a line here, just in terms of the outlook just to be clear, obviously some headwinds in terms of materials and life science spending, I imagine, I know you addressed that and you also kind of mention potential for hospital spending slowing. Can you just give us a little bit more color as far as your revenue guidance, what you are sort of factoring in, are you seeing any sort of slowdown today and sort of are you factoring it more in the later part of the year, is it sort of a general factor of your total overall guidance?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. Two statements I guess. The first is on the Life science side, we have been discussing the fact that the pharma customers are pushing out projects overtime and have been out for probably six or eight months for better. And so that is a matter of fact and has influenced their order rates and again you see, they had a huge fourth quarter. But that was largely shipping product that had been ordered year-over-year 18 months earlier kind of stuff. That probably over too much time with, certainly there had been order previously. We also saw a good return in the non-pharma piece of that business, so that went well. We haven't seen cancellation of orders, so what we seen today is just some timing issues we believe. But we do expect their timing to continue. And so I would say that ratable throughout the year more than any prime back in. On the healthcare side, we've continue to see strong order rates you see that in our backlog. And so in terms of that question, we are being cautious I think in particularly in the back half of the year; back of half our year, which is the end of this calendar year and first of next calendar due to the elections, and we have lot of balls in the fire the election going right now, nobody really knows what's going to happen and nobody really knows what actions will really be taken post the elections. So we are being a bit cautious based on that. Uncertainty is the enemy of the capital spending and hospitals not really certainty. So I don't see it as a long-term issue, but we might get caught for a quarter or two or just little uncertainty out there and peoples slow down a bit. We had not seen yet today on our order rate.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Okay, great. And then, just quickly on products obviously, Walter, I know you haven't been there too long. Can you just talk about any new products that are out there right now? If there are anything meaningful, sort of multipart question, and then sort of give us a update on the vapor based sterilization. And then sort of also along those lines with the new sort of corporate and other lines referring to defense industrial and early stage businesses obviously vapor based, I assume is in there. Is there anything, sort of new that we should be aware of that’s particularly exciting that might be in that bucket?
Walt Rosebrough: I'm going to take three part question. First I'll talk about the products. I mentioned really the significant ones in the course of my conservation, but we really have seen some nice response to I call it the major product that are out there LED light which we have already seen significant orders on, and we think we are going to continue to see significant orders on from all the patterns we have seen. The new V-Pro which is one of our new Hydrogen peroxide sterilizers we've had that basic technology in Life Sciences for a while, we've been marketing it to a lesser extent in Europe because of regulatory issues. We do not yet have final clearance for the SCBI which is the biological indicator that goes with that product. So we cannot fully launch the product of the US yet, we are hopeful that we would be imminent and we are very high on that product line, it's an excellent product and our customers has given us very favorable response. The new Vision Washer is the nice product and it kind of does attract. In fact it's more efficient for the user because the timeframes it is more efficient for both the user and environment because its uses much less electricity and it also uses lower and better concentrations of soaps such that it's efficient for the environment. So we think that's going to be a very nice product for us going forward.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Great.
Walt Rosebrough: Those are kind of big ones that have been launched and are out there today. I should to the classics indicators, excuse me I miss that one my mind the classics indicators are also getting very favorable response from our customers. And I would tell you at the AORN which is the operating room show, that has both operating people and then the perioperative environment or the central supply where the sterilizers and washers are used. They had a line of people all they along around the classics indicator, so our people are feeling very good about that. Now turning to Vapor, here I think you are specifically talking about hydrogen peroxide. Again, V-PRO line, it's doing well in early launch. We had some regulatory backup here in US, we have to be completed before we can really, before our customers can begin using it. So that will slow it down until we get that regulatory launch, but we are very comfortable with that one. The other area, I think you might be talking, Josh, about the rooms sterilization that sterilization, the VaproSure, same basic technology, only for a full room as opposed to a sterilization space. That continues as we talked before, I think it will continue to be a slow concepts sale kind of a product. So it's relatively limited in market today, and I think it will be very slow going forward. And we and our customers are trying to figure out the best ways to put that in place. So I think there will be a slow ramp up. I still think there is a good potential for it in the longer run.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: And is there anything else new in that sort of early stage product line then?
Walt Rosebrough: Well, there is nothing else we release or announced Josh, so there's nothing I can talk about. I will talk specifically to your question about D&I though. I think Mike discussed the accounting change there, and we just had really for two reasons. The first is our shareholder have been asking us for more visibility to our earnings, so we are trying to provide that. And second reason is it's important to be clear what those business, defense and industrial are and are not. They are very embryonic businesses. So they're not generating significant revenue and nor significant cost for that matter, but that the two area that we've talked, both the defense area and the industrial Tetra Pak area are the two areas that we are pursuing. But what we have done is reduced our focus or, I should say, focused on those things that are the most likely alternatives. I think we would spread kind of things in those areas looking for things to apply our technologies in those areas and we have a very good potential relationship with Tetra Pak going on. And so we're just focusing on that on industrial side. And let's get that one going and then we'll worry about doing something else later. And the same on the government side, we're focusing on just those areas where we've already done technologies and we know the government's interested and we're interested in what they're doing and we're focusing that research in only those areas where -- because we do contract research there, which is the bulk of revenue. That research is only on areas that we are interested in for furthering their and our joint interest as opposed to going more broadly. So, we clearly have worked to focus those embryonic businesses into something where we can produce in next two, three years. And I think it will be the next two or three years not next two or three months. And then once we get those going, then we'll worry about other things. I think we were a little too broad.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Great. And then just one final one, probably for Mike here, on the share repurchase, obviously you guys have been aggressive out there, which is great. We have a significant amount of cash left that's allocated towards this. Can you just talk to us -- there are different philosophies out there, some companies kind of get the buyback and then they just sort of just go with it and pretty much spend it. Other people are sort of using more strategically in terms of just kind of picking and choosing their spots, having spent a significant amount of money obviously with the stock down in last quarter, obviously providing an opportunity but not with the stock up. Can you give us little bit color on how you guys think about that?
Mike Tokich: Yeah. I think it's the later. We are more strategic in our repurchases. And you have seen that we were opportunistic in the quarter with the stock price being a little bit lower. So as we look forward, we're going to continue to repurchase. And again it all depends on where the stock price is? How we are from a cash flow standpoint moving forward? But we're going to be more strategic and if we get the opportunity, once again to be opportunistic, we will step up and look to do that.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Great. Well, thanks very much. Congrats, guys. I know it's your first sort of official outlook here. So good luck and also I know Julie is out there listening so congrats on the kiddies over there. Thanks, guys.
Mike Tokich: See you Josh.
Aidan Gormley: Thanks very much. Next question, please?
Operator: Daniel Owczarski with Avondale Partners, your line is open.
Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partner: Yes. Thanks. Good morning and congratulations.
Aidan Gormley: Good morning, Dan.
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you, Daniel. I owe you guys a call. I apologize.
Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partner: I wanted to start with Monterrey. I mean can you talk about what seemed to go right? I mean what was the magic bullet in the quarter and why such a dramatic improvement in the productivity?
Walt Rosebrough: Well, it's not so much -- it's what went right and what had historically gone wrong in combination. We just got a bit of the track in the third quarter. And we had some excess turnover, and every operation or anything like this, there is an inflection point. It's well, the kind of the time when things have to all come together and when they don't. And we kind of the end of the third quarter was kind of our inflection point. As you may recall, that we built a lot of inventory out of Erie early in the year in anticipation of Monterrey ramping up. So lot of our shipments of those products were really out vary either in terms of complete units or in terms of subcomponents, the fabricated components. And the third quarter is really when we had to turn the corner on not just assembly, which we had already done but on fabrication. We have run into some fabrication difficulties and again we had some -- a brief period of human resource difficulty and we kind of get through both of those at the same time. Again, having said that, even we were surprised at what a great job those guys did at coming back. We expected them as we said at the end of the third quarter, we expect them to able to produce at our annualize run rate. They more produced at our historic high run rates of Q4. So they did a heck of a job. And one of the things, everything kind of came together, the team together, we got the machines running and it's all working. So it's just one of those things, very difficult to forecast at the inflection point.
Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partner: Okay. And then as a follow-up to that you mentioned the turnover. I mean is that stabilized? Is there still a room for improvement and what can you do as far as work of retention down there?
Walt Rosebrough: Well, there is always room for improvement in turnover. That's a general belief of mine, no matter what. They do have a higher turnover rate then is a typical. But that area has a higher turnover rate than the typical U.S. rate. We're running at about the typical rates and we want and hope to improve that. And we're doing work to make that happen.
Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partner: Anything specific retention wise that you can do?
Walt Rosebrough: Yeah. But I think I'd rather not have that conversation at this point.
Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partner: And then, you mentioned also in your final comments about investment in sales and marketing. Can you give us anymore insight there, what's your planning?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. I mean, first of all, product launches aren't free. So there is a -- you do the product development and people think about that, but product launches cost money. And in fact, our sales meeting this last, I guess two weeks ago now, we had all of our sales people together and they literally had four days of training. We had enough new products out there that it was train, train, train, train. It wasn't a (inaudible) meeting, it was train, train meeting and that cost money. The second and as we do more product, we would expect to see more of that. Second, we have expanded the number of sales people in our North American operation and just in terms of numbers of feet on street and we've focused them -- split, if you will, between the capital size and consumable side. So we're expecting improvements in our sales force out of both those moves.
Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partner: And then just last question, maybe, Mike, could you give us an idea where the CapEx dollars are going to go this coming year. It sounded like some capacity expansion is there, I'm assuming some amount of routine replacement or any idea where those dollars are going?
Mike Tokich: Yeah. We're anticipating approximately $65 million to be spent. Majority of that is going to be within our Isomedix facility as they have normal replacement of Cobalt and they have continuation of an expansion of one of their facilities. And then we are going to have, as we have a new products coming on board, we have tooling that has to go into our manufacturing facilities. And then just normal maintenance that will occur, building maintenance or machinery maintenance that will occur on an ongoing basis.
Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partner: Okay. Thank you.
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you. 
Aidan Gormley: Next question, please.
Operator: Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti, your line is open.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Yes, hi. Good morning, guys. Just a few questions. I noticed you did mention that production output increased 40% sequentially and you ended the year at record backlog. Any issues in terms of production constraints?
Walt Rosebrough: No. Not at all. The backlog is up because orders are up, which of course is a good thing. But in terms of customer lead times we're bringing those down actually. So, you should expect to see that continuing to come down over the following quarter, just as we described. If anything were ahead what we thought we would in terms of meeting customer demand right now.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Okay. And on the life sciences business, I know you entered the quarter with record backlog and you mentioned it declined 5% heading into the new year, any concerns there or--?
Walt Rosebrough: I just want to clarify to make sure, we had record backlog earlier in the year. We've reduced that backlog. And now it's down about 5% versus the previous year. So, it's not a record at the end of this year. And I don't know if we misspoke or you may have or…
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Right. In the quarter, yeah.
Walt Rosebrough: I may have misunderstood you. But in any event, at the end of the year and end of the fourth quarter, we were about 5% down compared to previous year. In terms of concern, naturally we would like our backlog to be even or up a little bit versus a previous year. We are seeing basically what we've describes, some slowness in timing in the order patterns of the pharma guys and continuing good order on the other side of Life Science. And that's why we forecast a lower growth rate in the previous year.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Okay. And again, you thrown up tremendous free cash flow and you've been using it to buyback stock. Any thoughts or anything on the acquisition front that could be -- cash could be used towards?
Walt Rosebrough: Sure. We will continue to look at opportunities that are adjacent to our current primary products and markets. And to the extent that there is something that fits into that, we would consider. Having said that, our primary work, I think is to do a great job in those core markets. And so we will keep cash in reserves. And we still we have a significant cash reserve between cash and debt for opportunistic purchases that make sense. But we also think we have room to buy back stock.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Okay. And on price increases, again, I think about you've been able to implement increases to help offset raw material cost et cetera. Do you feel that you still have that ability do it in fiscal '09?
Walt Rosebrough: In general, we do raise prices to work to offset those material cost increases. We have two issues with that. First is, we are often bidding out in the future. So you have to bid the anticipation of cost increases. So what hurts us is unanticipated material cost increases. That's number one. And of course, what helps us is unanticipated cost decrease. So that's one issue. And the second issue is, in general, we have not included things like surcharges or whatever on our products. The hospitals want those as a bid, if you will. Here's a price and we're in a competitive pricing mode at the time. So, as all of us are incurring cost decreases, we are able to pass on price increases, but not if all of us aren't. And the second issue is in general in this industry, where one gets improvement on price relative to cost, in general that's when you develop new products. And so typically the path to price cost differential is new products, not straight price increases.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Okay. Thanks. And finally, again, with regard to the guidance you issued, are you assuming any uptick in hospital construction or spending given, as you said, the uncertain political outlook?
Walt Rosebrough: Again, we are anticipating 4% to 6% growth for the year in that in total, and obviously, hospitals were in that range, but a little higher because of the lower growth in Life Science. But kind of the long and short out of it is, we're not looking for any major increase or expansion in building nor are we looking for any major decline in building expansion. I think at this point that's reasonable. Again it really boils down to -- my experiences boogeyman on capital spending for hospitals is not so much what's real, it's uncertainty. Once the people who are in charge of hospitals understand what their new deal is, they are very good at working to improve their positions and get in good shape. So, its typically an uncertainty question for two months or three months or six months or year, and we just don't know what's going to happen in the political environment, so we're being little cautious there.
Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: Okay. Thanks again, guys.
Walt Rosebrough: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Greg Halter with the Great Lakes Review, your line is open.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Good morning.
Walt Rosebrough: Good morning, Greg.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: I believe in the past you've spoken about an expansion for the Isomedix business in Minneapolis. I am just wondering if you could comment on how that is progressing, as well as any others you may be working on as well?
Walt Rosebrough: I don't happen to recall if we discuss that particular one. In general our expansions are going well. We do have a significant expansion going this year. We've not spoken publicly about that location. We have a number of smaller expansions going on, and it's just a typical part of our process. But all things are going well and they continue to fill kind of all their vessels. They're doing a nice job. Easiest way to say it is we work hard not to expand without knowing what customers are going to bringing into those facilities. So we tend to try to tie up a few long-term contracts within an expansion and then we have to fill the balance of the vessels. That's their tradition and they've continued down that path.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Given all the concern over E. coli and food products and so forth, any new initiatives or impetus in that particular area for the Isomedix facilities?
Walt Rosebrough: That really -- although there's all kinds of concern out there, that has really not materialized in any significant way, so far. So the answer to that at this point is no.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And you had mentioned I believe that raw material cost were about $5 million higher than at this time last year. Is that the type of increase you expect on year-over-year basis going forward or will it be even more severe than that?
Mike Tokich: On a year-over-year basis, it will be more severe than that. It will be two to three times that.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: For how many quarters?
Mike Tokich: For the full year.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay.
Mike Tokich: We would spread that two to three times over the full year impact.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay.
Walt Rosebrough: I think all of us are kind of in a situation where there's a lot of moving parts in material cost right now. Oil is bouncing around. Steel has clearly been bouncing hard lately. Stainless steel which is one of the big components we had problems last year is actually softened a little bit. Nickel is not as tough as it -- this time going forward is not as tough as it was. We're watching a lot of variables at the same time.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay.
Walt Rosebrough: It's along with, I think everybody in the business right now.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: So those new products really are key in terms of the price increases if you will?
Walt Rosebrough: Product is always important.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Any new information on the DOJ investigation?
Walt Rosebrough: There is nothing new to report.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And two last house keeping ones questions. Do you have any short-term debt on the balance sheet?
Walt Rosebrough: Yes, we have $700,000 of short-term debt and that's been consistent for last two years at least.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: All right. And finally what was the total for the consumable service recurring revenues as an entire company for the quarter and the year I guess?
Walt Rosebrough: You're talking about number or percentages?
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Numbers or percentages either way?
Walt Rosebrough: Total recurring was approximately 7% for the year.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: 7 or 70?
Walt Rosebrough: 7.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay.
Walt Rosebrough: 70 would be tremendous, 7 is where we're at. I think capital business is recurring too. We all have different view on that.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Yeah, the number we used on recurring revenues for fiscal '07 was $688 million which includes the consumables, the service and whatever else you may have in there?
Walt Rosebrough: Yeah, well the total recurring for fiscal '08 was 737 Greg.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Mike Hughes with Delaware Investments, your line is open.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments: Good morning, couple of questions. Just a point of further clarification on the order backlog, you touched on this earlier. But up 54% year-over-year, last quarter you were benefited in a big way by the issues in Mexico. Are you saying that that backlog at this point doesn't include kind of some delays in shipping because Mexico is kind of at the level production it needs to be at or is that still up 54% of still being benefited from the issue that you had last quarter too?
Walt Rosebrough: No, I mean clearly we were behind relative to our normal shipping pattern last quarter. We are working out of that. But we're not completely out of that. But I guess what I'm saying is we are not losing ground in Mexico any longer, in fact we're gaining ground. We have strong orders across our business and across our plan. So although that increase in backlog is not Mexico, again we just had very strong capital orders in the hospital side the last six months. So good piece of backlog is not related to Mexico.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments: Okay. And then the earnings guidance 150 to 165 there was a lot of variability, more so than even at operating leverage involved with that the 4% to 6% revenue range. So what would it take to hit the high end and conversely built a low end?
Walt Rosebrough:  I would say at the high end if the dollar strengthens instead of weakens which has a lot of play on both our FX and our material cost. If we capture all of the costs, we have a range that we're working in some of the cost reduction we're doing. We know we'll get them it's just a matter of when we get them. So it's the rapidity with which we capture those cost and than where the revenues come out particularly in the back half of the year. That's I guess would my big three and the low end it's the reverse scenario.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments: Okay. And the 150 to 165 does that include any non-recurring cost related to restructuring that you can't back out?
Mike Tokich: No there are no restructuring costs included in that $50 to $65.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments: Okay, great. Thank you very much
Walt Rosebrough:  Thanks, Mike. Next question please.
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back for any closing remark.
Aidan Gormley:  Okay. Well thanks very much everyone. That concludes our fiscal 2008 fourth quarter call.

So with those cautions I’d like to hand you over Mike who will begin our financial review. Mike?
Michael Topich: Thank you Aidan. Good morning everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning to discuss our financial performance during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. After my comments, I’ll turn the call over to Walt for his remarks. Let me begin with the income statement. Third quarter revenue increased 5%, reflecting growth in all three business segments. For the quarter, pricing contributed 2% and changes in foreign currency rates contributed another 2%. Gross margin in the quarter was 41.5%, compared with 42.7% in the prior year. Although we have been successful in implementing price increases and are benefiting from labor savings resulting from our transfer of manufacturing operations from Erie to Mexico, we are still incurring significant cost increases relating to raw materials and inflationary increases in labor and freight.  As a percent of revenue, operating expenses were 30.8% in the third quarter, compared with 31.4% in the prior year period. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved 30 basis points while research and develop expenses increased 50 basis points. Due to a continued emphasis on new product development and product enhancement efforts, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1% compared with 36.2% in the prior year quarter. The fiscal 2008 quarter was favorably impacted by discrete item adjustments and a change in estimate on a permanent tax adjustment. For the full year, the company anticipates its effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.  Net income was $21.8 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, as compared to $21.3 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the prior year period. As a reminder, our profitability was impacted by restructuring expenses which negatively impacted diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 by $0.01 and $.04 respectively. In addition, the fiscal 2007 third quarter included a gain related to our discontinued operations which contributed one penny to diluted earnings per share. Moving on to segment results, healthcare revenue increased 5% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in consumable revenue of 12% and service revenue growth of 7%.  Capital revenue was essentially flat during the quarter as we are experiencing a slower than anticipated ramp up in production levels at our new Monterrey, Mexico manufacturing facility which along with order growth has lead to record backlog levels. Backlog in the healthcare segment increased 14% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to reach $107.3 million. The healthcare segment continues to be impacted by significant cost increases relating to raw materials and inflationary increases in labor and freight which more than offset the benefits achieved from pricing and labor savings in Mexico. In addition, the segment incurred higher operating costs as we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products along with added selling expenses relating to our growth initiatives. As a result, the segment operating margin rate was 11.9% compared with 12.2% in the same quarter last year.  Life sciences revenue increased 5% compared with the prior year, driven by growth across a broad array of product lines. Consumables revenues grew 8%, service revenue grew 5% and capital revenue grew 4%. While the segment experienced growth in the research capital market, delayed project activity among customers in pharmaceutical manufacturing affected revenue in the quarter. Backlog for life sciences in the quarter increased 30% year-over-year and 1% sequentially to a record $58.3 million. Life sciences reported operating income of $800,000 in the quarter, compared with $2.5 million in the same period last year.  Operating income was negatively impacted by increased research and development expenses related to product enhancements and by foreign exchange translation. Isomedix services revenue grew 4% by routine price increases and increased demand from our core medical device customers. Isomedix reported operating income of $6.4 million in the quarter, compared with $5.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating income reflects the increased volumes and pricing. Turning to the balance sheet, our DSO level was 59 days, compared with 64 days in the third quarter of last year, reflecting an increased focus on payment collection efforts, especially within Europe. Total inventory at quarter end was $164.4 million, compared to $147 million in the prior year quarter. The difference reflects increased raw material costs, new product inventory and targeted inventory production levels in anticipation of increased volumes in the quarter.  Capital expenditures were $17.6 million and depreciation and amortization was $16 million during the quarter. For the full year, we continue to anticipate the capital expenditures will be approximately $55 million, while depreciation and amortization will be approximately $60 million. Looking at cash flow, our net cash provided by operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 was $94.5 million compared with net cash provided by operations of $41.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2007. Free cash flow was $60.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2008, compared with free cash flow of $10.9 million in the same prior year period. The year-over-year improvement in free cash flow was driven by a reduction in accounts receivable balances and a prior year payment of $27.6 million to the IRS for tax expenses previously incurred.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the company completed the sale of its Erie, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility which added $4.7 million to free cash flow. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for a total amount of $40.6 million. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for a total of amount of $96.3 million. Currently we have approximately $225 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization program. For the fiscal year, the company continues to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $80 million. This concludes my review for the third quarter. I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. I want to also add my thanks for all of you taking the time to be with us today. I’d like to share my perspective on the quarter and also highlight some of the significant trends we are seeing in our business. Generally speaking demand trends continue to be positive. We sustained revenue growth in all three segments this quarter and demand is even more robust as evidenced by record backlog levels. In fact, our year-to-date order growth is 8% across the entire business. The single biggest issue, versus our expectations, was that our revenue is constrained by delays in our ramp up at our new Mexican production facility. I’m going to focus on that issue for a few minutes because there is a bit of short term bad news but the overall and long term news is good.  Although the plant is now running at about our average monthly production rate for this year, as you know we expected to ship significantly more product in the back half of the year than we did in the first half. The production ramp-up delays have prevented us from shipping product commensurate with our order rate and our plan. Even though our capacity continues to grow, we will not ship as much as planned in the fourth quarter. If we were able to ship all, or nearly all of the orders we have in-house for the fourth quarter, as we have in past years, we would exceed our revenue estimates for the year. We now expect to be below our revenue plan for the year despite an actual order pattern that is better than anticipated and that would sustain our original projections.  The good news is that generally our lead time requirements from customers are long for these capital products so there has been minimal, if any impact, on our ability to meet customer requirements. The other good news is that although we are disappointed that the plant has come up to speed a bit slower than we planned, we are very pleased that the steepest part of the ramp-up is behind us. I mentioned in the call last quarter that I have not yet visited the Monterrey plant. Since that call, I have reviewed the plant and I am impressed with the facility and the people. I’m greatly encouraged by the fact that we are now producing at run rates that meet normal customer requirements. Unfortunately we just can’t catch up to our higher than normal year-end shipments all at once. I’m confident we will be able to work down the backlog next year, just not at the rate that would allow us to hit our planned performance in the fourth quarter.  The other good news is that we are seeing a positive impact of lower costs at this facility and we expect the impact to grow as we get fully up to speed. Ignoring the impact of slower revenue recognition from the plant, the transfer will have a net positive impact of $4 million to $6 million in pre-tax operating profit this year. That is compared with our original estimate of $6 million to $8 million. We believe our long term estimates of annual savings are still very much on track.  Now let me take a moment to discuss each segment. First regarding healthcare, our largest segment, the demand trends in healthcare are generally positive with solid order growth and record backlog levels. Although Mexico production levels muted volume growth, we did achieve pricing improvement as well as the labor savings from our move to Mexico. Supplementing general market demand, we continue to make progress with our new products. For example, the response to the third quarter introduction of our new LED light has been outstanding. We have fared very well in head-to-head trials and expect a continued increase in volume levels during the fourth quarter and beyond. This product is consistent with our strategy of offering a better and broader array of products in to the operating room sweep to deliver better performance and reduce costs for our customers; at the same time, increasing our revenue per room opportunity. Also within healthcare, our reliant TPS product continues to gain momentum as an alternative to the use of aldehyde systems for high level disinfections in GI departments. And finally, we are in the process of launching our new v-probe VHP sterilizer. The V-probe 1 technology platform is environmentally friendly, safe, and easy to use. It offers substantial processing capacity and is designed to compete with existing low temperature gas sterilization systems. These systems are used to process heat sensitive medical devices in hospital sterile processing departments. These new products are expected to supplement an already broad portfolio solutions to address the critical infection prevention needs of our customers.  In terms of overall profitability in healthcare, while we have improved pricing and captured labor savings, lower volume throughput and increased raw material costs have offset those improvements. Additionally, we have invested in selling and marketing expenses to launch our new offerings and new product development to develop recent released and future new products. While we expect margin improvement in the fourth quarter for healthcare, as we increase production levels we will fall short of our overall expected profitability for the year in that segment.  Turning now to life sciences, revenue growth in life sciences remains modest this quarter relative to the double digit increases we anticipated. While we have made a significant turnaround in our research business, our North American pharmaceutical customers have been cautious with manufacturing expansions and in some cases we have seen projects delayed that we originally believed would generate revenue for us in this fiscal year. Continued growth in overall drug consumption levels is a positive micro trend for us. And our business is more a function of the volume of drug consumption than drug pricing. We anticipate a continued shift in pharmaceutical manufacturing to facilities outside North America and are positioned to capitalize on that trend. In fact, during the third quarter we did see significant year-over-year growth in our Asian operations. However, lower than planned volumes in our pharmaceutical manufacturing business, along with foreign exchange variances due to the fact that we are often selling European and Canadian built product into the U.S., as well as some delays in cost reducing product redesign efforts has had a detrimental impact on margins in this business. As a result, we anticipate the revenue growth and margins for the full year will be below where we expected them to be.  Finally, turn to Isomedix. Isomedix continued its steady pace of growth with sustained pricing levels and stable volume growth. We recently initiated a capacity expansion at our Minnesota location which will help drive some incremental volume next year. We anticipate little change in the revenue outlook for Isomedix relative to our previous forecast and we may do slightly better than expected in margin rate. Across the entire company we have taken actions to stop planned growth in operating expenses in the third and fourth quarters of this year and we will be continuing to scrutinize those expenses as we complete our planned forecast for next year. In total, largely as a result of the slower than anticipated ramp-up in Mexico, we are adjusting our earning estimates downward to the range of $1.30 to $1.35 per diluted share. Revenue growth will be in the range of 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. As we progress through the current quarter we will complete a detailed operating plan for fiscal year 2009 and would expect to share our outlook for that year during our fourth quarter conference call in early May. With good market demand, free cash flow in the $80+ million a year range, a strong balance sheet, and new products coming to market, we believe we are well positioned to for the future.  With that I will turn the call back over to Aidan to introduce the Q & A.
Aidan Gormley: Thanks very much Walt and thank you Mike for your comments. We’re now ready to begin the Q & A session so Holly can you just give the instructions and we can get started?
Operator: Our first question comes from Steven Missen with Mindpro Capital. Your line is open.
Steven Missen - Mindpro Capital: Yeah, a couple of questions Walt. Obviously it’s been very challenging since you joined the company last year but I know you guys should be able to light the ship. A couple of things regarding operational improvement initiative, what are you guys doing in terms of factoring TPM Six Sigma throughout your plans to overall improve throughput? I know you talked about production levels being down, so what do you plan to do for 2008 to help your plans and prove throughput with some of the different types of initiatives out there?
Walter Rosebrough: I would step back... first of all the production capacity constraint has nothing to do with either lean or six sigma type initiatives. It’s the fact that we started a new plant in Mexico. So first of all that issue is clearly not a function of those variables.
Steven Missen - Mindpro Capital:  Okay.
Walter Rosebrough: Having said that, we have, and I’ve been actually pleased since coming on board that the guys in production have begun a couple of years ago working down the TPS, Total Protection System or lean system. We have a long way to go. We are early in that process. But that’s clearly an area that is, in my view, of great interest. Particularly on the manufacturing side, I believe that is the preferred approach to improving our processes and that’s something we will definitely be working on in coming years.
Steven Missen - Mindpro Capital: In terms of metrics to measure manufacturing facilities, are you looking at OE, Rona? A lot of executives in the industry [semiters] are measured upon both types of metrics. How are you guys measuring yourself to see, hey are we doing the right job in the right plant?
Walter Rosebrough: We do look at profitability and return metrics. I will tell you that when you’re really working your way down the lean path the single best metric to look at is inventory because inventory reduction is a significant part of that process, getting flow. And that is clearly where we are not excelling right now, so we have great opportunities for improvement there.
Steven Missen - Mindpro Capital: And what targets do you have for inventory reduction? Have you set any target levels for this year, to reduce it by a certain percentage?
Walter Rosebrough: We have not set those targets as of yet. But I can tell you we’re a long way from them.
Steven Missen - Mindpro Capital: Follow up question. Going into the remainder of ’08 is obviously is very challenging for a lot of factors, you said yourself, what systems or solutions are you going to be putting in place to accelerate your continuous improve initiative and what benefits do you expect to see out of that to let the shareholders know, hey we’re doing the right job?
Walter Rosebrough: The two areas that... again, I’m going to separate two different questions, two different things. The first is kind of the lean initiatives and the two areas that we will clearly be focusing on are quality and inventory. Those are the areas one always focuses on in those processes. So we will be doing that. The second piece again is really – comes back to the question – which in the short run is more significant to our revenue and as a result profitability is moving forward in the Monterrey, Mexico facility ability to produce. And there, again, we are monthly improving that capability and significantly improving that capability and you will see that in our revenues month after month, quarter after quarter. You’ll see it more on a revenue perspective that way. The other measures, the more internal measures are things that we will be looking at. But clearly you’ll be seeing inventory. Our inventory levels are high relative to what they need to be if we’re a lead manufacturer.
Steven Missen - Mindpro Capital: Are you guys putting in new ERP systems to manage that? What are you actually doing? Are you putting in new capacity, hiring more labor from low cost countries? What are you guys doing?
Walter Rosebrough: Okay, two answers. First of all, we do have ERP systems in place. So that’s really not the issue. In fact, if anything, inside the factory as you pull systems you somewhat reduces your reliance on those ERP systems inside the factory, still box to box, you rely on them. The second part of your question is, in Monterrey, clearly one of the things we have been doing over the course of this year is bringing people on board and training. There have been two bottlenecks there. The first has been getting machinery up or back up depending, and we’ve clearly had some constraints there and we are doing a nice job of getting our run time capabilities back up. The second area is the people constraints and we are working diligently to make sure that we get those people in, train them well so they do a quality job and we do not want to lose our focus on quality as we move forward on the quantity side. But clearly we’re doing that and they are making significant progress in that we have ramped up... The people hired have continued to ramp up over the course of this past year. Again, I would step back and say... By the way, it is very disappointing to us as a company and it’s disappointing particularly who are working on that project to be behind what they expected. But having said that, they really got on the ground in Mexico about 18 months ago, so if you think about what they did in transferring a, I don’t know, century old plant out of Erie, Pennsylvania into a green field site in Monterrey, Mexico and getting the kind of cost savings that we will eventually fully achieve, it’s not a small task. I hesitate to say they’ve done a great job, because we’re behind our expectations, but I will tell you it’s not an easy task and they’re doing a nice job.
Steven Missen - Mindpro Capital: Okay and final question from me on ’08. What would you say is the top challenge that you want to tell shareholders you’re taking on and what is the goal you would like to accomplish in your first full year as CEO of Steris?
Walter Rosebrough: I think we’ll talk more about our significant objectives and challenges in the next conference call. But we clearly have issues. But right now, I’ll tell you in the short strokes our number one challenge is getting Monterrey fully up to speed. That’s not what I would have told you the day I walked in the door but as of about 60 days ago, I would have clearly said that’s the number one challenge and we are moving forward on that.
Steven Missen - Mindpro Capital: Thank you very much.
Walter Rosebrough: Thank you. 
Operator: Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review, your line is open.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review:  Thank you. Good morning.
Walter Rosebrough: Good morning Greg.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: You talked in your release about routine pricing within the Isomedix division or segment? Can you discuss what sort of range that pricing increases came out to be?
Walter Rosebrough: Yeah. I mean typically in Isomedix we’re able to capture ongoing price increases so it wasn’t something specific, which is why we described it as routine Greg. Usually in the Isomedix business we’re able to capture 2 to 3 percentage points of growth from pricing.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay.
Walter Rosebrough: Generally in the range of inflation with the exception of where we can... There are certain products that have fast turn-around demand or issues related to specific types processing where we’re able to capture a little bit more.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Given all the increased worries over food and food supply and so forth, is anything new or different happening within the Isomedix business or any of your other businesses relative to food safety?
Walter Rosebrough: It’s really not a focus going forward for Isomedix. It hasn’t been for some time. The vast majority of our volumes in Isomedix are what I call medical related. As we announced before, we’re applying our proprietary VHP technology in the food and beverage industry with a specific research agreement with Tetrapak. So those are the opportunities that we’re limited to today. It’s a future area of focus but not a significant drive strategically at this point in time.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Can you comment on how large your business outside of either North America or outside of the United States as a percentage of the total?
Walter Rosebrough: For the quarter, we were approximately 23% international revenues.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And, relative to Europe, which I think is somewhere between 10% and 15% of the total, you had some commentary a couple of quarters ago or maybe last quarter about returning that particular area to profitability or increasing the profitability there and just wondered if you could comment on how things are moving in that direction?
Walter Rosebrough: I think we’ve seen good improvement, significant improvement in fact, in our European operations from profitability standpoint. I think we had originally said that our initial goal is to get to break even level and we’ve been able to achieve that this year.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, great.
Walter Rosebrough: Having said that, “break even,” obviously that a long term goal and we intend to improve that going forward.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And relative to Mexico, are there any further restructuring charges or expenses anticipated out of that move, the transition from Erie to Mexico?
Walter Rosebrough: Yeah, for the fourth quarter we’re anticipating approximately another million dollars in the fourth quarter for restructuring expenses relating to that move.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: And will that be it, or will there be more that bleed over into fiscal ’09?
Walter Rosebrough: Currently we believe that that will be the end of the restructuring charges for the Mexico move.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. You had some commentary about the orders and so forth given the Mexican plant situation and just wanted to confirm or reiterate your comments on the loss or potential loss of orders or any that have actually occurred relative to what’s going on there. Have you seen anything in that area or just if you could expand on your previous comments?
Walter Rosebrough: I guess my comments pretty well stand but I will expand a little bit. Again, these are capital items that are... typically planned well in advance by our customers and we have, because again relatively long lead times, we have some amount of flexibility in working with our customers moving... They may have said, gee they’re going to get this thing two months in advance of when they plan on putting it into place and then their project slips a little bit and we work with them. We work with them anyway. It’s not unusual for us to have built something and somebody calls and says hey, “keep it on the shelf for another month, please.” So we have a fair amount of ability to mix and match and move products, so if we have a customer that needs something quickly we can substitute for somebody who’s not as --- who doesn’t have such an urgent need. So we really haven’t seen significant issues there. That’s not to say... it is more challenging at this moment than it is typically for us, but we’re not seeing losses as a result of that. And because we’re ramping up our production ramp up is ramping up faster than our growth, I do not see that being short term or long term problem. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Good.
Walter Rosebrough: I will say though, it’s worth mentioning that orders... It is common for us to have orders that are not just Mexican production. So, for example they may have an order for two sterilizers that are coming out of Mexico and a washer coming out of Canada and, particularly for international orders or lights and tables because they’re going to do a whole new operating room and some place internationally or domestically it’s very common for washers and sterilizers to be shipped at the same time. So, if we ask our customers to take the sterilizer two weeks late, they’re not hot to take the washer. So, although the Mexico production issue is the issue that is causing some of those delays, it does cause delays across our capital operation. So we will... if you understand the logic there?
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Right.
Walter Rosebrough: So that’s why the impact can be greater than just the delay in Mexico. Again, it’s not a customer impact. They take it two weeks later. They’re happy to take it two weeks later, but that’s something ... you know there’s a washer sitting in Quebec waiting to go with the sterilizer that can’t go out of Mexico for example.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And relative to your... the brochure in the hospital area I know you had indicated the first orders from five hospitals on the last call, has that ramped up from that level and can you provide any additional input relative to that product?
Walter Rosebrough: As I mentioned last time, that practice is going to be a concept sale and we had a kind of cluster of orders. I think we’ve had a couple since then, but it’s in that range. We’re in the single digit numbers, not in the double digit numbers in orders and I expect that will be slow and it will ramp up. I do think the product has a solid potential in that arena, but it’s a concept sale and we’re going to have to work that one.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Anything new to report on the DOJ investigation?
Walter Rosebrough: There’s really nothing to report.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And system one, I would expect there’s got to be a replacement cycle coming on, or maybe it already has. I just wonder if you could speak to that.
Walter Rosebrough: Well, I will say as a general statement that one of the areas that I feel strongly about is that all capital types of equipment will last virtually to infinity if you don’t give customers a reason to change and so I would say that about system one and every other one of our pieces of capital equipment. If we don’t do something to cause our customers to want to change because we’re doing something better for them so we have a technological reason to change the market size for the business will be smaller than it should be. We don’t speak to kind of new product releases until it’s time, but as a statement of generality, you can assume that to be the case of kind of every product we have on the shelf.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. That’s good to hear. That’s kind of refreshing actually. And one last one if I might? Just wondering if I could get your thoughts on the either hospital construction or hospital spending environment, currently?
Walter Rosebrough: You know, right now our pattern of orders as well as activity is strong. And we’ve been in kind of a strong market for a reasonable period. I think, I think... not I think, I know that healthcare spending is a political question as much or more than a demand question. The underlying demand is virtually infinite. It is a political question in... we’ll be facing that political question sometime next year. In the end I don’t see... there are ups and downs year-over-year, but in the end the long term demand has been very positive and I expect it to be.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Joshua Zable with Natixis, your line is open.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  First of all on pricing, I know you said you did get a price increase through... but we’ve heard obviously raw material costs keep going up. I guess this is sort of a two-part question. One is it just a simple price increase or is this sort of a raw material increase and on a go-forward basis is that something we can see going forward? You know, obviously I think most customers understand what’s going out there on the material side. And then B, are we seeing any sort of tapering off of these costs in any way, just given the way certain materials have acted?
Walter Rosebrough: The biggest material that caught us this year Josh, as you know is stainless steel. We got hammered early in the year. The good news is that prices seem to be moderating. Actually, we got hammered some late last year and then early this year. That price seems to be moderating. Not that it’s dropping significantly but it’s not rising as it was.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Right.
Walter Rosebrough: And so, you know, I think, touch wood, the worst of that is over. We have had a couple of other; I would call them relatively routine cost increases. And then we had a couple of things on our plate that we had hoped to moderate prices on, that is to redesign our way out of. Some of which we’ve been able to do and some of which we have not been able to do. But I do think the... this quarter, as well as the going quarter coming, the fourth quarter. We don’t see the ramp up we saw in the first half of the year. In terms of price, it’s kind of... the good news and bad news is we negotiate price in a two-fold way with our predominantly healthcare customers particularly the U.S. hospital customers. As you know, there are buying groups and we negotiate those kind of on an annual basis and we fix our prices so we pretty much live with material cost increases. Of course we try to forecast them, we try to build them into our prices and then we try to recapture, just as you said when things get a little out of hand we try to recapture in subsequent periods. We have some ability to do that and we have moderated our discounting because there is some individual projects discounted outside the group purchasing order agents. We have moderated that as a result of the steel prices, stainless steel prices I should say.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay, then on the foreign exchange you guys obviously benefited. Can you just give us an idea of how to think about it, you know going forward? Obviously you’ve given us revenue guidance for the fourth quarter so, it’s less important. But on a more future, sort of looking into next fiscal year, I know you don’t want to give formal guidance but just as far as whether or not, you know, it should be a benefit or a hindrance, I guess.
Walter Rosebrough: Well if the exchange rates continue as they are, we should be getting a benefit and I would say that benefit should be around a 1% benefit as it is for the year, this year. So that’s the best guess we have at this point and time.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay. No, that’s helpful.
Walter Rosebrough: You know Josh, as well as most domestic manufactures know the dollar softens when you’re selling outside the U.S. You get a little wind and that’s what’s happened to us here.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Uh, that’s great. And then, just again going back to... you know you sort of broke out the 5% with the FX and the price increases. We really appreciate that and you said the order increases 8%. I guess just to reiterate and understand, because I’m getting 1% of volume there, but I subtract the other two... but that’s more of a function of sort of capacity or manufacturing issues than order patterns.
Walter Rosebrough: That’s exactly correct Josh.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay. Then just turning quickly to Europe, I know you guys have launched a product relatively recently, it’s been a couple of quarters now. Can you just talk about sort of market share there and what sort of you’re seeing? Obviously you guys are having significantly more share in the U.S. and sort of efforts are going on over there to take more shares.
Walter Rosebrough: Josh I’m not sure exactly what products you’re talking about.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: The washers . . .
Walter Rosebrough: Okay. As a general statement... I would say first of all we look at our P & R business as a global business and that business is shifting... if you will from industrialized countries to tax havens and less industrialized countries as the pharma manufacturing is going there and we are, since we have been nouveau in those areas, we have set up operations, in the principal ones and we are picking up share in that... We’ve gone from zero to something and so we are picking up share there. And that’s sort of across the line that they sell. In healthcare, we have grown in Europe more rapidly than we have in the U.S. and I believe that market is not growing faster so I think we’ve picked up a little bit of share but it’s not, it’s not huge share.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay, great. And then, can you guys. . . I know you sort of alluded to this on the vapor based technology. Obviously, clearly you are making some investments here in R & D. Is there any other new products? I know you’ve gone commercial with certain ones and I know obviously working with Tetrapak developing things. Is there anything else sort of down the pike here that we should be looking for or anything particularly exciting that you guys are developing?
Walter Rosebrough: Josh, I can talk to that just a little bit. The products that Walt mentioned and his comments are the key product launches that we have ongoing. We’re continuing to look at upgrades or developments efforts with our base product lines such as the washer line and the sterilizer line which we hope to be able to introduce in fiscal 2009. So the key is probably the VHP based technology, V-Pro Sure, V-Pro 1, ongoing introduction of Reliance EPS. We have the LED innovations that we're bringing to market, in addition to OR integration products in surgical, then some of the base products such as washers and sterilizers, we're continuing to upgrade those.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay, great. And then just a couple of questions which you guys probably won’t answer but I got to ask them anyway. Any update on the CFO front?
Walter Rosebrough: You know I don’t have a real update Josh, but I’d rather just tell when I’m there. But I will say I wouldn’t expect to be in the call this time the next call with the same conversation.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay, that’s helpful. And then, Walt I just want to push you a little bit here. I know you kind of alluded to giving us more details on the next call, but you know you have been there for a while. Unfortunately you probably had to deal with us on some of these manufacturing issues that you didn’t anticipate dealing with, but with that said, can you give us any sort of sense of strategy? I know you obviously talked about sort of capital equipment cycle which is great to hear. Anything else, sort of off the cuff that you’re seeing that you know, really excites you or, you know, that you kind of really want to focus on? Obviously early days here, but just something we can kind of hang on to here and look for?
Walter Rosebrough:  Good question. I’m not going to say much Josh. I will say it’s clear the core of the business is the sterilization products in the U.S. in healthcare. And as you radiate out from that, you have growth opportunities. And, you know, I am big on... I’ll call it concentric growth as opposed to trying to go do something brand new. So you can bet it will be something radiating out from those areas. And to be honest with you, I’ve talked about in my conversations, the products we’re launching, what we’re doing. I think that there is some real good movement there and we need to implement what we’re working to do and we need to implement it well. But we’ll talk more next call.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: All right. Thanks for taking all my questions guys. Welcome to the party Walt.
Walter Rosebrough: Thanks Josh. Next question please.
Operator: Jason Ronovech with Paradigm Capital, your line is open.
Jason Ronovech - Paradigm Capital: Good morning guys. I just wanted to get deeper into the production issues. Can you get more specific? Was it related to supply of components, quality control, and employee turnover?
Walter Rosebrough: I would say... I don’t know if you said three or four things, but minus one you were pretty spot on. We did have two or three things. First, this equipment that we moved down from Erie, Pennsylvania to Monterrey, ranges in ages from relatively new to a couple of years old to close to ancient. And as you might expect, and as we should have expected more, some of those pieces of equipment decided to act out a little bit when they landed and so we’ve had more challenge in bringing some of that equipment up than we expected. I believe, you know at the 90% level that has been taken care of. The second area, and you must have been a manufacturing buff... In terms of supply chains, again... now we expected this and the good news is what the guy did is build up supply chain ahead of the move. So, both in terms of, by the way, finished goods as well as the number of the whip components or raw materials. So they did build up ahead but we had some unexpected difficulties in moving some of that across the borders in the timeframe that we wanted to. So that was a little tougher than, I think some people had estimated. And in addition, because some of the equipment didn’t come up, we outsourced some of those components to other manufacturers, but, you know, we did not give them the lead times that they would expect because we didn’t know we were going to be outsourcing. So in an effort to use the capacity we had, we outsourced. So that’s clearly the secondary of the components for the supply chain. And then the third, and the one that did catch us a little bit unawares and is a piece of the reason we were ramping up kind of nicely and then we hit a state of turnover, late summer, early fall in some of the folks that we hired and that put us behind a little as well. Those three things, it wasn’t kind of one big problem, it was this little problem and that little problem and this little problem and that little problem that came together to put us... and I would say we’re running two to three months behind were we would like to be in terms of ramp up.
Jason Ronovech - Paradigm Capital: What do you still need to do to resolve each of those three issues?
Walter Rosebrough: Well, you know, they’re largely resolved. We have hired and trained people. We’ve done a number of things to work on retention of the folks we have and of course there’s a classic issue again when you start from ground zero. Like most situations people who have been with you one month or two months or three months or more have to turnover to the people who have been with you for 20 years and as time passes that one is curing itself, if you will. I have a number of people who that have been on board 15, 18, 24 months and they’re... that piece is improving and hopefully we won’t see another spike in that. We don’t intend to. We have clearly worked on that, that piece of the puzzle. We do have virtually all the machines. I’ve forgotten the exact numbers, but we’re in the 80% up time ratio of the machinery and that’s up significantly from where it was three or four months ago. And since a lot of that is what I’ll call infant failure of a type, its infant failure after you move, it’s not infant failure because of the new machine. Once you get past that, you’re pretty well past it. That one we would not expect to replicate, so I think that will continue to improve and we have continued to hire and trade people so we have a higher number of folks than we have had here before and they are being trained and they’re in good shape. I should mention that one other problem we had was we had an outbound transportation problem that was again unexpected. We obviously transported this product from Erie, Pennsylvania all over North America so there was kind of an assumption that it would transport similarly and particularly in the transfer between ... people knew the type of equipment. This stuff is big and heavy and not easy to move around. Particularly between getting trucking folks up to speed on how to handle that as well as the additional handling and customs. We found that we needed to improve our packaging, as well as our training in terms of handling those systems and we’ve gotten that behind us too. Those are the biggest areas that were problems and again there are problems everyday in manufacturing but... we’ve kind of passed the big ones.
Jason Ronovech - Paradigm Capital: So, you’re thinking there’s residual impact on the fourth quarter. In the first quarter there really shouldn’t be any discussion of production problems in Mexico?
Walter Rosebrough: Unless our order, our growth rate goes way up that would be my expectation.
Jason Ronovech - Paradigm Capital: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Mike Hughes with Delaware Investments, your line is open.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments: Good morning, a couple of questions. Just looking at the healthcare backlog, obviously there is... 22% every year. Can you give us an idea of what that number would have been if you didn’t have the production issues in Mexico? Just a rough number.
Walter Rosebrough: Approximately 30% increase was related to Mexico. So sterilizers were approximately $15 million of that increase. Then you’d be back down to around $90 million. I would say the easiest way to think about is --- and I’m not sure we’ve done that math. And like I said, because it may affect other products as well but kind of the way we’re looking at it is what would we have looked like if we had shipped our growth rate as opposed to shipping what we could produce? Which is normally what you’d expect, right? The backlog rises typically with your growth rate. It doesn’t rise faster than your revenue growth rate --- order growth rate, excuse me. So since I haven’t done that mathematics to know the exact number, it’s a difference between 8% and 5% is not a bad way to look at it. So I would have expected our backlog to be up about 8% consistent with our order rate as opposed to whatever it is... 20% or 30%. Consistent with where we are.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments: Okay. And then, you talked about pricing and how that works. The backlog, I’m assuming that you posted these orders over the last, I don’t know, year or so. So is there an issue, is this backlog works through and converts to revenue that it’s going to carry a lower gross margin? Do you kind of need to bleed through that?
Walter Rosebrough: Uh, well that is a “yes” and “no” problem. You are correct. Those orders get booked over time but also our prices have been rising over time. So both numbers are moving. You understand what I’m saying?
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments:  Yes I do.
Walter Rosebrough: Both numbers are moving. I don’t think it’s any worse than what we; have currently experienced. That’s probably the best way to answer the question. Our costs have risen, our prices have risen. They’re both moving and I don’t see that spread rising at this point and time. Historical turns in backlog, specifically with healthcare is 60 days. It’s longer than that in life sciences, so we may have a little bit more impact in life sciences but our healthcare backlog should be at relatively increased prices at this point.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments:  Okay. And then on the restructuring costs, I think the current quarter, meaning the December quarter was hit by a penny and you’re saying about a million dollars in the March quarter. Do you have the year-to-date for the first nine months? What that number was?
Walter Rosebrough: Yeah, it was actually $3 million for the first nine months of the year for restructuring expenses. So for the full year we’ll have approximately $4 million impact from restructuring.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments:  Okay. And then, I think you indicated savings for the full year related to the Mexico transition, $4 million to $6 million. The original plan was $6 million to $8 million. So, you pick up the incremental $2 million next year and then something above and beyond that I assume?
Walter Rosebrough: We’re not ready with the forecast but something above that would be a very good statement.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments: Okay. One last question. You mentioned the European margins, I think around break even and you said that wasn’t your long term goal. What’s your long term goal for Europe at this point?
Walter Rosebrough: Again, I don’t have numbers on that, but as a general statement I don’t see any reason that Europe and North America can’t look similar in the long run.
Mike Hughes - Delaware Investments:  Okay. Thank you.
Walter Rosebrough: Thank you. 
Operator:  Sam Shapiro with Shapiro Capital, your line is open.
Sam Shapiro - Shapiro Capital: Walt I want to congratulate you and your management team. You have announced seven straight quarters of disappointments. Statement one. Number two Walt, you’ve been there I think four or five months, when we met you said you were going to buy some stock. You’re making all these statements about what you’re going to do and you don’t own a share of stock, other than what was given to you. I was curious, when can other share holders expect for you to make an investment in all of your conversations that you have made today?
Walter Rosebrough: Sam, I think I’ll correct you on one statement, that is I have not given forward leaning conversations about whether I am or not buying stock. I clearly have invested both my career and have made a move to Cleveland, Ohio to do this business and I don’t know how much more invested I can get, to be honest with you. Having said that --
Sam Shapiro - Shapiro Capital: But I think that Walt it’s pretty simple, you write a check. That’s how you get invested. You got an $800,000 signing bonus, I believe, and I don’t know of another CEO in the country that has never bought stock in his own company. And I’m not talking about the options that you were given, I’m talking about making an investment with you and your team. I’ve never heard of this before, I’m 66 years old and you joined a company and you haven’t invested $0.10. It’s not like you came from General Motors or Intel. I think it’s reasonable to expect by all the other gentlemen on this phone too, that you get your checkbook out and you buy a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of stock. That makes us all feel better, because if not next quarter we’ll have the same excuses --- delay in Mexico, stainless steel. This has been going on for seven quarters now. I think the shareholders are entitled.
Walter Rosebrough: Sam, I certainly appreciate your comments and understand them. I expect fully to continue to have conversations with you about shareholdings and management and me personally. I do appreciate the comments and I appreciate your views. By the way, I don’t feel like I’ve been given anything. You’re incorrect by the way in the signing bonus amount by actually two or three, and possibly more. That’s thing number 1, and number 2 is I don’t believe I’ve been given anything, by the way I would not expect or want to be given anything, I fully expect to earn it and I fully expect to help this company grow and prosper.
Sam Shapiro - Shapiro Capital: But I don’t think we should sit here and take up too much time, but I think probably you have better relations with other gentlemen on this call than me. So what you’re probably should do in quiet is, why don’t you kind of poll them and say should I own stock? I would be embarrassed if I was a CEO of a company and I didn’t own any stock in the company.
Walter Rosebrough: I appreciate your comments Sam. Thank you.
Sam Shapiro - Shapiro Capital: Thank you.
Operator:  Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review, your line is open.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Hello, I thank you again. You talked about the new product introductions and so forth. I’m just wondering on the other side of things, what you’re doing relative to the sales force? Will that be expanded to commensurate with these new products or will it be the existing people be selling the wider bag, if you will?
Walter Rosebrough: You know we did expand our sales force last year on the hospital side for that purpose. We’ve also, on the P&R side, expanded our sales force and focused it on the large customers in pharma. I fully expect that we will, although I do not have a forecast for exactly what we’re going to do at this point, but the conversation is always an ongoing conversation of business as a general statement, it is very difficult to expand your business significantly if you don’t expand your sales force.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay and one last quick one. I don’t know if it was mentioned but what were consumables and services as a percentage of the total for the quarter?
Walter Rosebrough: Those numbers are coming.
Walter Rosebrough: For the quarter, capital is 41.1% in the quarter, Greg.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay.
Walter Rosebrough: Consumables were 23.2%. Service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were worth 35.7%.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Joshua Zable, with Natixis, your line is open.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Thanks very much. Hey guys, just a quick follow up. Just some housekeeping here --- sorry to waste people’s time but just kind of... I know you sort of went over the different segment revenue growth Mike. Can you just go over those, just give us some numbers? I know you generally give us rounded numbers, just in terms of... just literally go through healthcare equipment, consumables, and services. I know Aidan sort of gave us some sort of breakdown, but just so I can update the model.
Michael Topich: Sure. We have for the quarter, for healthcare capital was basically flat, consumables was 12% growth, service was 7% growth, for a total of 5% growth for the quarter in healthcare.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay.
Michael Topich:  Life sciences capital was 4%, consumables were 8%, service was 5%, for a total of 5% for life sciences and then in total capital grew 1%, consumables grew 11%, service grew 6%, for a total of 5% for the whole company.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  Okay, great. I guess, just related to the guidance here, obviously you gave a range and that’s what it is, but as we think about the fourth quarter numbers, what has to go right for you guys to hit the numbers? Is it basically a matter of executing now that you’ve obviously you’ve sort of found these issues? Not issues, but you sort of have to deal with these capacity constraints and production constraints, or is it hinder on demand as well?
Michael Topich:  I would say, with rare exception it is hitting the production constraints, not demand at this point. There can be some ridiculously unexpected change in demand and consumables occurred, you know, that would be obviously a detriment, but there’s no reason to expect that.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  Sure. No I understand... 
Michael Topich:  Orders are largely booked for what we’re going to do for the balance of the year so we’re pretty much into execution.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  Great.
Walter Rosebrough: Just one other thing that I’d would add to that Josh, is that we are assuming a little bit of an easier comparison on raw materials in the fourth quarter as well, so that has to go right as well.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:  Okay, great. Thank you very much guys.
Michael Topich:  Thank you.
Operator: I show no other questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back over for any closing remarks.
Walter Rosebrough:  Okay, thanks very much Holly. That concludes Steris’ fiscal 2008, third quarter call.

All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including without limitations the risks detailed in the company’s filings and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements are only predictions and actual results may differ materially from those projected.  Now I would like to turn the call over to R. Scott Jones, President and CEO of Cantel Medical. Go ahead, Scott. 
R. Scott Jones: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end earnings call. With me today are: Charles Diker, Chairman; Andy Krakauer, Chief Operating Officer; Craig Sheldon, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Anaya, VP and Corporate Controller; and Roy Malkin, President of Cantel’s Minntech division. We will all be available for questions after our remarks.  As you all know, since our last earnings quarter, we’ve completed the acquisitions of Dialysis Services, Twist 2 It, Verimetrix, and most recently Strong Dental Products, and first I would like to welcome those new employees and customers joining us with these acquisitions.  I think what you will see here today is that we are really building value, not only in Cantel but across our segments. As we move through today’s call, I would encourage you to think in terms of three key themes that we think relate to our building of that value. The first is that we’ve had very good core growth. Both the quarter and the year have exceeded consensus estimates in terms of revenues by a fairly good margin.  We’ve made very substantial investments in the company during 2006 and 2007 and those are really now beginning to pay off in terms of top line growth. Just by way of reminder, those investments were the fielding of our MediVators direct sales force. We now have 21 direct sales people that are really hitting stride and doing a good job. We’ve substantially completed the R&D of our MDS Endoscope reprocessing premium care product. We’ve expended capital to accommodate order growth across virtually all of our segments. We’ve fielded marketing sales resources across virtually all of our segments and we’ve added several key executive leaders; notably, we appointed the President of our water purification and filtration division earlier in the year, and most recently we have appoint a VP of market development to address alternative markets across Cantel, and with that, welcome to Matt Conlon and welcome to the team.  Point number two, our game now or our focus really is building out and solidifying our existing segments. It’s about product platforms and proprietary branded products. We’ll obtain those products in two ways; one, through our internal development, our own R&D, and secondly through key selective acquisitions. A couple examples of our own internal development would be our new patient’s choice line of dental products, our heat sanitizable water purification system, our Actril sporicidal disinfectant wipes, and of course MDS endoscope reprocessing product.  A couple examples of very selective add-on acquisitions would be the Verimetrix leak testing technology, Strong Dental Products, our Twist 2 It Prophy Angle and of course, our GE Water Purification acquisition earlier in the year.  Theme or point number three, diversification among our segments has been and we feel will continue to be beneficial to Cantel. As we all well know, industry dynamics sometimes change and sometimes frankly they change unexpectedly. We’ve benefited from that diversification this year, as you will see in our dialysis and dental segments. I think the dynamics in both cases exemplify this trend.  Let’s look at some of the highlights for the quarter. Revenue growth was 25% for the quarter to $62.513 million and 14% for the year. We ended our year at $219,044,000. Organic growth was 15% for the quarter and 10% for the year versus the same periods in 2006.  We reported $0.12 for the fourth quarter versus $0.06 in the corresponding quarter of ’06. This includes $0.02 for expenses related to acquisitions and executive transition, and $0.03 for stock compensation.  For the year, we reported $0.50 versus $0.41 in the corresponding period of ’06. That is 22% growth in earnings per share. That includes $0.03 of expenses for acquisitions and executive transition and $0.06 in stock compensation.  As planned, we were able to lower our corporate tax rate to under 40% in the fourth quarter. We’ve completed and fully integrated two acquisitions during the fiscal year and three since July 31st, and still at this point our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about two turns, and when pro forma-ing GE into the equation, it is 1.8 turns, so we have a good clean balance sheet and lots of capacity, if need be.  Let’s take a closer look at our segments. Endoscope reprocessing, we grew at 39% in the fourth quarter to $10,801,000; 28% growth for the year, ending the year at $38,941,000. That is really attributable to our MediVators direct hospital sales and service force. They are really hitting stride right now, and now with the addition of the Verimetrix proprietary leak detection and fluid test product line, will have more products in the basket and more solutions for our endoscope reprocessing customers.  This is a great example again of building value in our segments by adding on very specific proprietary product extensions.  We’ve substantially completed our MDS premium tier product, which has received FDA approval for sales in the U.S. It is now, by the way, being marketed under the name MediVators Advantage.  All manufacturing and R&D has been moved from The Netherlands to the U.S. The purpose of this was to improve our focus on product launch and to accelerate our return to profitability.  As we’ve reported throughout the year, we’ve made very substantial investments in this product line, which have resulted in operating losses throughout the year, but we have really set the stage for the future and we expect to return to profitability in ’08.  Water purification and filtration, we’ve had an increase in revenues by 58% in the fourth quarter to $16,459,000. That equates to 10% organic growth without GE, and 35% growth for the year to $49,032,000, which for the fiscal year equates to 16% organic growth without GE. The GE acquisition has worked out very well for us. The integration is complete. We have built out our state-of-the-art, 20,000 foot facility which, by the way, is co-located with the Minntech Campus in Minneapolis and I am proud to say that we haven’t missed a single shipment in the process.  The transaction has proven to be a very good one for us. We’ve added a dedicated sales force for the commercial and industrial portion of our business, so what that means is now we have a separate medical sales force, we have a separate commercial and industrial sales force, and we have a separate sales force to focus on filtration and sterilants. So each of these dedicated sales forces are targeted to a specific end user market segments.  The GE acquisition has clearly made us the leader in dialysis water, and we have an opportunity to grow into other areas with this new dedicated sales approach. A couple of examples that have been immediate wins, in July we received a large order for a large power generation facility in Ontario for steam generation. That order is approximately $700,000 in revenues. We’ve likewise received a large repeat order from a bottling company in the beverage space, so we continue to be selective in evaluating growth opportunities not only in medical but outside of medical to help us grow.  In the sterilants area, our Actril sporicidal surface disinfectant, which by the way is more effective on blood borne pathogen than conventional bleach, is being validated by a large pharmaceutical manufacture in Europe and we fully expect them to standardize on our product as a surface disinfectant, so this is very exciting. We like the water segment, as you can see.  Dialysis; interestingly, in the fourth quarter we’ve benefited from 19% organic growth to $16.924 million in the fourth quarter. Revenues, however, were flat for the year at $58.696 million. Again, here you're seeing the benefits of diversification. Our dialysis segment has rebounded quite nicely and we are back to getting growth in that segment.  We are pleased with what our team has accomplished in this segment during the year. They've sustained -- and in fact improved -- profitability in what was a declining market earlier in the year, and maintained excellent cash flow. Meanwhile, our key client -- which by the way, happens to be the second-largest dialysis provider in the U.S. -- remains dedicated to dialyzer reuse. They continue to have exceptional growth, they're building new clinics and we, obviously as their partner, benefit from the expansion of these clinics. In fact, we have grown our Renatron sales by 33% in the fourth quarter. So obviously, with our partner tooling up and making investments in capital equipment, we are very bullish on the future of dialyzer reprocessing. Likewise we have benefited from the largest international shipment ever to Asia. We've shipped 179 units to China, which is a good growth market for us, during 2007 which helped international growth grow by 46%. The decline we experienced earlier in the year due to the consolidation with Fresenius acquiring Renal Care Group appears to be substantially behind us. Procedure growth appears to remain strong at about 8%, and we expect to see many more clinics being built in the foreseeable future. Healthcare disposables, just a side note, we previously reported this as dental. We have had 6% growth for the year to $57.61 million but experienced a decline of 2% to $14.32 million in the fourth quarter. This is attributable to an unforeseen consolidation in our dental distributors. Becker Parkin was sold to Darby and to Henry Schein and that resulted in a one-time depletion of inventories. As you know, that results in a temporary reduction in our orders. The dental market is still large and strong. It's $13 billion worldwide and growing at 6%, so there's a lot more opportunity for us to pursue, not only in the U.S. but worldwide, largely attributable to the expansion of aesthetic dentistry and favorable demographics. So it's still a very good market. This past week we attended and exhibited at the American Dental Association meeting. At the meeting we introduced our Strong Dental Products. Strong Dental Products is a suite of patient comfort and protection barriers for x-ray procedures. This product will enable us to tap into the fast-growing dental sub-segment of digital x-ray imaging which we understand to be growing north of 15% on a compounded annual growth rate. Likewise, we exhibited our new Twist 2 It unique prophy angle product. Both those products, along with the rest of our Patient's Choice branded proprietary product line, were very well received. Here again, a side note. It's all about development of product platforms and proprietary products, and this is the trend that you will continue to see with Cantel. We are committed to the healthcare disposables segment. Specialty packaging grew by 9% in the fourth quarter to $1.516 million and by 34% to $6.979 million for the year. We've made investments in marketing and sales in this segment as well as launching new products. We have had tremendous growth in the segment. It is, by the way, our smallest segment and obviously to sustain this percentage level of growth may not be realistic forever, but we are certainly enjoying continued good growth in the segment. We have had good adoption of our proprietary product technologies.  By the way, those technologies are the transportation of biological samples in extreme thermal and atmospheric changes. A large national organ regeneration company is exclusively using our thermal control products and is quite pleased. We've really put our product to the test recently, because NASA recently utilized our products on the recent space shuttle mission and we feel as though that's about as extreme a thermal and atmospheric condition as you can get to test a product. We are proud of that. Therapeutic filtration grew by 41% in the fourth quarter to $2.493 million and by 11% to $7.786 million for the fiscal year. Growth was primarily driven by the return of our pediatric Vapotherm product to the market and continued strong sales of our hemoconcentrators. Now I'm going to turn it over to Craig to fill in of the specific financial detail. We will then loop back to me and I will summarize. We will wrap up, and then we will take questions. 
 Craig Sheldon: Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. Let me go through some of the numbers for the quarter and the year. Let me start off by indicating that the GE Water acquisition, which we completed on March 30, is included in our consolidated results of operations for the last four months of fiscal 2007. So that would include the entire fourth quarter since the date of the acquisition on March 30, and GE Water is not included in our results of operations for any portion of fiscal 2006. Also, we completed the Twist acquisition in our healthcare disposables segment on July 9 and the impact on operations for the portion of the month of July from this deal is inconsequential. Finally, the three acquisitions completed subsequent to the end of the year-- DSI, Verimetrix and Strong Dental -- are not reflected in our results for any of the periods presented. As Scott mentioned, revenues for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year increased by 25% and 14% respectively compared to last year's periods, and without the impact of the GE acquisition. I would point out that GE contributed revenues of $4.994 million in the fourth quarter and $6.949 million for the fiscal year. So without these revenues, the organic growth was up 15% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the fiscal year. Income from continuing operations for the company in the fourth quarter more than doubled to $1.899 million. This compares to $922,000 in the fourth quarter of last year. For fiscal 2007, income from continuing operations increased by 22% to $8.104 million and this compares to $6.653 million in fiscal 2006. For both the fourth quarter as well as the fiscal year, the year-over-year increase in earnings resulted primarily from improved performance in our dialysis segment, as well as continued growth in the water purification, specialty packaging and therapeutics segments. Also for the year, healthcare disposables was also an important contributor to our improved performance. One more item I would like to point out about the GE Water Dialysis acquisition. In fiscal 2007, this acquisition contributed approximately $1.1 million in incremental operating earnings. After you consider the interest and the one-time acquisition costs and you tax effect everything, GE Water added approximately $0.01 of incremental earnings per share to the company, for the four months. Now I would like to go back and look at a few other components of the income statement. Starting out with gross profit percentage for the fourth quarter, it decreased to 33.8%, and that compares to 34.6% in the same quarter of last year. This decrease was primarily attributable to sales mix in both our dialysis and water purification segments and that includes the addition of GE Water. Those sales carry a margin of approximately 28%. For the year, the gross profit percentage was 36.1% so it was virtually flat compared with last year at 36.0%. Looking at operating expenses for the fourth quarter, $17.087 million. That's an increase of 17% compared to last year's fourth quarter and that's 27% of revenues. That's an improvement over the 29% of revenues last year. For the full fiscal year, operating expenses were $62.173 million. That’s an increase of 15% compared to fiscal 2006. As a percentage of revenues, that would be 28%, which is the same as the 28% last year. First focusing on the gross dollar increases in operating expenses, this was primarily attributable to the U.S. direct sales and service initiative for the endoscope reprocessing business; the infrastructure and the transaction costs associated with our acquisition of GE Water; as well as additional investments in personnel to support growth both in the selling areas and the G&A areas. This was across virtually all of our product segments. I also wanted to point out when you look at operating expenses as a percentage of revenue -- and I mentioned that it was 27% in the quarter, which is an improvement from 29% in last year's fourth quarter -- this was by and large due to the GE Water acquisition. So even though GE Water only contributed a gross profit percentage of about 28%, the infrastructure is very, very small with that acquisition and thus we have excellent drop through to the operating earnings line. Moving down to interest expense for the quarter, net interest was $962,000 in the fourth quarter. That compares to $705,000 in last year's fourth quarter. The acquisition of GE Water contributed about $413,000 in interest expense for the fourth quarter, so without GE Water, our interest would have been much lower than last year. That's due to significant repayments of debt over the past year. For the full fiscal year, interest expense decreased to $2.737 million. That compares to $3.393 million in fiscal 2006. Again, that is despite the acquisition of GE, which carried interest expense of about $570,000. So overall, a very significant reduction in interest and once again that's due to significant repayments of debt over the past year. Lastly on the income statement, our effective tax rate. A bit of a complicated discussion, but important to go into a little bit of depth here. I will start out by indicating that in the fourth quarter, our overall effective tax rate was 38%. This is a dramatic improvement over last year's fourth quarter, when it was 56.5%. For the full fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 42.5%, compared to fiscal 2006 of 44.3%. Additionally, the fourth quarter was a big improvement over the first nine months of the fiscal year, where you may recall we carried an effective tax rate of 43.8%.  Let me start off by pointing out, and this is a repeat of a discussion from last quarter, that the reason for the very high effective tax rate, both in the initial nine months of this year as well as all fiscal 2006, was principally attributable to the geographic mix of our pre-tax income, and more specifically, the losses that we incurred at our Netherlands operation.  We had indicated last quarter that we expected to get a significant improvement in our tax rate in the fourth quarter as we wound down the R&D efforts at our Netherlands business and relocated the business to the U.S. I'm pleased to say that we've accomplished that, as I mentioned, coming in with a rate of 38% in the fourth quarter.  Looking ahead to fiscal 2008, I would expect our overall effective tax rate to be approximately 40% next year, or perhaps slightly lower, although I would caution that it is very difficult to predict our effective tax rate with any precision due to the uncertainty over where our pre-tax income is going to fall. That is certainly good news on the tax front. Now taking a little more specific look at some of our operating segments. Let me start out with the water segment. As Scott had indicated, the revenues for the fourth quarter in water were up 58%, or 10% on an organic basis compared to last year and for the fiscal year revenues were up 35%, or 16% organically without GE Water.  The operating earnings for our water purification and filtration business in the fourth quarter were $1.616 million. That compares to $631,000 in the same quarter of last year. For the full fiscal year, operating earnings in water were $4.414 million. That compares to $2.758 million in fiscal 2006.  The year-over-year increases in operating earnings were substantial, primarily attributable to the contribution of the GE Water acquisition which in the fourth quarter, GE Water contributed approximately $800,000 in operating earnings. For the four months since the date of the acquisition, contributed approximately $1.1 million in operating earnings. Once again, as I pointed out before, these operating earnings does not include the one-time acquisition charges which we report as part of corporate expenses and does not include the interest expense which is on a separate line.  But equally important, if you pull out the effect of the GE Water operating earnings, we still have very nice growth in excess of 20% in operating earnings for the quarter and the year, due to the increased sales of capital equipment and service in our existing business. So all in all, we are extremely pleased with the strong start to the GE Water acquisition. As we move into fiscal 2008, I would anticipate even further improvements. As we gain some operating efficiencies, we will leverage the additional sales against our existing infrastructure and we will continue to make improvements in our supply chain management. Dialysis revenues for the fourth quarter went up by 19% compared to last year, and for the year were flat. Looking at operating earnings for our dialysis business in the fourth quarter, $2.26 million, a significant improvement over the $1.96 million in last year's fourth quarter. For the fiscal year -- and this again, is despite the fact that sales for the year were flat in dialysis -- the operating earnings were $8.117 million; again, a significant improvement over the $6.915 million in fiscal 2006. So once again, although the revenues clearly were impacted by the industry consolidation as we've already reported, the earnings were sustained, and in fact improved considerably, due to favorable product and customer mix, particularly in the concentrated area where we got rid of a lot of very low margin or no margin business. Additionally, the strength of our key reuse customers is very, very strong and we have been able to lower manufacturing and distribution costs. So really, when we look back at this dialysis segment and we see that we had for the year 17% overall growth in earnings during 2007, we view this as being extremely impressive, given the dynamic changes that have occurred in this industry. Our renal team really deserves just a tremendous amount of credit for their perseverance through all this industry consolidation. Moving onto our healthcare disposable segment, again, formerly called dental, our revenues for the fourth quarter were down by 2% and for the fiscal year revenues were up by 6% versus last year. Operating earnings in this segment for the fourth quarter were $1.794 million compared to $2.185 million in the same quarter last year. For fiscal 2007, operating earnings were $8.753 million compared to $7.917 million in fiscal 2006. Really, the year-over-year trend in earnings is tied directly into the trend in the sales volume of the business. Endoscope reprocessing revenues for the fourth quarter were up by 39% over last year, and for the full fiscal year up by 28%, compared to last year. The endoscope reprocessing business had an operating loss in the fourth quarter of $115,000. This compares to an operating loss in last year's fourth quarter of $596,000. For the full fiscal year we had an operating loss of $509,000 and this compares to operating earnings of $2.451 million in fiscal 2006. We reported extensively before the reasons why we've had losses in the business this year. Just once again quickly, we sustained losses primarily due to our substantial investments in our U.S. direct sales and service initiative, as well as the continued development of the MediVators Advantage product line. That's our former Dyped product line, as Scott reported before. As you may recall in last year's fourth quarter, the reason we had a loss there is because we had incurred some expenses of about $800,000 last year to commence our direct sales strategy in preparation for the termination of the Olympus distribution agreement. In our therapeutic filtration segment, revenues for the fourth quarter were up by 41% versus last year and for the year, revenues were up by 11%. The operating earnings for therapeutic in the fourth quarter were $430,000. This compares to $117,000 last year. For the year, operating earnings were $1.385 million. This compares to $1.046 million in fiscal 2006. Here again, the growth in earnings was primarily driven by increased revenue volume and this includes the recommencement of our Vapotherm sales. In our specialty packaging segment, our revenues for the fourth quarter were up by 9% and for the fiscal year up by 34% compared to last year. The operating earnings really followed this trend. For the fourth quarter, operating earnings for specialty packaging were $186,000. This compares to $50,000 last year. Fiscal 2007 operating earnings were $1.908 million and this compares to $676,000 in fiscal 2006.  So again, significant revenue growth, including our high margin compliance training products. So all in all, just a fantastic year for our specialty packaging business. A few quick comments on the balance sheet. As always, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet. At July 31st we had $15.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, a current ratio of 2.1:1; $57 million in outstanding debt under our term and revolving credit facilities. That $57 million includes $23 million outstanding under our revolver and that entire $23 million is directly attributable to the GE Water deal. So had we not done that acquisition we would be completely debt free as far as our revolver is concerned. We had net debt at July 31st of $41.1 million and a debt to equity ratio of 0.37.  A few other items on our debt, some significant changes in the fourth quarter as well as subsequent to the end of the year. We amended our credit facilities in the fourth quarter, specifically our revolving credit facility where we increased the capacity under that facility from previously $35 million up to $50 million. Additionally, we were able to get reduced borrowing rates on all of our outstanding debt. We actually obtained 50 basis point improvements on our borrowings under LIBOR contracts and that affects actually both our revolver as well as our term facility. Subsequent to year end, we have actually already utilized a portion of the additional borrowing capacity to fund the acquisition of DSI, Verimetrix and Strong Dental and presently today we have $67.1 million of outstanding debt under our credit facilities. This includes $34.6 million under the revolving credit facility, so we still have some capacity left there.  I would finish out by saying that during fiscal 2008 we will really be focused very, very hard on optimizing the performance from our existing businesses, completing the integration of all of these acquisitions; definitely reducing our debt levels and just continuing to strengthen our overall balance sheet. So at this point, Scott, I will turn the call back over to you.
 R. Scott Jones: There you have it. I will make a few comments and then we will ramp up and take questions and answers. In summary, let me recap our thoughts. The stage is set. We are building value across all of our segments. We have had a terrific top line growth, our investments are now beginning to pay off in terms of revenues. We now need to drill down and harvest the synergies that we've proposed and acquired under our acquisitions, as well as the cost savings that have been put in place throughout the year. Lastly, we will see a continued focus on marketing and product development as we fill out our segments with proprietary new products. This is very much a priority for us going forward. So with that, one more reminder. That is that our 10-K will be filed no later than Monday, so more detail will be following in the 10-K. Operator, let's go ahead and open for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from Michael Gaugler - Brean Murray.
 Michael Gaugler - Brean Murray: I will start off with the endo reprocessing segment. As we look forward to potential profits and margins, would you expect those to be in line with the company average?
 R. Scott Jones: They will certainly get there. We have full expectations that once we are up to a steady state with the launch of our new product and full penetration with our MediVators sales force that the endoscope reprocessing segment will be very much at par with the rest of the segment. Now that, of course, will take time. We are expecting to return to profitability forthwith. But that will ramp up over time and it won't be an immediate return to those levels, but we will certainly get there.
 Michael Gaugler - Brean Murray: Last quarter, the acquisition-related charges that we saw for the deals that were consummated in '07, are they essentially behind you now?
 R. Scott Jones: The acquisition charges for those acquisitions are behind us. They are specific to those acquisitions that we did.
 Michael Gaugler - Brean Murray: Finally, how does the pipeline for new opportunities look? I know that you were looking a little bit towards the west coast to build out the water treatment platform a bit more. Are you seeing anything interesting at the moment?
 R. Scott Jones: The pipeline looks great. We want to give credit to our corporate development function. Under Seth Siegel's leadership we have really identified a tremendous pipeline. As you can imagine, you've got to turn over a lot of stones before you find the right acquisition. So it's a matter of timing. We find we would like to continue fleshing out our service delivery network and we have identified an opportunity on the west coast. We've identified another larger opportunity that has several geographic fill-ins for us. So it's a matter of timing and valuation. Hopefully before long we will be able to execute on those opportunities.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Co.
 Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: The organic growth for the year, was it 10% for the top line?
 R. Scott Jones:  That's correct.
 Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: As you look out to '08 do you expect that to hold steady or even improve further?
 R. Scott Jones: We've got some good momentum across all of our segments at this point and again, we never know. There are no guarantees in terms of industry consolidation anywhere. Our objective is certainly to maintain that momentum that we have right now. So it is certainly our goal to keep up the pace.
 Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: I know you did address the dialysis line, but clearly the number this quarter was probably the best we've seen for some time. Anything in particular that is a good run rate to use going forward?
 R. Scott Jones:  It's two things. As I mentioned, the consolidation with Fresenius and Renal Care Group is behind us so that certainly had a big impact on certainly the first couple of quarters in the year. Our largest client is growing very rapidly and we continue, as I said, fourth quarter we had 33% growth in Renatron unit sales. So that's terrific. In those numbers however, and I will let Roy Malkin comment on this as well, in those numbers we continued to have a very robust set of orders for dialysate concentrate. And that includes the company that does single use. We are also a big vendor to them. So it's a mix of Renatron sales, both from the U.S. and International as well as very strong orders for the concentrate. Roy, do you want to add anything to that?
Roy Malkin: I think you are right on, Scott. The major impact in the fourth quarter was some substantial sales to Latin America of our concentrate product. As we've reported over the last few years, we have really taken advantage of opportunities where they exist and last quarter was a very, very good quarter for us. Also, we had an excellent quarter in Asia for our renal product. So all in all, I think that renal growth will remain reasonably constant this year. That really depends on our continued success in Latin America.
 R. Scott Jones: What I would add is what we're seeing is procedure growth is growing in the upper single-digits. If I were to gauge what the appropriate growth would be in the segment, I would rather link it to what procedure growth is at, so 7% or 8% is probably reasonable. It takes a while to translate procedure growth into our order rate, but that's what I think we would like to think of it as for the coming year.
 Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti: With regard to stock compensation expense, I know it picked up a little this year. Looking ahead to fiscal '08, should we assume it's going to be pretty flat?
 R. Scott Jones: The majority of the stock comp expense is divesting of existing options and restricted shares that had been issued years ago. So that's the majority of our stock expense and as we add new executives, a vital part of the yearly compensation for the leadership team is the equity compensation. So we would expect to layer on more equity as the years go by. But again, really, the bulk of it is the legacy vesting.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Cooper - Wells Capital.
 Mark Cooper - Wells Capital: Did you give us the D&A and the cash flow number for the fourth quarter or for the year?
 R. Scott Jones: The cash flow will be in the 10-K. Is the D&A in there also?
 Craig Sheldon: Yes. Everything will be in the 10-K. 
 R. Scott Jones: That, as I said, will be out no later than Monday. It is probably the best source of that.
 Mark Cooper - Wells Capital: You don't have that information now? 
 R. Scott Jones:  Just hold on that because we are still under audit at this point and we are just not ready to file the K.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
 R. Scott Jones: That about wraps it up. Once again, thank you for your continued interest and support. I look forward to interacting with all of you. If you have any questions, please feel free to call. Thank you.
